guidelines <em>Autism: recognition, referral and diagnosis of children and young people on the autism spectrum </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/autism-in-children/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women&rsquo;s and Children&rsquo;s Health, 2017</a>] and <em>Autism spectrum disorder in under 19s: recognition, referral and diagnosis </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/autism-in-children/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>], and are based largely on the expert opinion of the NICE guideline development group as NICE found limited good-quality evidence to inform recommendations on when to suspect autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  The recommendations are in line with those in the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guideline <em>Assessment, diagnosis and interventions for autism spectrum disorders</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/autism-in-children/references/\">SIGN, 2016</a>].</p><h5>Referral to the autism team if available </h5><ul><li>NICE identified one study which compared clinical diagnosis by a single practitioner with that of a panel. It reported moderate agreement between an individual healthcare professional and a multidisciplinary team in making a diagnosis, but it was a low-quality study. NICE states that in practice, a diagnosis of ASD can be made by a single experienced healthcare professional; however, the label of autism does not constitute a complete diagnostic assessment and a profile of the child or young person’s strengths and weaknesses is also essential. This requires a multidisciplinary team (the autism team) which has the skills to carry out an autism diagnostic assessment and to communicate with children and young people with suspected or known autism (and with their parents and/or carers) and sensitively share the diagnosis with them [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/autism-in-children/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women&rsquo;s and Children&rsquo;s Health, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/autism-in-children/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].<ul><li>The core members of the autism team should include a paediatrician and/or child and adolescent psychiatrist, speech and language therapist, and a clinical and/or educational psychologist.</li><li>The team should include or have regular access to a paediatrician or paediatric neurologist, child and adolescent psychiatrist, educational psychologist, clinical psychologist, and occupational therapist, if they are not already in the team. Other healthcare professionals, such as a specialist health visitor or nurse, specialist teacher, or social worker, may be involved on a needs basis.</li></ul></li><li>SIGN recommends that a diagnostic assessment, alongside a profile of the person’s strengths and weaknesses, carried out by a multidisciplinary team which has the skills and experience to undertake the assessments, should be considered as the optimum approach for people suspected of having ASD. The use of different professional groups in the assessment process is recommended as it may identify different aspects of ASD and aid accurate diagnosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/autism-in-children/references/\">SIGN, 2016</a>].</li></ul><h5>Referral to a paediatrician or a child and adolescent psychiatrist if an autism team is not available</h5><ul><li>The availability of autism teams vary locally. CKS has therefore based this recommendation on pragmatic considerations to allow referral, if needed, to other appropriate professionals.</li></ul><h5>When to consider immediate referral </h5><ul><li>In the opinion of the NICE GDG, parental concerns and risk factors are important factors in deciding if immediate referral for specialist assessment is indicated.<ul><li>Parental concerns:<ul><li>Will be based on a detailed knowledge of their child's behaviour and should therefore play an active part in the assessment of the possibility of ASD.</li><li>May be unfounded but if this is the case, assessment by a specialist may more effectively allay these concerns.</li></ul></li><li>The presence of risk factors will increase the likelihood of a diagnosis of ASD.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Review following a period of watchful waiting</h5><ul><li>In the expert opinion of the NICE GDG:<ul><li>Children or young people with a low probability of ASD should be given a period of watchful waiting to see if features suggestive of ASD resolve or become more apparent.</li><li>People who refuse referral may feel overwhelmed by the possibility of a diagnosis of ASD and need more time to accept the need for referral.</li></ul></li><li>The NICE GDG did not specify the duration of watchful waiting. Based on pragmatic considerations, CKS recommends using clinical judgement in each individual case to decide on the duration of watchful waiting.</li></ul><h5>Continued refusal to accept referral following review</h5><ul><li>In the expert opinion of the NICE GDG, it is important that parents and/or carers and, if appropriate, the children or young person are in agreement with the plan to refer. However, if they continue to refuse referral, the best interest of the child or young person needs to be considered and, if necessary, specialist advice should be sought to resolve the problem.</li></ul><h5>Information to include on the referral form</h5><ul><li>The NICE GDG recommends providing these details because they are generally readily available in the medical records kept by the GP and are important factors in helping to establish or refute a diagnosis of ASD.</li></ul><!-- end field ef455aed-8900-48d5-b054-f109cf60e197 --><!-- end item 0d9f231b-dfe3-47d3-9be1-9f7d13630355 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
