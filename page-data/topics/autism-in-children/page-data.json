However, a number of different genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role in the development.</li><li>The estimated prevalence in children is at least 1%.</li><li>ASD is a life-long disorder. The severity and impact varies greatly depending on age, development, and presence or absence of associated conditions.</li><li>The prognosis of ASD can be improved by early diagnosis and assessment because this aids understanding of why the child or young person is different from their peers. Early diagnosis also ensures that the child or young person and their family and/or carers have prompt access to support and services in education, health services, and social care; a route into voluntary organizations; and contact with other children and families with similar experiences. All of these can improve the lives of the child or young person and their family and/or carers.</li><li>The diagnosis of ASD is established by a specialist following referral. Ideally this is carried out by an autism team if available (or if not, by a paediatrician or a child and adolescent psychiatrist [dependant on local referral policy]).</li><li>Primary care management of children and young people with confirmed ASD generally includes:<ul><li>Routine review, where appropriate.</li><li>Ensuring those with ASD and an associated mental health or behavioural disorder are reviewed by a specialist.</li><li>Ensuring that parents and/or carers are well informed about ASD and the support available.</li><li>Initial management of sleep problems and behaviour that challenges.</li><li>Ensuring that young people with ASD are reassessed in secondary care to establish the need for continuing treatment into adulthood. </li></ul></li><li>Secondary care management includes:<ul><li>Developing a care plan and identifying a key worker or case manager.</li><li>Offering specialist interventions to support the development of social and communication skills.</li><li>Review of children and young people with an associated mental health or developmental disorder.</li><li>Offering specialist interventions to support the development of social and communication skills.</li><li>Considering pharmacological interventions to help manage behaviour that challenges.</li><li>Supporting access and maintaining contact with educational, housing, and employment services. </li><li>Providing information to parents and/or carers.</li><li>Planning the transition of a young person's care into adult services.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field bad299bd-d2aa-4993-8df3-2eacf2e57012 --><!-- end item f4f7905a-674c-4f50-9a13-2679fa00b62b -->","topic":{"id":"3d9f48c8-37bc-5d75-8620-a889a3d26b6c","topicId":"dded286c-cea8-4cea-b71b-0d2fb3901796","topicName":"Autism in children","slug":"autism-in-children","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"913c5826-d299-5de0-877e-e8aeb7b19fd6","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"691a24a8-98e4-5a92-b6f3-015075253332","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"3e6ac9c6-f1a6-58dd-8137-0754ab7ef812","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"b653efa1-762f-5230-8424-405a7d5b3231","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"1247dbf0-200e-55df-ac0e-cbc4c05c0060","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"579ed566-140b-55cf-b5d7-57ef8317c868","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"186b807b-09e0-5fd1-90f3-e9f60b6d6d69","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"1956c410-0e94-5cd1-9669-4f5221345eb5","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"7048a532-550b-5eb7-a26b-0e204d5eb736","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"7c396d39-31cd-5c19-a040-93603d4db12e","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"f6ad135c-4293-511d-bca4-54d43d5a712a","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
