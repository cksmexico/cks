The diagnosis of stereotypic movement disorder is not made if the behaviour is better explained by ASD unless the behaviour causes injuries, in which case both diagnoses may be appropriate.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Mental health and behavioural disorders, including:</strong><ul><li>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder — the child or young person is able to demonstrate social reciprocity and appropriate non-verbal communication, understands the rules of social norms, and does not usually react with marked distress to stimuli to which they are overly sensitive. The behaviour is driven by impulsivity with an understanding of the potential dangers. See the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/\">Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> for more information.</li><li>Mood disorder — usually episodic events with a history of 'normal' social behaviour when not depressed or severely anxious.</li><li>Anxiety disorder — anxiety can be associated with repetitive behaviour, but not typically stereotyped. The child or young person will also have an interest in, and care about, the opinions of others. See the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/generalized-anxiety-disorder/\">Generalized anxiety disorder</a> for more information.</li><li>Attachment disorders — the child or young person usually shows normal imaginative play and does not show over intense or unusual interests. They tend to make rapid progress when exposed to a more nurturing environment, including nursery, school, or foster placement.</li><li>Oppositional defiant disorder — the child or young person usually understands that their behaviour is undesirable or unacceptable but still deliberately persists with the behaviour. They are able to show an understanding and competence of accepted social interaction and have no stereotypic or repetitive behaviour.</li><li>Conduct disorder — there is evidence of competence in social relationships and absence of early social communication problems. The behaviour of the child or young person can also show sophisticated strategies to avoid detection. See the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/conduct-disorders-in-children-young-people/\">Conduct disorders in children and young people</a> for more information.</li><li>Obsessive compulsive disorder — the onset of symptoms usually occurs after 4 years of age, and behaviours are usually associated with the child or young person being distressed. The content of obsessions and rituals are usually associated with avoiding harm and magical thinking. See the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/\">Obsessive-compulsive disorder</a> for more information.</li><li>Schizophrenia — usually develops after a period of normal, or near normal, development. Hallucinations and/or delusions are defining features of the condition. See the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/psychosis-schizophrenia/\">Psychosis and schizophrenia</a> for more information.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Conditions where there is developmental regression, including:</strong><ul><li>Rett syndrome — mainly affects girls and is characterized by motor regression, ataxia, a loss of purposeful hand movements ('hand-wringing' movements are characteristic), and oro-motor skills.</li><li>Epileptic encephalopathy — the onset of symptoms is usually over a period of a few days and typically develops between the ages of 2–7 years after a period of normal development. It is characterized by the inability to recognize and interpret environmental sounds and the loss of previously acquired words and understanding of language. Social interest and play are preserved.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Other conditions, such as:</strong><ul><li>Severe hearing impairment — non-verbal communication, play, imagination, social interest, and initiation of peer interaction are usually unaffected.</li><li>Severe visual impairment — reduced or absent eye contact and shared attention (gaze switching or following a point), but normal imagination and play and no restricted interests or repetitive behaviours.</li><li>Selective mutism — there is usually a history of appropriate quality of communication and interaction in some circumstances, typically at home, where the child or young person usually talks normally.</li><li>Child maltreatment — children with a history of maltreatment can present with a marked change in behaviour which can be linked back to maltreatment. See the section on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/child-maltreatment-recognition-management/recognition/recognizing-child-maltreatment/\">Marked change in behavioural or emotional state</a> in the CKS topic <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/child-maltreatment-recognition-management/\">Child maltreatment -
