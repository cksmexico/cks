morphine).</li><li>Transmucosal opioids.</li><li>Subcutaneous opioids.</li><li>Intravenously infused opioids (if a central venous catheter is in place).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>When using opioids, titrate treatment to find the minimal effective dose that will relieve and prevent pain.</strong><ul><li>Calculate opioid doses for children using weight rather than age, because they may be underweight for their age.</li><li>Titrate treatment to provide continuous background analgesia, and prescribe additional doses for breakthrough pain if this occurs.</li><li>If treatment with a specific opioid does not give adequate pain relief or if it causes unacceptable side effects, consider an alternative opioid.</li></ul></li><li>In addition to background analgesia, consider giving anticipatory doses of analgesia for children who have pain at predictable times (for example when changing dressings, or when moving and handling).<ul><li>Do not include anticipatory doses when calculating the required daily background dose of analgesia.</li></ul></li><li><strong>If neuropathic pain is suspected and standard analgesia is not helping, consider a trial
