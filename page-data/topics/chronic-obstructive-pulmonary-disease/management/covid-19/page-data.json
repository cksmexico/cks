This includes those with COVID‑19, or who are suspected of having it.</li><li>Keep their self-management plan up to date and remind them that online video resources on correct inhaler technique are available.</li><li>At every interaction with a patient, be alert for new or increased issues with mental health and wellbeing, particularly anxiety and depression.</li><li>Find out if patients have advance care plans or advance decisions around ceilings of care, including 'do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation' decisions. Update the documentation as appropriate and share with the relevant agencies.</li><li>Encourage patients with more severe COPD who do not have advance care plans to develop one. Use decision support tools (when available) and refer to the Mental Capacity Act 2005 for patients who may lack capacity. It is likely that these discussions may need to take place remotely.</li><li>Document discussions and decisions clearly and take account of these in planning care.</li><li>Prescribe enough COPD medicines to meet the person’s clinical needs for no more than 30 days. For inhalers this will depend on the type of inhaler and the number of doses in the inhaler.</li></ul><h4>Corticosteroids</h4><ul><li>Explain to people that there is no evidence that treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) increases the risk associated with COVID‑19.</li><li>Advise those people who are using ICS regularly to continue to use them and delay any planned trials of withdrawal of ICS.</li><li>Advise people on long-term oral corticosteroids that they should continue to take them at their prescribed dose, because stopping them can be harmful.</li></ul><h4>Self-management for exacerbations</h4><ul><li>Advise people who think they are having an exacerbation that they should follow their individualised COPD self-management plan and start a course of oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics if clinically indicated.</li><li>Do not offer patients with COPD a short course of oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics to keep at home unless clinically indicated.</li><li>Advise people that they should not start a short course of oral corticosteroids and/or antibiotics for the known viral symptoms of COVID‑19, for example fever, dry cough, or myalgia.</li></ul><h4>Smoking cessation</h4><ul><li>Strongly encourage patients with COPD who are still smoking to stop, to reduce the risk of poor outcomes from COVID‑19 and their risk of acute exacerbations.</li></ul><h4>Pulmonary rehabilitation</h4><ul><li>Use online pulmonary rehabilitation resources, such as those available in the British Thoracic Society pulmonary rehabilitation resource pack, which covers self-management, home exercise, and educational materials.</li></ul><h4>Oxygen</h4><ul><li>Advise people currently receiving long-term oxygen therapy not to adjust their oxygen flow rate, unless advised to by their specialist.</li><li>Advise people currently receiving ambulatory oxygen not to start using it at rest or in their home, unless advised by their specialist team.</li></ul><h4>Oral prophylactic antibiotic therapy</h4><ul><li>Do not routinely start prophylactic antibiotics to reduce risk from COVID‑19.</li><li>Advise people already prescribed prophylactic antibiotics to continue taking them as prescribed, unless there is a new reason to stop treatment (for example, side effects or allergic reaction). This should be done in consultation with their specialist team.</li></ul><h4>Airway clearance</h4><ul><li>Advise people currently using airway clearance techniques to continue to do so.</li><li>Advise patients that inducing sputum is a potentially infectious aerosol-generating procedure, and they should take appropriate precautions such as:<ul><li>Performing airway clearance techniques in a well-ventilated room.</li><li>Performing airway clearance techniques away from other family members if possible.</li><li>Advising other family members not to enter the room until enough time has passed for aerosols to clear. A minimum of 20 minutes is considered pragmatic.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Equipment</h4><ul><li><strong>General advice</strong><ul><li>Advise people to wash their hands and clean equipment, such as face masks, mouthpieces, spacer devices and peak flow meters, regularly using washing-up liquid or following the manufacturer's cleaning instructions.</li><li>Advise people not to share their inhalers and devices with anyone else.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Nebulisers</strong><ul><li>Advise people that they can continue to use their nebuliser.</li><li>Do not offer nebulisers to patients unless clinically indicated.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Non-invasive ventilation</strong><ul><li>Advise patients currently receiving non-invasive ventilation at home that these are potentially infectious aerosol-generating procedures, and they should take appropriate precautions such as:<ul><li>Using equipment in a well-ventilated room.</li><li>Using equipment away from other family members if possible.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 81a1ac38-c475-4963-b819-ab9c00b96ac2 --><!-- end item f08c6043-173a-451f-b942-ab9c00b96ac2 -->","subChapters":[{"id":"a5340054-6fba-5ee8-b288-a76afd694a2f","slug":"basis-for-recommendation-40f","fullItemName":"Basis for recommendation","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field a72f9054-b39f-41e9-8717-ab9c00b96ac4 --><h4>Basis for recommendation</h4><!-- end field a72f9054-b39f-41e9-8717-ab9c00b96ac4 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 40f28e4f-6933-4428-9dc8-ab9c00b96ac4 --><!-- begin field df8643ea-bd40-46b3-91bd-ab9c00b96ac4 --><p>These recommendations are based on <em>COVID-19 rapid guideline: community-based care of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/references/\">NICE, 2020</a>].</p><p>The advice for people to continue with their regular self-management plan is to ensure that their COPD is as stable as possible.</p><p>The recommendation to only prescribe 30 days of medication is based on pragmatic advice from NICE as prescribing larger quantities of medicines will put the supply chain of medications at risk.</p><p>The recommendation to continue using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in COPD is based on NICE guidelines that advise that ‘there is some evidence that use of ICS in COPD may increase the overall risk of pneumonia this risk alone should not be used as a reason to change treatment in those established on ICS’ as this may cause a resultant risk and destabilisation of COPD management.</p><p>The recommendation on airway clearance and a 20-minute gap between the procedure and allowing family members back into the room is based on Public Health England <em>Transmission characteristics and principles of infection prevention and control</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/references/\">PHE, 2020</a>].</p><p>The recommendation that it is safe to continue using nebulisers is based on NICE guidance that states that in a nebuliser the aerosol comes from the fluid in the nebuliser chamber and does not carry virus particles from the patient.</p><!-- end field df8643ea-bd40-46b3-91bd-ab9c00b96ac4 --><!-- end item 40f28e4f-6933-4428-9dc8-ab9c00b96ac4 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
