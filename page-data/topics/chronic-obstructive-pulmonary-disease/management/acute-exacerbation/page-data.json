A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found hand-held inhalers with a spacer and nebulizers to be equally effective at alleviating symptoms. NICE acknowledged that in very breathless people, a nebulizer may be more appropriate.</li></ul><p><strong>Oral corticosteroids </strong>â clinical guidance from NICE, GOLD and the Lung Foundation Australia are in agreement on the use of oral corticosteroids in moderate to severe exacerbations of COPD.</p><ul><li>NICE identified three systematic reviews and one subsequent RCT of oral corticosteroids for COPD exacerbations, although they noted limitations to the validity and generalizability of several of the included studies. A significant effect on forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was demonstrated with oral corticosteroids compared with placebo with treatment duration of at least 3 days. Individual studies also found benefits in arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2). Findings on the effect on duration of hospitalization were inconsistent, and no difference in mortality was demonstrated. People taking corticosteroids were more likely to have adverse effects (for example hyperglycaemia).</li><li>As risks are associated with long-term corticosteroid use; identified evidence showed no benefit from taking corticosteroids for more than 7 days and shorter courses of 5 days are routinely used in clinical practice already the NICE guideline development group recommend a duration of treatment of 5 days. The 2019 guideline review did not look at corticosteroid doses â the dose from the original 2004 recommendation was retained.</li></ul><p><strong>Antibiotics</strong> â guidance from NICE, GOLD and the Lung Foundation Australia recommend that where an infective exacerbation of COPD is suspected (based on change in clinical features such as increased volume and change in colour and consistency of sputum) antibiotic therapy should be considered.</p><ul><li>The NICE guideline committee on antimicrobial prescribing in acute exacerbations of COPDÂ [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/references/\">NICE, 2018a</a>] agreed that:<ul><li>Many health professionals may not be aware of the limited benefit of antibiotics, and that many exacerbations are not caused by a bacterial infection.</li><li>It was not possible to identify which people with an acute exacerbation are more likely to benefit from antibiotics.
