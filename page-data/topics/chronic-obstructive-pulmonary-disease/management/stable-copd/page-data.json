inhaler (and spacer where appropriate).<ul><li>Appropriate training is required to ensure adequate inhaler technique â€” repeated checks at follow up are also essential as poor technique, even after training, is common.</li><li>Assessment of inhaler technique and adherence to treatment should be carried out before concluding that a specific therapy is ineffective.</li></ul></li><li>Choice of

particular inhaler correctly or it is unsuitable for them provide an alternative.</li><li>Minimise the number and type of inhalers used by each person as much as possible â€” specifying the brand and inhaler in prescriptions will help ensure the person receives the same device each time.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Spacers</h5><ul><li>Spacers are plastic devices with a mouthpiece at one end and a hole for a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) to be inserted at the other:<ul><li>They require less coordination than use of a MDI alone and allow carers to help people with cognitive impairment or functional problems.</li><li>They slow down the particles of the drug and allow more time for evaporation of the propellant, so that more of the drug can be inhaled.</li><li>They increase the proportion of the drug delivered to the airways and reduce the amount of drug deposited in the oropharynx (thereby reducing local adverse effects and systemic absorption).</li><li>They are useful in people with poor inhalation technique.</li></ul></li><li>Provide a spacer that is compatible with the person's metered-dose inhaler â€“ spacers are not interchangeable and must be compatible with the MDI used.</li><li>Advise people to use a spacer with a MDI metered-dose inhaler in the following way:<ul><li>Administer the drug by single actuations of the metered-dose inhaler into the spacer, inhaling after each actuation.</li><li>There should be minimal delay between inhaler actuation and inhalation.</li><li>Normal tidal breathing can be used as it is as effective as single breaths.</li><li>Repeat if a second dose is required.</li></ul></li><li>Advise people on spacer cleaning:<ul><li>Do not clean the spacer more than monthly, because more frequent cleaning affects their performance (because of a build-up of static).</li><li>Hand wash using warm water and washing-up liquid, and allow the spacer to air dry.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Nebulisers</h5><ul><li>Consider nebuliser therapy for people
