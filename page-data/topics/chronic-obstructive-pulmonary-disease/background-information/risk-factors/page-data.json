smoking</strong><ul><li>Cigarette smoking is the most common risk factor for COPD.</li><li>About 90% of cases are associated with cigarette smoking — the risk of COPD (compared to non-smokers) is also increased with pipe, cigar, water pipe, and marijuana smoking.</li><li>Passive smoking may also contribute to development of COPD.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Occupational exposure</strong><ul><li>Occupational exposures to dusts (such as coal, grains and silica), and certain fumes or chemicals (such as welding fume, isocyanates, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) have been associated with development of COPD.</li><li>About 20% of diagnosed cases of COPD are associated with occupational exposure — in lifelong non-smokers, this increases to 30%.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Air pollution</strong><ul><li>Exposure to high levels of indoor air pollutants from burning wood and other biomass materials (such as coal) have been associated with increased risk of COPD.</li><li>The role of outdoor pollutants in development of COPD is not clear.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Genetics</strong><ul><li>Less common risk factors for development of COPD include genetic abnormalities such as alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.</li><li>Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency typically presents in younger people (aged less than 45 years) and affects both smokers and non-smokers.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Lung development</strong><ul><li>Factors affecting lung growth and development in-utero (such as maternal smoking and pre-term birth) and in childhood (such as severe respiratory tract infection and passive smoking) have been associated with reduced lung function and potentially increased risk of COPD in adulthood.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Asthma</strong><ul><li>Asthma may be a risk factor for development of COPD – one longitudinal cohort study (Tucson Epidemiological Study of Airway Obstructive Disease) found that after adjusting for smoking, adults with asthma had a 12 fold higher risk of developing COPD compared to those without asthma.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a
