It found urea breath tests to be consistently accurate with about 95% sensitivity and specificity reported in studies.</li><li>PHE and consensus opinion in the Maastricht V/Florence Consensus Report also recommends the urea breath test for re-testing, but states that the stool antigen test is an alternative option if the carbon-13 urea breath test is unavailable, and that re-testing should be performed at least 4–8 weeks after completion of <em>H. pylori</em> eradication therapy.</li><li>Serological testing cannot differentiate active infection from previous infection, resulting in an at-least two-fold false positive rate compared with urea breath tests and stool antigen tests [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-peptic-ulcer/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>]. This may result in potential over-treatment with eradication regimens and associated increased costs of treatment and increased antibiotic resistance rates [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-peptic-ulcer/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-peptic-ulcer/references/\">Malfertheiner, 2017</a>].</li><li>CKS notes that people with a proven gastric ulcer should have a repeat endoscopy performed at 6–8 weeks after starting drug treatment, and <em>H. pylori</em> re-testing may be performed at the same time as the endoscopic procedure.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Offering second-line <em>H. pylori</em> eradication therapy</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on second-line <em>H. pylori</em> eradication regimens are largely based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-peptic-ulcer/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>] and the PHE publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-peptic-ulcer/references/\">PHE, 2016</a>].<ul><li>NICE found that the cost-effectiveness of each regimen was driven by its clinical effectiveness at eradicating <em>H. pylori</em>, and regimens containing at least two antibiotics were more cost-effective than PPI monotherapy or dual therapy with a PPI and one antibiotic.<ul><li>A network meta-analysis of low- to very-low quality evidence showed there were some differences between triple and quadruple drug regimens, but it was not possible to confidently determine the best eradication regimen.</li><li>There was no evidence that extending eradication treatment beyond 7 days increased the efficacy of the regimen, and a 7-day regimen may improve medication adherence compared with longer durations of treatment.</li><li>NICE highlighted the importance of assessing the person's previous antibiotic exposure, particularly to clarithromycin and metronidazole, as <em>H. pylori</em> may become resistant after limited exposure, resulting in reduced efficacy of these drugs if used in future regimens.</li><li>NICE noted that the evidence for second-line regimens came from studies conducted outside northern Europe, which may limit their applicability to the UK population.</li></ul></li><li>PHE also highlights the need to check for recent quinolone use, as repeated use of this antibiotic can also increase the risk of antibiotic resistance.<ul><li>CKS notes that PHE recommend a 10-day course of two second-line treatment regimens, so CKS recommends 7–10 days of treatment to incorporate both NICE and PHE recommendations.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h5>Offering PPI or histamine (H<sub>2</sub>)-receptor antagonist (H<sub>2</sub>RA) therapy if ongoing symptoms</h5><ul><li>The recommendation on offering acid suppression therapy if there are refractory or recurrent symptoms is based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-peptic-ulcer/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>] and the PHE publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-peptic-ulcer/references/\">PHE, 2016</a>].<ul><li>Limited evidence from short-term trials showed that both PPIs and H<sub>2</sub>RAs can reduce dyspepsia symptoms, although the evidence supporting PPI use was stronger. There were, however, methodological limitations which affected the interpretation of results.</li><li>NICE recommends the use of low-dose PPIs first-line on the basis of the trial evidence, that found full-dose PPIs were no more effective in reducing dyspepsia symptoms.</li><li>The recommendation to consider switching to an alternative acid suppression therapy is extrapolated from the NICE clinical guideline recommendations to offer an H<sub>2</sub>RA if there is an inadequate response to a PPI for people with uninvestigated dyspepsia, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), or recurrent dyspepsia after healing of peptic ulcer disease, as individual people may respond better to H<sub>2</sub>RA therapy. This is supported by the expert opinion of previous external reviewers of this CKS topic.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Stepping down or stopping treatment</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on stepping down or stopping acid suppression treatment are based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-peptic-ulcer/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>].<ul><li>The recommendation on using the lowest effective PPI dose to control symptoms is to reduce the risks of adverse effects associated with long-term PPI use, and is considered a more cost-effective option than continuous PPI use.</li><li>The recommendation to use a PPI as needed, if possible, is extrapolated from evidence on the management of people with endoscopy-negative reflux disease that found this is a cost-effective option to promote patient self-management of their condition.</li><li>The recommendation on self-treating with antacid and/or alginate therapy is extrapolated from NICE recommendations on the management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).<ul><li>NICE noted that antacid and/or alginate medication is often prescribed by primary healthcare professionals, and is often used as over-the-counter medication. It may provide short-term symptom relief, but does not prevent dyspepsia symptoms.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h5>Arranging specialist referral</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on arranging referral to a gastroenterologist for a specialist opinion are largely based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-peptic-ulcer/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>], the PHE publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-peptic-ulcer/references/\">PHE, 2016</a>], and a Cochrane systematic review [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-peptic-ulcer/references/\">Gurusamy, 2016</a>].<ul><li>People with recurrent or refractory symptoms despite optimal management in primary care may need repeat endoscopy or other specialist investigations to rule out refractory peptic ulcer disease, ulcers with non-peptic aetiologies, or occult upper intestinal malignancy.</li><li>PHE states that third-line <em>H. pylori</em> eradication should only be offered on the advice of a specialist, and recommends referral if there are limited antibiotic options to use for <em>H. pylori</em> eradication therapy.</li><li>Surgical treatments for refractory peptic ulcer disease include antrectomy with a gastro-duodenal anastomosis or gastro-jejunal anastomosis, a vagotomy and pyloroplasty, or a highly-selective vagotomy. The NICE clinical guideline notes, however, that this surgery is now rarely performed.<ul><li>A Cochrane systematic review of people with recurrent or refractory peptic ulcer disease found a lack of evidence for the relative benefits of medical compared with surgical treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-peptic-ulcer/references/\">Gurusamy, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 433965eb-3cb5-44be-bee7-a7600144294d --><!-- end item 01ff91c7-51f5-4a79-ae64-a7600144294d -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
