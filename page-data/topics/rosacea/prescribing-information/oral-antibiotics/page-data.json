Aminophylline is predicted to increase the risk of hypokalaemia when given with erythromycin.</li><li>Amiodarone — both amiodarone and erythromycin prolong the QT interval. Manufacturer advises to avoid concurrent use.</li><li>Theophylline — erythromycin increases plasma concentrations of theophylline, and theophylline may also reduce absorption of erythromycin. Check theophylline levels 48 hours after starting erythromycin, and adjust the dose of theophylline accordingly.</li><li>Carbamazepine — erythromycin inhibits the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4, resulting in reduced carbamazepine metabolism. Advise the person to report symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity (such as dizziness, diplopia, ataxia, or confusion).</li><li>Digoxin — erythromycin increases the concentration of digoxin. Manufacturer advises to monitor digoxin concentration.</li><li>Rivaroxaban — erythromycin may increase levels of rivaroxaban, increasing the risk of bleeding. </li><li>Warfarin — occasionally and unpredictably, the effects of warfarin may be markedly increased by macrolides. Monitor the international normalized ratio (INR), and adjust the warfarin dose accordingly.</li><li>Statins — there is an increased risk of myopathy (due to cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 inhibition) if erythromycin is taken with atorvastatin or simvastatin.<ul><li>For simvastatin — do not prescribe erythromycin to a person taking simvastatin, as simvastatin is extensively metabolized by CYP3A4. If treatment with erythromycin cannot be avoided, stop treatment with simvastatin during the course of treatment.</li><li>For atorvastatin — avoid concurrent use with erythromycin, as atorvastatin is moderately metabolized by CYP3A4. If concurrent use cannot be avoided, prescribe the lowest starting dose of atorvastatin (10 mg), and advise the person to report any muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness.</li><li>Other statins — clinically significant drug interactions resulting from cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism are not expected for rosuvastatin and pravastatin as they are not metabolized to a clinically significant extent by the cytochrome P450 system. Fluvastatin is not dependent on CYP3A metabolism; therefore, interaction with erythromycin is unlikely. Nevertheless, advise the person to report any muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Drugs that prolong the QT interval (such as amisulpride, citalopram, escitalopram, domperidone, fluconazole, haloperidol, hydroxyzine, lithium, ondansetron, risperidone, sildenafil, sotalol, tolterodine, terfenadine, and venlafaxine) — all macrolides can prolong the QT interval, and concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval is not recommended. Seek advice from a microbiologist regarding a suitable alternative antibiotic.</li><li>Drugs that cause hypokalaemia (such as diuretics, corticosteroids, short-acting beta-2 agonists) — hypokalaemia is a risk factor for QT prolongation. Seek advice from a microbiologist regarding a suitable alternative antibiotic.</li><li>Calcium-channel blockers — owing to an increased risk of hypotension, caution is advised with the concurrent use of macrolides and calcium-channel blocker's metabolised by CYP3A4 (such as verapamil, amlodipine, and diltiazem).</li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/rosacea/references/\">Joint Formulary Committee, 2020</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/rosacea/references/\">MHRA, 2020</a>]</p><!-- end field e7eb1c2d-261a-4ca6-ad03-365dc3426b21 --><!-- end item 4910040f-c628-4d2e-8929-cb4e42920adc -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
