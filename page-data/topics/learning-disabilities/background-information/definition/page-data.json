The WHO classifies severity of an intellectual disability as:</strong><ul><li>Mild — Approximate IQ range of 50 to 69 (in adults, mental age from 9 to under 12 years). Likely to result in some learning difficulties in school. Many adults will be able to work and maintain good social relationships and contribute to society.</li><li>Moderate — Approximate IQ range of 35 to 49 (in adults, mental age from 6 to under 9 years). Likely to result in marked developmental delays in childhood but most can learn to develop some degree of independence in self-care and acquire adequate communication and academic skills. Adults will need varying degrees of support to live and work in the community.</li><li>Severe — Approximate IQ range of 20 to 34 (in adults, mental age from 3 to under 6 years). Likely to result in continuous need of support.</li><li>Profound — IQ under 20 (in adults, mental age below 3 years). Results in severe limitation in self-care, continence, communication and mobility.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/learning-disabilities/references/\">WHO, 1992</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/learning-disabilities/references/\">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/learning-disabilities/references/\">NICE, 2015a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/learning-disabilities/references/\">Mental Health Foundation, 2018</a>]</p><!-- end field 51b6268d-be21-4013-a22c-a97300c95a48 --><!-- end item 47e34c52-6d40-4aeb-806e-a97300c958ab -->","topic":{"id":"81b6bf13-1851-5aca-a415-deb2664fff5b","topicId":"9cc09e0b-a51c-445a-a0f0-a8e200bd3e76","topicName":"Learning disabilities","slug":"learning-disabilities","lastRevised":"Last revised in August 2020","chapters":[{"id":"433a4d95-fb0e-597f-886b-7a5bba677e2e","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"e6952a3b-5351-51c3-b34d-3ce4fd90e136","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"cd675bbe-842b-5eac-9101-92f52a07ffd0","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"42e6170c-2ad4-5c42-98b5-66bb0f315b56","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"cdef379f-d2ef-5c80-9644-6e1cb6864f2a","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"f8ff91d6-3a99-5f81-ab3e-b522150de1f1","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"dbf4d83d-021c-5c6c-8be4-5637c384ed7b","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"73bb96cd-3d7f-50c7-8bd6-2c3f50a56d70","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"4e9fbda8-d558-51be-9f50-16e404570513","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"8a99509d-dcc3-52cf-be04-85ee2c4aad00","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"88e8dc33-8096-57aa-accc-3ec205effbe3","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP - Options for local implementation"},{"id":"b9a8bf11-ca0b-51a0-a965-d5058c0bceca","slug":"nice-quality-standards","fullItemName":"NICE quality standards"}]},{"id":"40e1752f-d69e-5ab7-9d4a-751e3289532f","fullItemName":"Background information","slug":"background-information","subChapters":[{"id":"f13e3735-ce06-52c4-a330-2ed80d3bd1db","slug":"definition","fullItemName":"Definition"},{"id":"e2c46c5d-8972-5934-9c2a-7e6a370aaf81","slug":"prevalence","fullItemName":"Prevalence"},{"id":"432f94cd-ae01-5de8-aedc-0b0ca066f01b","slug":"risk-factors","fullItemName":"Risk factors"},{"id":"6d615282-75db-51f0-a502-caab96337165","slug":"complications-prognosis","fullItemName":"Complications and prognosis"}]},{"id":"3e168af4-366c-5883-b8e2-f10a900203b9","fullItemName":"Diagnosis","slug":"diagnosis","subChapters":[{"id":"6f93bf68-ee6a-5cca-945c-edac36347b11","slug":"diagnosis","fullItemName":"Diagnosis"}]},{"id":"1023b7ee-da44-5608-93e7-0d0361e2bdbe","fullItemName":"Management","slug":"management","subChapters":[{"id":"63437873-b64a-5f3b-9349-73033c126cc9","slug":"suspected-learning-disability","fullItemName":"Scenario: Suspected learning disability"},{"id":"cde5b7a3-65e9-5519-8ba3-6f28c1edf1ee","slug":"confirmed-learning-disability","fullItemName":"Scenario: Confirmed learning disability"},{"id":"658ba274-21c6-574b-b7a8-81d968ca5702","slug":"behaviour-that-challenges-mental-health-problems","fullItemName":"Scenario: Behaviour that challenges and mental health problems"}]},{"id":"7c2b476c-d197-54fe-90d2-7ed4ec49e103","fullItemName":"Supporting evidence","slug":"supporting-evidence","subChapters":[]},{"id":"5d7ee2c8-572a-5444-bbdc-b66f157b7c7d","fullItemName":"How this topic was developed","slug":"how-this-topic-was-developed","subChapters":[{"id":"4fa0c0b5-be1f-57f2-958e-597ba3d36eba","slug":"search-strategy","fullItemName":"Search strategy"},{"id":"257eba34-aad1-5a9b-92b8-65f0ed224fb3","slug":"stakeholder-engagement","fullItemName":"Stakeholder engagement"},{"id":"99791e8d-d65b-573e-8907-07ff851cb6a2","slug":"evidence-exclusion-criteria","fullItemName":"Evidence exclusion criteria"},{"id":"c31529b2-263b-541e-833e-2926c92f7847","slug":"organizational-behavioural-financial-barriers","fullItemName":"Organizational, behavioural and financial barriers"},{"id":"fa2e8dd7-1128-5824-b391-29a2ade6d4f5","slug":"declarations-of-interest","fullItemName":"Declarations of interest"}]},{"id":"e3a9941b-b74a-59c0-8bf5-66ce8ec74f4f","fullItemName":"References","slug":"references","subChapters":[]}]},"parentChapter":{"id":"40e1752f-d69e-5ab7-9d4a-751e3289532f","slug":"background-information","fullItemName":"Background information"},"subChapters":[]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
