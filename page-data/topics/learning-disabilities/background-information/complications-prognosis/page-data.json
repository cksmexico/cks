This occurs at rates of around 5–15% in educational, health, or social care services and 30–40% in hospital settings, and can encompass:</strong><ul><li>Aggression.</li><li>Self-injury.</li><li>Stereotypic behaviour — this can encompass stereotypies, rituals, compulsions, obsessions, perseveration, and repetitive or stereotyped use of language.</li><li>Withdrawal. </li><li>Disruptive or destructive behaviour, which can include violence, arson, or sexual abuse, and may bring the person into contact with the criminal justice system.</li><li>The risk of 'behaviour that challenges' is increased by factors including:<ul><li>A severe learning disability.</li><li>Autism spectrum disorder.</li><li>Dementia.</li><li>Communication difficulties (expressive and receptive).</li><li>Visual impairment (which may lead to increased self-injury and stereotypy).</li><li>Physical health problems.</li><li>Age (incidence peaks in the teens and twenties).</li><li>Abusive or restrictive social environments.</li><li>Environments with little or too much sensory stimulation and those with low engagement levels.</li><li>Developmentally inappropriate environments (for example, a curriculum that makes too many demands on a child or young person).</li><li>Environments where disrespectful social relationships and poor communication are typical or where staff do not have the capacity or resources to respond to people's needs.</li><li>Changes to the person's environment (for example, significant staff changes or moving to a new care setting).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Physical health complications —</strong> <strong>around 50% of people with learning disabilities have a comorbid physical health condition. This is thought to be due to a combination of factors, including:</strong><ul><li>Increased rates of obesity and of being underweight due to dietary factors, lack of physical exercise, and difficulties accessing healthy lifestyle advice and support.</li><li>A 20-fold increased risk of epilepsy compared to background population rates.</li><li>Increased risk of dysphagia leading to eating and drinking problems and aspiration pneumonia.</li><li>Increased rates of visual and hearing impairment.</li><li>Increased rates of constipation, dyspepsia, thyroid disorders, eczema, and Parkinson's disease or Parkinsonism compared to background population rates.</li><li>Difficulties accessing healthcare and communicating needs.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Mental health problems — in the UK, mental health problems are experienced by 40% (or 28% if problem behaviours are excluded) of adults and around 36% (or 24% if problem behaviours are excluded) of children and young people with learning disabilities. These can include:</strong><ul><li>Anxiety.</li><li>Depression.</li><li>Phobias.</li><li>Psychosis.</li><li>Bipolar Disorder.</li><li>Schizophrenia.</li><li>Dementia — rate of 22% compared to 6% in the general population.<ul><li>Dementia is particularly prevalent in people with Down's syndrome with an earlier onset than in the general population. The prevalence is 10-22% in those aged 40-50 years, 20- 25% in those aged 50 to 60 years, and 40-77% in those aged over 60 years, contributing to one third of deaths.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Social inequality — in the UK, a person with a learning disability is more likely than a person in the background population to:</strong><ul><li>Live in housing that is rented and/or overcrowded and/or of a poor standard — around 60% of children and young people with learning disabilities live in poverty.</li><li>Be exposed to tobacco smoke.</li><li>Be bullied and/or physically, sexually, or emotionally abused — children with a learning disability are often socially excluded and 8 out of 10 are bullied.</li><li>Have less social support.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Premature death </strong>— a 2012 confidential enquiry based on data from 142 males and 105 females found that men with a learning disability died on average 13 years sooner than men in the background population, while women died 20 years sooner than the female population average.<ul><li>Conditions associated with a learning disability (such as epilepsy, aspiration pneumonia, chromosomal disorders and associated congenital heart problems) can increase the risk of premature death.</li><li>A higher risk of inadequate or inappropriate care may also be a contributory factor to the increased mortality risk.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/learning-disabilities/references/\">Watt et al, 2008</a>;
