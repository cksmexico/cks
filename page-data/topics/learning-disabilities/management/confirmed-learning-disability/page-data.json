Tell them about, and/or help them access screening services, testicular and prostate checks, dental checks, hearing and sight tests, and podiatry. Discuss changes that may occur with age. Note: where possible, primary care services should aim to ensure that older people with learning disabilities can see the same GP and other healthcare practitioners, to help practitioners: become familiar with the person's medical history, build good relationships and understand the person's usual behaviour and communication needs.</li><li>Providing information about other available services, including a care and support assessment under the Care Act 2014 if they have not already had one.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Be aware that people with specific syndromes may require tailored and/or additional health assessments. </strong>For example, adults with Down's syndrome should receive assessment during their annual health check of changes that might suggest the onset of dementia, such as any change in the person's behaviour, loss of skills (including self-care), or need for more prompting in the past few months.

This is particularly important if the person has difficulty communicating.</li><li>Any third parties who the person would like to involve in creating their end of life plan are recognised. The person should be asked regularly who they would like to involve in discussions about their end of life plan, in case they change their mind. </li><li>The person dies in their preferred location.</li><li>Family members and carers have been provided (where appropriate) with training, information, and support for example, in medication, pain, nutrition and hydration, to enable the person to die in their preferred location,</li><li>Key members of the person's support network have the knowledge, confidence and understanding to communicate with the person about their illness and death.
