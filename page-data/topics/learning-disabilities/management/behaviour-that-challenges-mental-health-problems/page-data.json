This behaviour often results from the interaction between personal and environmental factors and includes aggression, self-injury, stereotypic behaviour, withdrawal, and disruptive or destructive behaviour. It can also include violence, arson or sexual abuse, and may bring the person into contact with the criminal justice system.</li><li><strong>If a child, young person, or adult with a learning disability presents in primary care with 'behaviour that challenges', or a suspected mental health problem (see below), take into account the severity of the person's learning disability, their developmental stage, and any communication difficulties or physical or mental health problems during all stages of management.

This may be via the learning disability support team or a direct referral, depending on local availability. </strong></li><li><strong>Where serious mental illness or dementia are suspected, the person should be referred directly to a psychiatrist with expertise in assessing and treating mental health problems in people with learning disabilities. For further general information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/dementia/\">Dementia</a>.</strong></li><li><strong>The person should be offered interventions in-line with the relevant guidelines for their diagnosed condition.</strong> Where this is being managed in primary care (often in collaboration with other healthcare professionals involved in assessment and management), discuss the treatment options with the person and provide information in a format and language suited to their needs, including:<ul><li>The purpose of treatment.</li><li>Potential side effects or disadvantages.</li><li>Potential benefits.</li><li>Outcome measures.<ul><li>Address any queries or concerns that the person may have at any stage.</li><li>Allow enough time for the person to make an informed choice if they have decision-making capacity. If they do not, provide enough time for their family members, carers, or care workers to contribute fully.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>When considering treatment options:</strong><ul><li>Cognitive behavioural therapy, adapted for people with learning disabilities can be considered to treat depression or subthreshold depressive symptoms in people with milder learning disabilities.</li><li>Relaxation therapy can be considered to treat anxiety symptoms in people with learning disabilities.</li><li>Graded exposure techniques can be considered to treat anxiety symptoms or phobias in people with learning disabilities.</li><li>Parent training programmes specifically designed for parents or carers of children with learning disabilities can be considered to help prevent or treat mental health problems in the child, and to support carer wellbeing.</li><li>The nature, content, and delivery of any interventions should be adjusted to take into account the impact of the person's learning disability and 'behaviour that challenges'. Ensure that the person understands the purpose, plan and content of any intervention before it starts, and regularly throughout.</li></ul></li><li><strong>If prescribing medication:</strong><ul><li>Be aware that only primary care practitioners with training/expertise in the care of people with a learning disability should initiate treatment with psychotropic drugs. Additionally, specialists with expertise in treating mental health problems in people with learning disabilities should start medication in adults with more severe learning disabilities (unless there are locally agreed protocols for shared care) and children and young people with any learning disabilities.</li><li>Do <em>not </em>initiate antipsychotic medication in primary care. This should initially be prescribed and monitored by a specialist (an adult or child psychiatrist or a neurodevelopmental paediatrician) and may later be transferred to primary care as part of a shared care arrangement.</li><li>Take into account factors including potential medication interactions, the possible impact of medication on other health conditions, the risk of non-adherence, and any required monitoring (for example, blood tests). When necessary, consult with specialists (for example, neurologists providing epilepsy care when prescribing antipsychotic medication that may lower the seizure threshold), to minimise possible interactions. Agree monitoring responsibilities, including whether it may be appropriate for another healthcare professional such as a learning disability nurse to carry out any necessary blood tests.</li><li>Monitor and review the benefits and possible harms or side effects, using agreed outcome measures and taking into account communication needs. Use the timescales given in the relevant guideline for the specific disorder to inform the review, and adjust it to the person's needs.</li><li>Aim for the lowest effective dose. Take account of both potential side-effects and difficulties the person may have in reporting them, and the need to avoid sub-therapeutic doses that may not treat the mental health problem effectively.</li><li>Record a summary of the information that  was provided about the prescribed medication, including side-effects, to the person and their family members, carers, or care workers, when the medication will be reviewed, plans for reducing or discontinuing the medication, and if appropriate, full details of all medication the person is taking, including the doses, frequency, and purpose.</li><li>When switching medication, pay particular attention to discontinuation or interaction effects that may occur during titration. Only change one drug at a time, to make it easier to identify these effects.</li><li>For further information, see the CKS topics on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/bipolar-disorder/\">Bipolar disorder</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression/\">Depression</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-in-children/\">Depression in children</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/generalized-anxiety-disorder/\">Generalized anxiety disorder</a>, and <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/psychosis-schizophrenia/\">Psychosis and schizophrenia</a>.</li><li>If there is any uncertainty, seek specialist advice.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 5407945f-1599-4ce2-9f75-a97d01468937 --><!-- end item 61ceb740-dfca-4e41-b2de-a97d01468937 -->","subChapters":[{"id":"60af0960-22f6-51e6-946c-6e42f6b47ba0","slug":"basis-for-recommendation-b59","fullItemName":"Basis for recommendation","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field fd3507d4-bdb0-431c-ad9b-a97d01468938 --><h4>Basis for recommendation</h4><!-- end field fd3507d4-bdb0-431c-ad9b-a97d01468938 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item b59a96f8-7636-4920-91fb-a97d01468938 --><!-- begin field 6cb40f7e-abda-4089-9a58-a97d01468938 --><p>The recommendations on management of a person with learning difficulties with 'behaviour that challenges' and/or a mental health problem are based on expert opinion in the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines <em>Challenging behaviour and learning disabilities: prevention and interventions for people with learning disabilities whose behaviour challenges</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/learning-disabilities/references/\">NICE, 2015a</a>] and <em>Mental health problems in people with learning disabilities: prevention, assessment and management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/learning-disabilities/references/\">NICE, 2016a</a>].</p><h5>Psychotropic drug prescribing in primary care</h5><ul><li>The recommendation that primary care management of mental health problems in a person with a learning difficulty should involve practitioners with appropriate training/expertise in learning disabilities is based on expert opinion in the Royal College of Psychiatrists practice guideline <em>Psychotropic drug prescribing for people with intellectual disability, mental health problems and/or behaviours that challenge</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/learning-disabilities/references/\">Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2016</a>] which states that 'all initiations of psychotropic drugs for people with intellectual disability, whether from primary or secondary care, should be by a prescriber who is competent in the care of people with intellectual disability'.</li></ul><!-- end field 6cb40f7e-abda-4089-9a58-a97d01468938 --><!-- end item b59a96f8-7636-4920-91fb-a97d01468938 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
