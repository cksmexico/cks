This may be based on neurodevelopmental assessment, and/or on a pre-existing condition for which some degree of learning disability is a component (such as Down's syndrome). In rare cases, children or adults may present in primary care with a <em>suspected</em> learning disability. In such cases:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Take a history, bearing in mind the person's communication needs and level of understanding. Wherever possible/appropriate, speak to the person directly rather than talking about or over them, and note factors such as eye contact, use of vocabulary, and social interaction.</strong> <strong>When interacting with a person with a suspected learning disability:</strong><ul><li>Use clear, straightforward and unambiguous language.</li><li>Assess whether communication aids, an advocate, or someone familiar with the person's communication methods are needed.</li><li>Make adjustments to accommodate sensory impairments (including sight and hearing impairments).</li><li>Use concrete examples, visual imagery, practical demonstrations, and role play to explain concepts.</li><li>Communicate at a pace that is comfortable for the person.</li><li>Use different methods and formats for communication (written, signing, visual, verbal, where possible), depending on the person's preferences.</li><li>Regularly check the person's understanding.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Ask the person or their parent/carer about:</strong><ul><li>The person's past or current behaviour and difficulties with daily living such as budgeting, planning, time management, understanding complex information, and time taken to learn new skills.</li><li>Family and social history.</li><li>Developmental history (birth, pregnancy, developmental milestones).</li><li>Health problems as a child.</li><li>Input from other professionals, both as a child and as an adult.</li><li>Educational history (types of schools, level of help and support required, statements of special educational needs).</li><li>Occupational history (both paid and voluntary).</li><li>Medical history (physical and psychological difficulties, head injury, epilepsy).</li><li>Mental health issues.</li><li>History of emotional care and support (including known attachment difficulties, significant bereavements).</li><li>Family/carer interpretations of the person’s difficulties.</li><li>Previous cognitive assessments.</li><li>Current medication.</li><li>Vision and hearing.</li><li>Motor difficulties.</li></ul></li><li><strong>In addition to evidence of impairment of intellectual and social functioning which arose before adulthood, factors that may raise the index of suspicion for a learning disability include:</strong><ul><li>Some chromosomal and genetic anomalies — such as Down's syndrome, William's syndrome, Rhett syndrome, fragile X syndrome.</li><li>Some non-genetic congenital malformations — such as some types of spina bifida, hydrocephalus, microcephaly.</li><li>Prenatal exposures — including alcohol, sodium valproate, congenital rubella infection, zika virus.</li><li>Birth complications that may have resulted in hypoxic brain injury/cerebral palsy.</li><li>Extreme prematurity (usually <33 weeks' gestation).</li><li>Childhood illness — such as meningitis, encephalitis, measles.</li><li>Childhood brain injury caused by accident/physical abuse.</li><li>Childhood neglect and/or lack of stimulation in early life.</li><li>Some neurodevelopmental disorders — autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be associated with a learning disability. For information on the diagnosis and management of ASD and ADHD, please see the CKS topics on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/autism-in-children/\">Autism in children</a> and <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/\">Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Assess the level of learning disability (note: it is likely that those beyond infancy presenting with a <em>suspected </em>learning disability in primary care will be at the milder end of the spectrum):</strong><ul><li>People with milder learning disabilities may be able to live independently and care for themselves, manage everyday tasks, work in paid employment, communicate their needs and wishes, have some language skills, may have additional needs that are not clear to people who do not know them well.</li><li>People with more severe learning disabilities are more likely to need support with daily activities such as dressing, washing, food preparation, and keeping themselves safe, have limited or no verbal communication skills or understanding of others, need support with mobility, have complex health needs and sensory impairments.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 3cc84286-346f-47e6-8986-a8e200bd4669 --><!-- end item e5510949-d0cc-4eed-b009-a8e200bd4669
