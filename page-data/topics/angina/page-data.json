For most people this will be low-dose aspirin (75 mg daily).</li><li>An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor should be prescribed for people with coexisting hypertension, heart failure, asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, chronic kidney disease, or previous myocardial infarction in line with current guidance, unless this is contraindicated or not tolerated.
