The mucocutaneous lesions appear 1–2 days after a prodromal period of fever, malaise, and myalgia; and last approximately 7–10 days with spontaneous resolution.</li><li><strong>HFMD is caused by enteroviruses from the picornavirus family </strong>(small, non-enveloped, single stranded RNA viruses).
