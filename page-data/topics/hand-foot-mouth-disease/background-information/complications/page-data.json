The mortality rate in complicated cases is cited as 10–25.7%.</li><li>Case reports have described miscarriage, stillbirth, congenital malformation, intrauterine growth restriction, and hydrops fetalis following HFMD in pregnancy. However, causality is not proven and a small retrospective cohort study of pregnant women with HFMD (n = 53) reported rates of miscarriage and congenital malformation within expected background rates. The World Health Organization and NHS state that there is no clear evidence of fetal risk.</li><li>HFMD acquired around the time of delivery can lead to neonatal infection. This is mostly mild and self-limiting, however, neonatal complications including severe hepatic, respiratory, and neurological disease have been documented. Reassuringly, none of these appear to have been associated with the most common Coxsackie A16 strain.</li></ul></li></ul><p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hand-foot-mouth-disease/references/\">WHO, 2012</a>;
