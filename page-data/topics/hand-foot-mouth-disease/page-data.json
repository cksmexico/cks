It should not be confused with foot and mouth disease of animals, which is caused by a different virus.</li><li>HFMD is usually mild and self-limiting. </li><li>It is most commonly due to Coxsackie A16 virus, although other group A and B Coxsackie viruses may be causative. Less commonly, but more seriously, it can be caused by enterovirus 71. </li><li>Atypical HFMD has been described, which is caused by the Coxsackie virus A6 and presents with a more widespread and extensive skin disease, nail shedding, and a higher risk for adult infection.</li><li>Outbreaks occur frequently among groups of children in nurseries, childcare centres, and schools. Spread within families is common. Most adults are immune following previous exposure during childhood, however, adult cases can occur.</li><li>Complications of HFMD are rare.</li><ul><li>Dehydration is the most common complication, due to oral pain interfering with intake of fluids.</li><li>Secondary bacterial infection of lesions can occur.</li><li>Rare, serious life-threatening neurological sequelae include encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, and acute flaccid paralysis.</li></ul><li>The diagnosis is usually clinical, based on symptoms and signs.</li><ul><li>Early symptoms are fever (typically 38–39°C), malaise, loss of appetite, cough, abdominal pain, and sore mouth.</li><li>Scattered ulcerative lesions of the oral cavity occur within 1–2 days.</li><li>Macules and papules of the hands and feet usually develop soon after the oral lesions. The sides of the fingers, dorsum of the hands, and margins of the heels are more frequently affected than the palms or soles.</li></ul><li>Management includes:</li><ul><li>Advice to drink fluids and eat a soft diet if mouth ulcers are painful.</li><li>Pain relief with simple analgesia such as paracetamol and ibuprofen.</li></ul><li>To minimize transmission:</li><ul><li>Advice should be offered on general hygiene measures.</li><li>Children do not need to be excluded from nursery, childcare, or school for infection control. Exclusion is only necessary if the child is too unwell to attend.</li></ul><li>Ideally, pregnant women should avoid close contact with anyone with HFMD and follow advice to minimize the risk of transmission, especially around the time of delivery. Specialist advice should be sought if delivery is expected within 3 weeks.</li></ul><!-- end field c60f7ad3-0320-47a9-8342-efae5b7f0bdc --><!-- end item 63191fc4-ec10-4c0c-8a1c-1e6dd33d863e -->","topic":{"id":"b789997c-d058-5604-a37d-e5f11996408d","topicId":"f91e0b3e-b56e-4d9f-942a-818b7644c1e6","topicName":"Hand foot and mouth disease","slug":"hand-foot-mouth-disease","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"3225558b-34b2-57a8-9399-a5b053236126","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"de1ed570-ebc5-52b7-bade-0a462f1ea43c","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"54765478-dfb0-5580-b132-42470b51c56a","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"8a0bc5e2-4d49-563b-91d2-83b1254b6d43","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"00ecb420-2a0b-5cd7-a8b2-7ad7861feaf3","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"22847687-4d32-573d-b20d-2b52b0191b5f","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"fe7bd73a-8682-510f-b7a8-04b806603723","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"66743340-d756-5b2c-8961-fd18d135ab4b","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"544cc9e8-7f46-5320-938b-a39e14cfb5c8","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"1cf1ec4b-da17-54db-8c7a-96bc63cc54cd","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"2434817f-71b9-53b1-a35a-96d1ccfe80ed","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
