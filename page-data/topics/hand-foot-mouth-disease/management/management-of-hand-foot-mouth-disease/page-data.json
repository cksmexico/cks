Aciclovir is converted to its active form by the viral enzyme thymidine kinase; however, thymidine kinase is not present in enteroviruses and there is, therefore, uncertainty regarding the benefit of using aciclovir in the treatment of HFMD [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hand-foot-mouth-disease/references/\">Ventarola, 2015</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Follow up</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on follow up are pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><h5>Arranging referral for persistent oral ulcers</h5><ul><li>The advice to refer people with persistent oral ulcers is based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline <em>Suspected cancer: recognition and referral</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hand-foot-mouth-disease/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>], which recommends that any person with an unexplained oral ulcer for more than 3 weeks should be referred via the 2-week wait referral pathway. However, because HFMD mainly affects children, CKS has recommended the use of clinical judgement to determine whether such referral is appropriate.</li></ul><h5>Pregnancy</h5><ul><li>The advice on management of pregnant women is largely based on an information sheet about HFMD published by the World Health Organization [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hand-foot-mouth-disease/references/\">WHO, 2012</a>].<ul><li>There is no clear evidence that maternal enterovirus infection, including HFMD, is associated with any specific risks to the fetus (such as increased risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, or congenital defect). Therefore, CKS has advised that most pregnant women can be managed as for non-pregnant women. The recommendation that specialist advice should be sought if the woman is immunocompromised is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li><li>Pregnant women may pass the virus to the infant if they are infected shortly before delivery or have symptoms at the time of delivery. Most newborns infected with an enterovirus have a mild illness, but, in rare cases, may develop an overwhelming infection leading to neonatal death. CKS has therefore pragmatically recommended that specialist advice should be sought and that observation of the neonate may be indicated for cases of maternal infection around the time of delivery.</li><li>Expert opinion from previous reviewers of this CKS topic was that routine investigation with swabs and faecal culture is probably unnecessary in pregnancy as it is unlikely to inform management. However, they stated that confirming the diagnosis may be helpful if the pregnant woman is immunocompromised or if delivery is expected within 3 weeks.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field f9d1d585-dc58-4b36-85d7-e7208516710a --><!-- end item 42d8e494-969b-4f08-a451-917e8aebd4c5 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"46286dbd-891c-5648-b68f-17af2fd3f6b3","slug":"preventing-transmission","fullItemName":"Preventing transmission","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field c5963e16-b191-4bf5-b9de-fe25af50d69e --><h3>Measures to reduce the risk of transmission</h3><!-- end field c5963e16-b191-4bf5-b9de-fe25af50d69e -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 6b12863a-9ac3-4b82-96f2-8250bc64702c --><!-- begin field 19c9d5ac-fe5e-4ba0-8fa5-3d091c22dad0 --><ul><li><strong>Advise the person on general hygiene measures to reduce the risk of transmission:</strong><ul><li>Ensure that hands are washed and dried thoroughly after using the toilet and before eating.</li><li>Ensure the mouth and nose are covered when coughing and sneezing.
