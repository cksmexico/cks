It suggests that referral for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) following mild traumatic brain injury may be considered in people with persistent symptoms who have not responded to reassurance after three months [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/head-injury/references/\">SIGN, 2013</a>].<ul><li>A US prospective cohort study of people during the first year after traumatic brain injury (n = 559) found that people who reported depression symptoms were more likely to have co-morbid anxiety, and depression was an independent predictor of reduced quality of life at one year follow up [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/head-injury/references/\">Bombardier et al, 2010</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Referral for specialist assessment</h5><ul><li>The SIGN guideline on brain injury rehabilitation states for people with ongoing symptoms, referral to a multidisciplinary neuropsychological rehabilitation programme is recommended, to address any cognitive, emotional, and behavioural difficulties the person may be experiencing [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/head-injury/references/\">SIGN, 2013</a>].<ul><li>For people with mild to moderate memory and cognitive impairment, 'external' aids such as diaries or electronic devices, and 'internal' strategies such as the use of visual imagery, can improve outcomes.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation to consider referral to neuroendocrinology if appropriate is based on expert opinion in a review article, to exclude complications of head injury such as hypopituitarism, which can present with non-specific symptoms and requires specialist investigation to confirm the diagnosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/head-injury/references/\">Zaben et al, 2013</a>].</li><li>The SIGN guideline notes that in a minority of people, head injury may be the result of a developing neurological condition, such as a brain tumour, which may cause loss of balance and predispose a person to falls. If there are persistent or new-onset focal neurological signs, for example, specialist referral to neurology should be arranged [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/head-injury/references/\">SIGN, 2013</a>]. </li></ul><!-- end field 92cae164-2961-48fb-820d-7f64d9647b12 --><!-- end item 3d38747b-f48b-4bd8-a405-ad41ab2fc509 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"038d1d1a-ecc8-5f0e-a916-046f6547cd09","slug":"initial-management","fullItemName":"Initial management","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field ef172770-68f5-4d69-a942-7392a35edfca --><h3>How should I initially manage a person with a head injury?</h3><!-- end field ef172770-68f5-4d69-a942-7392a35edfca -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item e4e183de-25a7-4033-87c6-dc39ba04016b --><!-- begin field b8ac229c-96d8-40bf-8e98-330bd3657ed6 --><ul><li><strong>Refer an adult or child immediately to the hospital emergency department, accompanied by a competent adult, if there are <em>any</em> of the following risk factors, which may indicate an intracranial complication or cervical spine injury:</strong> <ul><li>A <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/head-injury/management/head-injury/#the-glasgow-coma-scale\">Glasgow Coma Scale</a> (GCS) score of less than 15 on initial assessment.</li><li>Evidence of shock, or other injuries suggesting chest or abdominal trauma, limb or pelvic trauma, or significant vascular injury.</li><li>Dangerous mechanism of injury or <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/head-injury/management/head-injury/#assessment\">high-energy</a> head injury.</li><li>A history of bleeding or coagulation disorders, or current anticoagulant medication.</li><li>Current alcohol or drug intoxication.</li><li>Any loss of consciousness<strong> </strong>after the injury (even if they are fully alert on presentation).</li><li>Any post-traumatic seizure.</li><li>Any previous brain surgery.</li><li>Amnesia (antegrade or retrograde) lasting more than 5 minutes.
