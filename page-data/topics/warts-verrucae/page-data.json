They can appear anywhere on the skin but are commonly seen on the hands and feet.<ul><li>A verruca (also known as a plantar wart) is a wart on the sole of the foot.</li></ul></li><li>Cutaneous warts are common and can occur at any age, but are unusual in infants and very young children.<ul><li>Incidence is thought to increase during school years reaching a peak in adolescence and early adulthood before declining in later adulthood.</li></ul></li><li>Warts are usually spread by direct skin-to-skin contact, or indirectly via contact with contaminated floors or surfaces (for example in swimming pools or communal washing areas).</li><li>Warts may clear spontaneously at any time, or persist for years. Prognosis varies from person to person and resolution is usually more rapid in children.</li><li>Benign warts in immunocompetent people almost never undergo malignant change.</li><li>Warts are diagnosed from their typical appearance:<ul><li>Common warts are firm and raised with a rough surface that resembles a cauliflower (common on knuckles, knees, and fingers).</li><li>Periungual warts are common warts around the nails that can be painful and disturb nail growth — nail biting is a risk factor.</li><li>Plane warts are usually round, flat-topped, and skin coloured or greyish yellow (common on the backs of hands).</li><li>Filiform warts have a finger-like appearance and may have a stalk (more common on the face and neck).</li><li>Palmar and plantar warts grow on the palms and the soles of the feet (verrucae). They often have central dark dots (thrombosed capillaries) and may be painful.</li><li>Mosaic warts occur when palmar or plantar warts coalesce into larger plaques on the hands and feet.</li></ul></li><li>Although warts can be cosmetically unsightly, they are not harmful, usually do not cause symptoms, and most resolve without treatment.</li><li>Advice should be offered on reducing the risk of transmission and limiting personal spread of warts. Treatment should be considered if a wart is painful, cosmetically unsightly, persistent, or the person requests treatment.<ul><li>Treatment options for non-facial warts in adults and older children include topical salicylic acid, cryotherapy, or a combination of both (cryotherapy is not recommended for younger children).</li></ul></li><li>Warts can generally be managed in primary care, but referral to a dermatologist may be indicated if the person has:<ul><li>An uncertain diagnosis.</li><li>A facial wart.</li><li>Multiple recalcitrant warts and compromised immunity.</li><li>Extensive warts.</li><li>Persistent warts that are unresponsive to available primary care treatments.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 7738e160-abf1-4cb1-900a-27728aa3a663 --><!-- end item 27014995-a6d7-4c4e-9176-5cfd938a1e59 -->","topic":{"id":"41c94fc3-84c7-5d23-b0c1-b340dde561cf","topicId":"428bb097-7256-4343-b880-fb429b718d6d","topicName":"Warts and verrucae","slug":"warts-verrucae","aliases":["Veruccae and warts"],"chapters":[{"id":"1b91075b-35e9-580a-a349-b2aecac3712b","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"0ad476a8-9abf-5e68-8b94-60889f87963c","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"0c70c378-3d0c-573b-829d-ad3fe85ba7be","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"8117e71e-2ea4-540c-97dc-6f57d76c3eb9","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"20fb58f7-f730-5521-8a3e-e928324e4652","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"65d1b9d9-b162-5e9b-bfb9-98d935069c7f","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"6acab5c8-0505-5af9-8070-472e0850b28c","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"f5c53f23-1d42-550a-ade0-09928c029282","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"4f36f273-a3e3-5263-9d17-cde56dabdabe","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"6134b512-75ff-5330-9138-7c89c3f528f7","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"c1fcf745-8b2c-55ba-853a-44e100100069","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
