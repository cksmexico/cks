A literature search was conducted in August 2013 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key RCTs published since the last revision of the topic. This CKS topic incorporates recommendations from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guideline Management of suspected bacterial urinary tract infection in adults: a national clinical guideline. There have been changes to the structure and minor changes to the recommendations. Cranberry products are no longer recommended for prophylaxis of recurrent UTI.</p><p><strong>February 2013</strong> — minor update.

Issued in December 2009.</p><p><strong>April to October 2009</strong> — converted from CKS guidance to CKS topic structure. The evidence-base has been reviewed in detail, and recommendations are more clearly justified and transparently linked to the supporting evidence.

The approach to managing suspected cystitis reflects a change in focus from basing treatment decisions on accurate diagnosis to basing treatment decisions on the assessment of the patient's risks and preferences.</p><p><strong>October 2008</strong> — minor update to reflect guidance from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) to avoid broad spectrum antibiotics (such as co-amoxiclav, quinolones, and cephalosporins) when narrow spectrum antibiotics remain effective, as broad spectrum antibiotics increase the risk of Clostridium difficile, MRSA, and resistant UTIs.
