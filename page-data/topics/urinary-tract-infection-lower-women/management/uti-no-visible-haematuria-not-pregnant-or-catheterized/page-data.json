The NICE guideline committee acknowledges that prescribers in the UK may be less familiar with second-choice antibiotics such as pivmecillinam or fosfomycin — these antibiotics are often used in other European countries [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/urinary-tract-infection-lower-women/references/\">EAU, 2018</a>].</li><li>Trimethoprim is recommended as an alternative first choice where there is low risk of resistance — the risk of resistance may be lower if trimethoprim has not been used in the preceding 3 months, recent urine culture suggests susceptibility (but trimethoprim was not used), and in younger people in areas where local data suggest resistance is low. A higher risk of resistance may be more likely with recent use and in older women in residential facilities [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/urinary-tract-infection-lower-women/references/\">NICE, 2018d</a>].</li><li>The European Association of Urology [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/urinary-tract-infection-lower-women/references/\">EAU, 2018</a>] recommend fosfomycin, pivmecillinam and nitrofurantoin as drugs of first choice based on susceptibility patterns in Europe. Use of alternative antimicrobials (such as trimethoprim alone or combined with a sulphonamide) are advised as drugs of first choice only in areas where known resistance rates for <em>E. coli</em> are less than 20%.</li><li>NICE guidance [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/urinary-tract-infection-lower-women/references/\">NICE, 2018d</a>] states that prescribers should take into account local antimicrobial resistance patterns as these vary by area.</li></ul></li><li>Duration of antibiotic treatment:<ul><li>NICE [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/urinary-tract-infection-lower-women/references/\">NICE, 2018d</a>] recommend a 3-day course of treatment in non-pregnant women with uncomplicated lower UTI — this is based on evidence that a 3 day course is as effective as a 5–10 day course and is associated with significantly fewer adverse events.</li></ul></li><li>Delayed script/back-up antibiotics<ul><li>NICE guidance states that in most cases antibiotics are needed for treatment of lower UTI. However, in some non-pregnant women, acute uncomplicated lower UTI can be self-limiting and delay of antibiotic treatment with provision of a back-up prescription may lead to symptom resolution without antibiotic treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/urinary-tract-infection-lower-women/references/\">NICE, 2018d</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>When to seek review</h5><p>The recommendation on advising all women to seek urgent medical review if symptoms worsen rapidly or significantly at any time or fail to improve within 48 hours of starting antibiotics is based on guidance from NICE [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/urinary-tract-infection-lower-women/references/\">NICE, 2018d</a>] and PHE [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/urinary-tract-infection-lower-women/references/\">PHE, 2017</a>].</p><ul><li>Non-response may be due to a resistant organism and the woman may require further investigation and treatment — a urine sample should be sent to identify sensitivities and microbiology advice sought if a multi-resistant organism is cultured [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/urinary-tract-infection-lower-women/references/\">HPA, 2011</a>].</li><li>Failure to culture bacteria in the urine of a woman with cystitis may be a false negative result but the possibility of an alternative cause for symptoms is significantly increased and should be considered.</li></ul><h5>Follow up of culture results</h5><p>Guidance from NICE [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/urinary-tract-infection-lower-women/references/\">NICE, 2018d</a>] and PHE [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/urinary-tract-infection-lower-women/references/\">PHE, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/urinary-tract-infection-lower-women/references/\">PHE, 2018a</a>] agree that choice of antibiotic should be reviewed when culture and sensitivity results become available.</p><!-- end field e91acadf-6cb7-486b-811e-a71b00f67d52 --><!-- end item 3b39cfae-486d-4483-9800-a71b00f67d52 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
