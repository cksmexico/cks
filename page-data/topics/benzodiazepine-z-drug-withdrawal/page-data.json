Benzodiazepines can be grouped into hypnotics and anxiolytics:<ul><li>Hypnotics are used for short term treatment of insomnia and include nitrazepam, loprazolam, lormetazolam, and temazepam.</li><li>Anxiolytics are effective in alleviating anxiety states and include diazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, alprazolam, and chlordiazepoxide.</li></ul></li><li>Z-drugs are non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, developed to overcome some of the adverse effects of benzodiazepines (such as next-day sedation, dependence, and withdrawal). Like benzodiazepines, they are also GABA receptor agonists. The two z-drugs available in the UK are zolpidem, and zopiclone.</li><li>Despite warnings regarding the long-term use of benzodiazepines and z-drugs, millions of prescriptions are still issued for these drugs in primary care each year.</li><li>People on long-term benzodiazepines or z-drugs should be advised to stop because:<ul><li>Tolerance to these drugs progressively reduces their effectiveness for the treatment of insomnia or anxiety.</li><li>Dependence may develop, and continuing treatment may serve only to prevent withdrawal symptoms.</li></ul></li><li>Other benefits of stopping these drugs include:<ul><li>Avoiding their adverse effects (e.g. depression and increased anxiety).</li><li>Reducing the risk of a road traffic accident, as benzodiazepines can impair driving performance.</li><li>Minimizing the risk of drug interactions (e.g. with alcohol or other drugs with sedative actions).</li></ul></li><li>If a person wishes to stop taking benzodiazepines or z-drugs:<ul><li>An assessment should be carried out to determine whether it is a suitable time for them to stop, and whether they have symptoms of depression, anxiety, long term insomnia, or any other medical problems.</li><li>Consideration should be given to whether withdrawal can be appropriately managed in primary care.</li><li>A decision should be made regarding whether the person can stop their current drug without changing to diazepam. Withdrawal may be undertaken with or without switching to diazepam.</li><li>A gradual drug withdrawal schedule (dose tapering) that is flexible should be negotiated. The person should guide adjustments so that they remain comfortable with the withdrawal.</li><li>Reviews should be frequent to detect and manage problems early and to provide advice and encouragement during and after the drug withdrawal.</li><li>If a person does not succeed on their first attempt, they should be encouraged to try again.</li></ul></li><li>People who do not wish to stop taking benzodiazepines or z-drugs should:<ul><li>Be advised of the benefits of stopping.</li><li>Be listened to, and any concerns about stopping should be addressed.</li><li>Not be pressurized.</li><li>Be reviewed at a later date, if appropriate.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field b06d6bd9-3928-4bba-aa41-0cd184b961de --><!-- end item e9513a3b-fb6b-4289-a1b2-837dae786119 -->","topic":{"id":"e3f1abb8-a968-53c3-bc6a-12e1b2886ed2","topicId":"35151ccb-5966-4e29-97a4-191f3f2aef6a","topicName":"Benzodiazepine and z-drug withdrawal","slug":"benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal","aliases":["Z-drug and benzodiazepine withdrawal"],"chapters":[{"id":"ddeb227b-ec5e-5a69-b033-23d16e492302","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"ca1d0037-207c-5656-8c1a-64eb8f8a6adf","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"4f9475f8-9d93-5b3d-9cc7-66f08d975494","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"33c4d415-a5bf-586c-af94-95833f29167f","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"814181c9-c71c-54f0-a9f2-a7b2a5f73459","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"2237f5ce-b47f-5f59-80d4-2098a2fafae1","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"14f4d723-2346-5509-b69f-ec1690c54f89","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"978d3882-5b77-58d0-9081-5f1879a2e244","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"df6950b2-9910-5c3e-9f7e-a89c359ba5cf","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"f78c4bb6-5d1b-516c-acb6-5a8a6add79ec","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"1d88ca0e-4d2b-56ae-9602-a213d4c8767e","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
