are based on expert opinion contained within published reviews and guidelines on managing benzodiazepine and z-drug dependence [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\"

guidelines continue to form the basis of current guidance).</p><h5>Gradual withdrawal of benzodiazepines and z-drugs</h5><ul><li>Withdrawing benzodiazepines slowly is recommended to allow a smooth, gradual fall in the level of drugs in the blood, thus minimizing withdrawal symptoms [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">Ashton, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">Lader et al, 2009</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">Lingford-Hughes et al, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">BNF 75, 2018</a>].</li><li>Abrupt drug withdrawal (particularly following the use of high doses) can produce confusion, toxic psychosis, convulsions, or a condition resembling delirium tremens [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">Lader et al, 2009</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">Ford and Law, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">All Wales Medicines Strategy Group, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">BNF 76, 2018</a>].</li><li>Gradual drug withdrawal is also recommended for people dependent on z-drugs as the manufacturers of these drugs warn that abrupt termination of treatment can lead to withdrawal symptoms, particularly in people taking high doses [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">ABPI, 2018a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">ABPI, 2018b</a>]. Given that they work similarly to benzodiazepines, the same approaches have therefore been recommended for z-drug withdrawal [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">Ashton, 2002b</a>].</li></ul><h5>Switching to diazepam</h5><ul><li>Switching to diazepam is recommended for some people — particularly if they have difficulty withdrawing or if they are on short-acting, potent benzodiazepines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">Ashton, 2002a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">Ashton, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">Taylor et al, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">BNF 76, 2018</a>].</li><li>Diazepam is preferred because:<ul><li>It possesses a long half-life (20–100 hours), thus avoiding sharp fluctuations in plasma level.</li><li>It is available in a variety of strengths and formulations. This facilitates stepwise dose substitution from other benzodiazepines or z-drugs and allows for small incremental reductions in dosage (especially at low doses).</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Time required for drug withdrawal</h5><ul><li>Although some experts have recommended drug withdrawal over 8–12 weeks, or longer (such as 6 months) if the person has tried to stop before but failed [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">Lader et al, 2009</a>], the time needed for drug withdrawal can vary from 4 weeks to a year or longer [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">Ashton, 2002a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">Ashton, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">BNF 76, 2018</a>].</li><li>Consequently, no specific time frame has been recommended as drug withdrawal should be titrated according to the severity of withdrawal symptoms and individual preference. However, it is recommended that the person should be encouraged not to prolong the drug withdrawal to a slower rate towards the end [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">Ashton, 2002a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">Lader et al, 2009</a>].</li><li>The drug manufacturer advises that treatment should not exceed 4 weeks including the period of tapering off [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">ABPI, 2019</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Examples of drug withdrawal schedules</h5><ul><li>These are adapted from the Aston Manual [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">Ashton, 2002b</a>]. This widely published manual was developed on the basis of clinical experience of managing people withdrawing from benzodiazepines and z-drugs in an English specialist clinic over a 12-year period.</li><li>The drug withdrawal schedules are comparable to that recommended by the British National Formulary which suggests withdrawing in steps of about one-eighth (range one-tenth to one-quarter) of the daily dose every fortnight [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benzodiazepine-z-drug-withdrawal/references/\">BNF 76, 2018</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field 43863277-0eb8-42e2-bfa0-7bdf0a748efb --><!-- end item af2a7e58-c6d7-4c64-8144-88aa57959b5b -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
