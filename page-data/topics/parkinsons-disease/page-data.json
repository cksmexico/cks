loss of the dopamine-containing cells of the substantia nigra. </li><li>Parkinsonism is an umbrella term for the clinical syndrome involving bradykinesia together with at least one of the following: rigidity, tremor, and postural instability.<ul><li>Parkinson's disease is the most common form of parkinsonism.</li><li>The characteristic features of Parkinson’s disease usually present unilaterally initially, but become bilateral as the disease progresses. </li><li>Other causes of parkinsonism include drug-induced, cerebrovascular disease, Lewy body dementia, multiple system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy.</li></ul></li><li>Parkinson's disease is a common condition in elderly people, with a prevalence of 1–2% in people older than 65 years of age. </li><li>Typically, Parkinson's disease is slowly progressive, but the prognosis is variable.<ul><li>The mortality rate for elderly people with Parkinson's disease is 2–5 times higher than for age-matched controls.</li><li>People with early-onset disease may have a later onset of motor complications and cognitive impairment.</li><li>The risk of dementia is 2–6 times higher in people with Parkinson's disease than in healthy controls. </li></ul></li><li>The complications of Parkinson’s disease include: <ul><li>Motor complications (usually related to the use of anti-parkinsonian medication), such as immobility, slowness, communication difficulties, motor fluctuations, dyskinesia, and freezing of gait. </li><li>Non-motor complications, such as depression, anxiety, impulse control disorders, psychotic symptoms, dementia, sleep disturbance, autonomic dysfunction, falls, and pain. </li></ul></li><li>People with suspected Parkinson's disease should be referred urgently, and untreated, to a specialist in movement disorders for confirmation of the diagnosis and exclusion of alternative conditions. </li><li>If Parkinson's disease is suspected, but the person is taking a drug known to induce parkinsonism: <ul><li>The drug should be reduced or stopped if appropriate. </li><li>Referral should not be delayed to assess the response. </li></ul></li><li>A person with confirmed Parkinson’s disease should be managed by a specialist multidisciplinary team including a Parkinson's disease nurse specialist who should monitor the person and help manage symptoms and complications.</li><li>Primary care may be involved in the following: <ul><li>Onward referral to the multidisciplinary team, such as speech and language therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, adult social care, community nursing, continence and urology specialists, mental health services, and palliative care specialists, if appropriate. </li><li>Advising the person, at the time of diagnosis, and if there is a change in their clinical condition, to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and their car insurer.</li><li>Starting or altering anti-parkinsonian medication on the advice of a specialist. </li><li>To not suddenly stop any anti-parkinsonian medication as this can precipitate acute akinesia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. </li><li>Identifying worsening motor and non-motor symptoms and complications, and liaising with the person’s specialist team to help manage these. </li><li>Managing co-morbidities appropriately, and avoiding or using with caution any drugs that could exacerbate parkinsonism or interact with anti-parkinsonian medication. </li><li>Offering the opportunity to discuss the person's prognosis, advance care planning and end-of-life issues at any stage after the initial diagnosis, and offering referral to the palliative care team as appropriate.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 70816c5d-0fd4-4bcd-908f-1e28a805ebd4
