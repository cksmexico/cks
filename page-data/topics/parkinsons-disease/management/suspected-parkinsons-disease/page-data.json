class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/parkinsons-disease/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li><li>The recommendation for urgent referral aims to prevent any unnecessary psychological distress arising from a delay in diagnosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/parkinsons-disease/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>]. In addition, the EPDA consensus statement highlights that people with confirmed Parkinson's disease are offered medication early to improve their quality of life and possibly delay the progression of disease, and the multidisciplinary team can be involved early to delay the development of complications [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/parkinsons-disease/references/\">European Parkinson's Disease Association, 2011</a>].</li><li>Specialist referral allows additional neuroimaging, neurophysiological, or neuropsychological testing to be arranged if needed, to clarify the diagnosis and exclude other causes of parkinsonism in people with suspected Parkinson's disease. Making an accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is important in determining the person's prognosis and treatment regime [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/parkinsons-disease/references/\">Berardelli, 2013</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to refer a person, even if drug-induced parkinsonism is suspected and the causative drug is stopped, is based on expert opinion in a review article, that people with parkinsonism induced by antipsychotic drugs can take up to 8 weeks to improve when the dose is reduced, or anti-parkinsonian drugs are given [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/parkinsons-disease/references/\">Hirose, 2006</a>]. In addition, expert opinion of two previous external reviewers of this CKS topic is that parkinsonism can persist for longer than 8 weeks after drug withdrawal.</li></ul><!-- end field f784eef2-89ad-4f40-84ca-a5ba34a10577 --><!-- end item 7447754b-176d-4208-a273-2b6f8d5a20b8 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
