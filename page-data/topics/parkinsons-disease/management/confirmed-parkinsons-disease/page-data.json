In addition, it recommends that the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease should be reviewed regularly (every 6–12 months) by the person's specialist, and reconsidered if any atypical clinical features develop [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/parkinsons-disease/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li><li>The SIGN guideline highlights the poor specificity of the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in the early stages of disease, and the importance of specialist review to monitor symptoms and check for a response to anti-parkinsonian medication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/parkinsons-disease/references/\">SIGN, 2010</a>].</li><li>Similarly, European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS)/Movement Disorder Society-European Section (MDS-ES) guidelines highlight that the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease may change at specialist follow up, for example, if a person develops atypical signs suggesting an alternative diagnosis, or if there is an insufficient response to dopaminergic drug treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/parkinsons-disease/references/\">Berardelli, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h5>Advice on vitamin D supplementation</h5><ul><li>NICE noted that people with Parkinson's disease are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency due to potentially being more sedentary, and at increased risk of osteoporosis and falls [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/parkinsons-disease/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].<ul><li>NICE cites limited evidence of a theoretical reduction in the risk of complications from falls and the benefits of improved bone health with vitamin D supplementation, although NICE acknowledges that neither of these outcomes was reported in the analyzed study evidence. The available study (n = 112) did, however, show potential benefits in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) for people taking vitamin D, which is an overall measure of disease activity, however NICE noted that the improvement in UPDRS score was below the minimal clinically important difference, so this is of uncertain clinical benefit.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Ensuring correct timing of anti-parkinsonian medication</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on ensuring the person and also carers/hospital staff are aware of the need for the correct timing of anti-parkinsonian medication is pragmatic based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><p><strong>Liaison with the specialist team regarding anti-parkinsonian medication</strong> </p><ul><li>The recommendation to only start or alter anti-parkinsonian medication on the advice of a specialist is pragmatic, based on the fact that the drug treatment of Parkinson's disease becomes increasingly complex as the disease progresses. In addition, a GP with an average list size of about 1,500 patients will only see one new case of Parkinson's disease every 3.3 years, making it difficult to develop and maintain expertise in primary care [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/parkinsons-disease/references/\">SIGN, 2010</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to ensure that changes to repeat medication are made promptly in primary care is based on a small retrospective survey of case notes (n = 49) which found that 29% of medication changes recommended at specialist outpatient clinic appointments were not completed [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/parkinsons-disease/references/\">Ng et al, 2007</a>].</li><li>The recommendation on not suddenly stopping anti-parkinsonian medication due to the risks of acute akinesia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome is based on expert opinion in the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/parkinsons-disease/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>] and in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/parkinsons-disease/references/\">Berman, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/parkinsons-disease/references/\">Muzerengi, 2015</a>].</li></ul><p><strong>Management of motor symptoms</strong></p><ul><li>The recommendation to identify and manage worsening motor symptoms and complications is also based on European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS)/Movement Disorder Society-European Section (MDS-ES) guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/parkinsons-disease/references/\">Berardelli, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h5>Management of non-motor symptoms</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to identify and manage any non-motor symptoms is based on a small self-completed postal survey (n = 130) of Parkinson's disease patients attending specialist clinics.
