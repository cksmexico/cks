It had limitations in understanding hospitalisations, complications, and the prevention of complications occurring in cases of severe infection, and mortality.</li><li>There was no evidence from RCTs for non-seasonal influenza viruses with high case fatality rates, or a novel influenza virus with pandemic potential, or RCTs in severely ill people (due to ethical considerations).</li><li>In the absence of appropriate RCT data on severe influenza, observational studies have important contributions to make to policy development.</li><li>A substantial volume of observational data was not considered in the review, including evidence of the ability of NAIs to stop the progression of severe cases of H5N1 or pandemic H1N1 infection. </li></ul></li><li>A subsequent National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) health technology assessment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/influenza-seasonal/references/\">NIHR, 2016</a>] reached similar conclusions to the Cochrane review: <ul><li>Oseltamivir and zanamivir cause small reductions in the time to alleviation of influenza symptoms in adults, but not in asthmatic children.</li><li>The use of oseltamivir increases the risk of nausea, vomiting and psychiatric events in adults and vomiting in children and may reduce risk of diarrhoea and cardiac events in adults.</li><li>Observational studies fail to show that oseltamivir has a protective effect on mortality among people with 2009A/H1N1 influenza.</li><li>Prophylaxis with either oseltamivir or zanamivir may reduce symptomatic influenza in individuals and in households but there was no reduction in all other influenza outcomes, including overall influenza like illness reported as an adverse event on-treatment.</li><li>However, the results did not discount a potential benefit of using zanamivir and oseltamivir in individuals under particular situations, for example in immunocompromised or in compassionate cases, for which few other therapeutic options may exist.</li></ul></li><li>PHE advises that it is essential that physicians treating severely unwell people in any setting are not deterred from prescribing NAIs as a result of confusion over efficacy, and that this is especially true for people hospitalised with proven or suspected influenza [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/influenza-seasonal/references/\">PHE, 2014</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Unlicensed zanamivir</h5><ul><li>In addition to the licensed inhalation powder, zanamivir is also available as an unlicensed aqueous solution which may be administered intravenously or through a nebuliser [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/influenza-seasonal/references/\">PHE, 2019</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/influenza-seasonal/references/\">Joint Formulary Committee, 2019</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Influenza immunization</h5><ul><li>All people who are eligible for antiviral prophylaxis are also suitable for influenza immunization (unless there are contraindications).<ul><li>NICE states that vaccination has been established as the first-line intervention to prevent influenza and its complications, and the use of drugs as recommended should not detract from efforts to ensure that all eligible people receive vaccination [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/influenza-seasonal/references/\">NICE, 2014b</a>].</li><li>For more information on influenza immunization, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/immunizations-seasonal-influenza/\">Immunizations - seasonal influenza</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field ccbe3fd6-f57c-499f-8097-5df77babdd2b --><!-- end item 0c4c3061-fcb2-4ebc-9dd7-4a24450e3c90 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
