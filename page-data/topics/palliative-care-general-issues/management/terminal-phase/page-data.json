For detailed information on the evidence NICE used to make these recommendations, see the full <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng31/chapter/Recommendations\" data-hyperlink-id=\"6f42afd5-657d-49b0-ab4f-a93100a1e54f\">NICE guideline</a>.</p><p>Recommendations on clinical assisted hydration are based on General Medical Council guidance for doctors, <em>Treatment and care towards the end of life: good practice in decision making </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-general-issues/references/\">GMC, 2010</a>]. The GMC advise that ‘The current evidence about the benefits, burdens and risks of these techniques as patients approach the end of life is not clear-cut. This can lead to concerns that patients who are unconscious or semi-conscious may be experiencing distressing symptoms and complications, or otherwise be suffering either because their needs for nutrition or hydration are not being met or because attempts to meet their perceived needs for nutrition or hydration may be causing them avoidable suffering. Nutrition and hydration provided by tube or drip are regarded in law as medical treatment, and should be treated in the same way as other medical interventions. Nonetheless, some people see nutrition and hydration, whether taken orally or by tube or drip, as part of basic nurture for the patient that should almost always be provided. For this reason it is especially important that you listen to and consider the views of the patient and of those close to them (including their cultural and religious views) and explain the issues to be considered, including the benefits, burdens and risks of providing clinically assisted nutrition and hydration. You should make sure that patients, those close to them and the healthcare team understand that, when clinically assisted nutrition or hydration would be of overall benefit, it will always be offered; and that if a decision is taken not to provide clinically assisted nutrition or hydration, the patient will continue to receive high-quality care, with any symptoms addressed.' </p><!-- end field 5def436e-d611-461b-ab0d-a598a45740a7 --><!-- end item 67314488-425e-409c-b671-c5a9adc470ee -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
