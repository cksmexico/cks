Expert opinion in the BMJ Best Practice guideline <em>Constipation in Children</em> notes that 'Perianal group A streptococcal infection causing painful defecation has been found to be a strong precipitator in a small, but easily treated, sub-group of children with constipation' and provides information on the clinical features of such infection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/constipation-in-children/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2019</a>].</p><h4>No specific investigations in primary care</h4><ul><li>NICE evaluated the evidence for using plain abdominal X-ray to diagnose chronic idiopathic constipation in children and concluded that X-ray has little or no value to either confirm or exclude a diagnosis of idiopathic constipation. The guideline development group further noted that abdominal X-ray appearances may be misinterpreted, usually over-estimating faecal loading or missing rectal impaction. It concluded that plain abdominal X-ray should not be routinely requested to diagnose idiopathic constipation, and should only be performed if absolutely necessary and if requested by specialist services [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/constipation-in-children/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2010</a>].</li><li>Similarly, NICE evaluated the evidence for using abdominal ultrasound in children with chronic constipation and concluded that there is no evidence that abdominal ultrasound is a useful addition to thorough history taking and physical examination [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/constipation-in-children/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2010</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field cab7e618-3834-4eee-a763-5e748997e283 --><!-- end item 6b01c640-b52f-4138-936b-2c0c84f00010 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
