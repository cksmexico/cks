Distress or other features are better clinical indicators of true constipation. It may be appropriate to monitor an otherwise well, thriving breastfed baby before deciding whether treatment for constipation is indicated.</li></ul><h4>Diagnosis of faecal impaction</h4><ul><li>The recommendations on the diagnosis of faecal impaction are based on the experience and opinion of the NICE guideline development group, who states that it is important to identify faecal impaction as the child will require disimpaction prior to prescribing maintenance laxative treatment.</li></ul><h4>Digital rectal examination (DRE)</h4><ul><li>NICE recognized that although DRE is recommended by several national and international clinical guidelines, evidence of its value in the assessment of children with chronic constipation is poor. NICE concluded that DRE does not improve the diagnosis of faecal impaction in chronic idiopathic constipation.<ul><li>Rarely, it may be of value in diagnosing an underlying cause for constipation, such as anal stenosis (particularly in a child in their first year), other anatomical abnormalities, or Hirschsprung's disease.</li></ul></li><li>In view of the observation that DRE is frequently poorly tolerated by children or their parents, ideally the examination should be performed only once for a child and by the most competent clinician available. CKS has interpreted this to mean a secondary care specialist.</li></ul><!-- end field 7e10cf54-4768-42d9-b716-c6155a4e89f6 --><!-- end item 2a894d4c-2840-4e50-80a8-00413beff48a -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
