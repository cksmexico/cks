They are also supported by a literature review and expert opinion in the European and North American clinical guideline <em>Evaluation and treatment of functional constipation in infants and children: evidence-based recommendations from ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/constipation-in-children/references/\">Tabbers, 2014</a>].</p><h5>Information and advice</h5><ul><li>The recommendation on giving information and advice to the child and their family/carers is based on the NICE guideline that highlights that the level of information and support given can play a significant role in the effectiveness and success of constipation management regimes, help to empower children and their family/carers, and increase their involvement in all aspects of their care.</li></ul><h5>Advice on behavioural interventions</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on behavioural interventions are based on the experience and opinion of the NICE guideline development group (GDG) and on expert opinion in the review article <em>Childhood Constipation</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/constipation-in-children/references/\">Auth, 2012</a>].</li></ul><h5>Diet and lifestyle advice</h5><ul><li>The NICE GDG felt that poor diet alone is rarely the cause of childhood constipation, and noted that treatment with laxatives is sometimes delayed while dietary and lifestyle adjustments are made, which may worsen constipation. It advocated that any changes in diet should be made alongside laxative treatment and possible behavioural interventions, and that dietary interventions alone should not be used as first-line treatment for idiopathic constipation.</li><li>The NICE GDG found no evidence that increasing fibre-rich foods, such as fruit, vegetables, and cereals, is effective in managing constipation in children who eat a healthy balanced diet. Excessive dietary fibre may exacerbate symptoms and increase the risk of soiling, and both the NICE guideline and the ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN clinical guideline found insufficient evidence to recommend fibre supplements, such as prune and fig concentrate, for the treatment of constipation in children and young people.</li><li>The NICE guideline states that there is no good-quality evidence for the effectiveness of increasing physical activity to improve constipation, but as physical inactivity may be a contributory factor in constipation, regular exercise should be encouraged as it may reduce the likelihood of a relapse in constipation in the future.</li></ul><h5>Recommended fluid intake</h5><ul><li>NICE found one open-label randomized controlled trial that showed that increasing fluid intake did not have a significant impact on stool frequency, consistency, or difficulty passing stools in children with constipation, compared with controls who did not increase fluid intake. The NICE GDG concluded that achieving recommended levels of fluid intake is important, as dehydration may be worsened by the use of osmotic laxatives, but there is no evidence for advising increased fluid intake beyond recommended levels.</li><li>A subsequent NICE evidence update also reported limited evidence suggesting that raising fluid intake above normal has no effect [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/constipation-in-children/references/\">NICE, 2012</a>].</li><li>The recommendations on fluid intake for different age groups are derived from expert opinion in the National Academy of Sciences guideline <em>Dietary reference intakes for water, potassium, sodium, chloride, and sulfate</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/constipation-in-children/references/\">Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, 2005</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field 10f28647-1fb9-4121-b577-a41a199b3d6c --><!-- end item 7b424328-7400-466f-b019-830e43bca788 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"edd86c4d-ca09-59ca-9c26-4eba2c327bd3","slug":"faecal-disimpaction-treatment","fullItemName":"Faecal disimpaction treatment","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field f850f57b-77a6-47bf-977b-1eb335a0e013 --><h3>How should I treat faecal impaction?</h3><!-- end field f850f57b-77a6-47bf-977b-1eb335a0e013 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 6eb9d764-a3fa-4384-8e9e-b42f26903018 --><!-- begin field fdd462be-f4d1-4e0f-8c5f-342e751ee4ab --><ul><li><strong>Advise the child and/or their parents/carers that treating impaction can initially increase symptoms of soiling and abdominal pain, and ensure the child has easy access to a toilet.</strong></li><li><strong>Offer the following oral laxative regimen, and review all children undergoing disimpaction within 1 week:</strong><ul><li>Prescribe a macrogol (Movicol<sup>® </sup>Paediatric Plain or Movicol<sup>® </sup>depending on the child's age) first-line, using an <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/constipation-in-children/prescribing-information/doses-titration/\">escalating dose regimen</a>.
