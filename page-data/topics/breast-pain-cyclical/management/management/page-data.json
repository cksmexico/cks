Expert opinion in a textbook:<em> ABC of breast diseases</em> describes reassurance as the 'mainstay of treatment' for mastalgia [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Iddon and Dixon, 2012</a>].</li></ul><h5>Wearing a well-fitting bra </h5><ul><li>The advice to wear a well-fitting bra is based on expert opinion in a US guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">University of Michigan Health System, 2013</a>] and review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Salzman et al, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Amin et al, 2013</a>]. The recommendation to consider wearing a soft support bra at night is based on expert opinion in a textbook with the rationale that it supports tender breast tissues and reduces tension on the chest wall [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Iddon and Dixon, 2012</a>].</li></ul><h5>Simple oral analgesia as first-line treatment </h5><ul><li>The recommendation to offer simple oral analgesia as first-line treatment is based on expert opinion in a US guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">University of Michigan Health System, 2013</a>] and review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Salzman et al, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Amin et al, 2013</a>].</li><li>A systematic review (search date February 2014) found no good quality evidence comparing the effectiveness of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with placebo for cyclical breast pain [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Goyal, 2014</a>]. CKS identified no trials of the use of paracetamol for cyclical breast pain.</li></ul><h5>Topical NSAIDs as first-line treatment</h5><ul><li>A systematic review (search date February 2014) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Goyal, 2014</a>] found evidence from:<ul><li>One small randomized controlled trial (RCT — n = 60) that topical diclofenac may be more effective than placebo in reducing breast pain. Irregular usage and abruptly stopping treatment created no serious problems. </li><li>Another randomized controlled trial (n = 100) of a non-significant effect when topical and oral diclofenac were compared for the treatment of cyclical and non-cyclical breast pain.</li></ul></li><li>Expert opinion suggests that topical NSAIDs are effective in relieving breast pain and that the benefits outweigh the risk of adverse effects if long-term treatment is avoided [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Salzman et al, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">University of Michigan Health System, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Goyal, 2014</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Pain chart</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><h5>Managing premenstrual syndrome</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is pragmatic and based on expert opinion in a textbook that different treatments may be considered if cyclical breast pain is part of a premenstrual syndrome [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Iddon and Dixon, 2012</a>].</li></ul><h5>Referral</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to refer if cyclical breast pain is affecting quality of life or sleep is based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Dixon and Thomas, 2012</a>]. The timescale of 3 months is based on observational trial evidence in a US guideline on common breast problems [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">University of Michigan Health System, 2013</a>].<ul><li>A systematic review (search date: February 2014) found evidence from randomized controlled trials to suggest that danazol, tamoxifen, and gonadorelin analogues reduce cyclical breast pain compared with placebo [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Goyal, 2014</a>]. Expert opinion in a textbook also discusses the use of tamoxifen and danazol [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Iddon and Dixon, 2012</a>].</li><li>However, these treatments can cause unpleasant and serious adverse effects [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Iddon and Dixon, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Goyal, 2014</a>]. CKS therefore advises that their use is limited to specialists or those with a specialist interest in the management of breast pain.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Treatments not recommended</h5><h5>Changing or stopping medication</h5><ul><li>Changing current medication to treat breast pain is not advised as there is little evidence to suggest a link between any drug treatment and the onset of cyclical breast pain. There is no evidence to suggest that the use of combined oral contraceptives causes cyclical breast pain. There is evidence from a randomized controlled trial  (n = 82) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Graham and Sherwin, 1992</a>] and a cohort study (n = 552) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Bancroft and Rennie, 1993</a>] that premenstrual breast pain may improve with oral contraceptive use.</li></ul><h5>Evening primrose oil</h5><ul><li>There is evidence from a systematic review of four RCTs to show that evening primrose oil is no more effective than placebo at reducing the frequency and severity of breast pain [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Srivastava et al, 2007</a>] and a lack of good quality evidence to support its use. For this reason, in 2002, the UK Medicines Control Agency withdrew the prescription licence from evening primrose oil to treat breast pain [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Iddon and Dixon, 2012</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Progestogen-only contraceptives</h5><ul><li>There is weak evidence from a cross-sectional survey to suggest that parenteral medroxyprogesterone acetate reduces cyclical breast pain compared with control [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Euhus and Uyehara, 1997</a>], but it is insufficient to recommend this as a treatment. There is weak evidence that oral progestogen (oral medroxyprogesterone) is no better than placebo at treating breast pain [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Maddox et al, 1990</a>].</li></ul><h5>Diet changes</h5><ul><li>There is little good-quality evidence to suggest that a diet low in fat or caffeine is beneficial for the treatment of cyclical breast pain [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Chase et al, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-pain-cyclical/references/\">Iddon and Dixon, 2012</a>].</li></ul><h5>Antibiotics, diuretics, pyridoxine, or vitamin E</h5><ul><li>There is a lack of evidence to suggest a benefit from the use of antibiotics, diuretics, pyridoxine, or vitamin E. Even though there is a placebo effect from these agents, they have potential adverse effects and therefore should not be used for the treatment of breast pain. </li></ul><!-- end field 547531e2-fc42-44b4-a51e-f1fce8bb809a --><!-- end item 311d5e6c-1222-476f-bae5-3ac35b6542d8 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
