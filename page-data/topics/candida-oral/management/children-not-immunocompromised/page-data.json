See the section on <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/background-information/complications/\">Complications</a> for more information.</li></ul><h5>Initial referral (or seeking specialist advice)</h5><ul><li>Expert opinion in a review article is that oral candidal infection that becomes chronic in an infant or child is unusual and requires further assessment by a specialist. Treatment options that may be suitable for initiation in secondary care include oral fluconazole [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/references/\">Samaranayake et al, 2009</a>].</li></ul><h5>Excluding risk factors</h5><ul><li>Oral candidiasis is common in infants, but in older children, it may signify immune deficiency or other illness [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/references/\">Hoppe, 1997a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/references/\">Gonsalves et al, 2007</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/references/\">Samaranayake et al, 2009</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/references/\">Hay and Ashbee, 2010</a>]. CKS, therefore recommends excluding risk factors in an otherwise healthy child with oral candidiasis.</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article is that the treatment of oral candidiasis should include recognizing and eliminating the underlying causes, such as ill-fitting oral appliances, history of medications (such as antibiotics and corticosteroids), immunological and endocrine disorders, and nutritional deficiency [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/references/\">Patil, 2015</a>].</li></ul><h5>Antifungal treatment</h5><ul><li><strong>Miconazole</strong> has a broad spectrum of activity against fungal and yeast species [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/references/\">Samaranayake et al, 2009</a>].<ul><li>Good evidence from two comparative randomized controlled trials (RCTs) shows that topical miconazole is considerably more effective than nystatin suspension for the treatment of oral candidal infection in infants (although there is a lack of placebo-controlled trials for either drug) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/references/\">Hoppe and Hahn, 1996</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/references/\">Hoppe, 1997b</a>].</li><li>A systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the efficacy and safety of miconazole for oral candidiasis and found that it was more effective than nystatin for thrush, and seemed to be more effective than other formulations with regard to long-term results [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/references/\">Zhang, 2016</a>]. However, the authors concluded that future studies that are adequately powered, large-scale, and well-designed are needed to provide higher-quality evidence for the management of oral candidiasis (17 trials were included in this review, but most were considered to have a high or moderate level of bias).</li><li>Oral candidal infection is uncommon in older children, so there is a lack of direct evidence from RCTs in this group. However, the use of miconazole oral gel is supported by pharmacological principles, historical use, and extrapolation of clinical data from trials in younger children and infants (in whom oral candidal infection is common because their immune system is immature).<ul><li>The Summary of Product Characteristics for miconazole oral gel [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/references/\">ABPI, 2015</a>] states that use in children aged under 4 months is contraindicated. However, the BNF for Children [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/references/\">BNF for Children, 2017</a>] does not list this as a contraindication and states that use in children aged under 4 months or during the first 5–6 months of life of an infant born pre-term is unlicensed, and provides dosage information for neonates.  </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Nystatin</strong> suspension is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is applied locally to the mouth for treating local fungal infections [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/references/\">BNF 72, 2016</a>]. <ul><li>It is not suitable as first-line treatment because two comparative RCTs found that it is not as effective as topical miconazole in the treatment of infants with oral candidal infection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/references/\">Hoppe and Hahn, 1996</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/references/\">Hoppe, 1997b</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Lifestyle advice</h5><ul><li>These recommendations are based on the fact that poor dental hygiene and inhaled corticosteroids are risk factors for oral candidiasis. See the section on <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/background-information/causes-risk-factors/\">Risk factors</a> for more information.</li></ul><h5>Managing treatment failure</h5><ul><li>About 85% of infants experience clinical cure with miconazole after 1 week, increasing to 99% after 2 weeks [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/references/\">Hoppe, 1997b</a>]. Therefore, it is worth considering an additional week of treatment if the initial course is not fully effective.</li><li>If miconazole has proved ineffective, it could be due to the presence of a resistant candidal organism (such as <em>Candida glabrata </em>or <em>C. krusei</em>). Nystatin has a broader spectrum of antimycotic activity than miconazole and may be an effective alternative [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/references/\">Samaranayake et al, 2009</a>].</li></ul><h5>Referral</h5><ul><li>The BNF recommends referral for investigation if candidal infection fails to respond to 1–2 weeks of antifungal treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/references/\">BNF 72, 2016</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article is that oral candidal infection that becomes chronic in an infant or child is unusual and requires further assessment by a specialist. Treatment options that may be suitable for initiation in secondary care include oral fluconazole [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/references/\">Samaranayake et al, 2009</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to refer or seek specialist advice if there is suspicion of immunocompromise is based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><h5>Treatment not recommended</h5><ul><li><strong>Oral fluconazole</strong> is not recommended for use in children without seeking specialist advice because it is extensively absorbed and has the potential for adverse effects [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/references/\">Samaranayake et al, 2009</a>]. Expert opinion in a review article is that the use of fluconazole in children is generally felt to be unnecessary for what is considered to be a minor illness [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-oral/references/\">Su et al, 2008</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field 3e5e0927-f892-4485-8342-58f22fc1a07f --><!-- end item 4e341c15-6980-48f2-8511-1923588bdc59 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
