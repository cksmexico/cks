However, if mucosal barriers are disrupted or defences lowered, it can cause infections ranging from non-life threatening superficial mucocutaneous disorders to invasive disseminated disease involving multiple organs. </li><li>Oral candidiasis is most commonly caused by <em>Candida albicans</em>.</li><li>There are different types of oral candidiasis, including pseudomembranous candidiasis (often called oral thrush [which commonly affects neonates]), denture stomatitis (which commonly affects denture wearers), and chronic plaque-like candidiasis (which commonly occurs in men older than 30 years of age, and smokers).</li><li>Comorbidities that increase the risk of candidal infections include diabetes mellitus, severe anaemia, and immunocompromise (such as due to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, HIV infection, and AIDS). Other risk factors include poor dental hygiene; local trauma; smoking; the use of broad spectrum antibiotics, or inhaled or oral corticosteroids; and malnutrition.</li><li>Admission to hospital should be arranged if there is widespread infection (such as oesophageal candidiasis characterized by difficulty or pain on swallowing, or retrosternal pain), or the person is systemically unwell.</li><li>If treating an immunocompetent person, a topical antifungal should be prescribed for 7 days.<ul><li>Miconazole oral gel is recommended first-line for children aged 4 months and over (unlicensed for use in a child aged younger than 4 months, or 5–6 months for an infant born pre-term). Care should be taken when applying the gel to the mouth of infants and young children due to the risk of choking.</li><li>If miconazole oral gel is unsuitable, nystatin suspension (unlicensed for use in neonates) should be offered.</li></ul></li><li>If topical treatment is ineffective, infection is extensive or severe, or the person is significantly immunocompromised: <ul><li>For people aged 16 years and older, oral fluconazole should be prescribed for 7 days after which response to treatment should be reviewed. If the infection has not completely resolved, consideration should be given to treating with oral fluconazole for a further 7 days (referral should be arranged if the infection persists after this); swabbing to identify the causative organism; seeking specialist advice, or arranging referral to a dermatologist. Clinical judgement should be used, taking into account the severity of infection (there should be a low threshold for early referral if infection is severe), the level of immunocompromise, and the response to treatment. </li><li>For children younger than 16 years of age, or if fluconazole is contraindicated, specialist advice should be sought.</li></ul></li><li>People taking immunosuppressive treatment or people who are HIV positive often need more intensive treatment.</li><li>Referral should also be arranged, or specialist advice sought, if:<ul><li>The person has recurrent episodes of oral candidiasis.</li><li>The person has breakthrough candidal infection while receiving preventive treatment (which may indicate candidal resistance).</li><li>There is doubt about the diagnosis. </li></ul></li><li>Referral for biopsy should be considered for people with chronic plaque-like candidiasis which is unresponsive to treatment, as it carries a risk of malignancy.</li></ul><!-- end field 0e8d2319-5ea6-451f-9774-ce66dc0951ec --><!-- end item 3a6814df-0e3d-47ff-aca7-9a67370d194f -->","topic":{"id":"0f1d88eb-55a0-530e-a259-eb14f0dda14a","topicId":"b0c376a4-6364-437c-b2b0-0b37c1f9457c","topicName":"Candida -
