It is associated with atopic conditions and psoriasis, and is characterized by central erythema caused by atrophy of the filiform papillae, and surrounding (slightly elevated) white-yellow borders.</li><li><strong>Hairy tongue </strong>— accumulation of excess keratin on the filiform papillae of the dorsal tongue, leading to the formation of elongated strands that look like hair. The colour of the tongue can range from white or tan to black. It occurs most commonly in smokers, people with poor oral hygiene, and people who overuse mouthwashes.</li><li><strong>Leukoplakia </strong>— a white patch or plaque on the mucosa that cannot be rubbed off. It may be caused by chronic exposure to irritants (particularly tobacco) or chronic infection (particularly oral candidal infection). It is most commonly a benign condition, but may be premalignant.</li><li><strong>Lichen planus</strong> — an inflammatory condition that affects 1–2% of adults. There are two main types: <ul><li>Reticular lichen planus is characterized by bilateral, asymptomatic, white, lacy, striations (or papules) on the posterior buccal mucosa. This form is easily identifiable and does not usually require further investigation.</li><li>Erosive lichen planus manifests as zones of tender erythema and painful ulcers surrounded by white, radiating striae, and may require biopsy to rule out serious causes.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Oral cancers, including:</strong><ul><li><strong>Squamous cell carcinoma </strong>— early lesions are often asymptomatic, appear as areas of erythroplakia (red patch) or leukoplakia (white patch), and may be ulcerated or exophytic (growing outwards). As the lesion grows, it becomes more symptomatic.</li><li><strong>Melanoma </strong>— the oral mucosa is primarily involved in less than 1% of melanomas. Lesions are largely macular, but may be nodular or pedunculated. The pigmentation varies from dark brown to blue-black; however, mucosa-coloured and white lesions may be seen, and erythema is observed when the lesions are inflamed. The palate and maxillary gingiva are involved in about 80% of people, but buccal mucosa, mandibular gingiva, and tongue lesions are also identified.<ul><li>An amalgam tattoo<strong> </strong>(an iatrogenic lesion caused by traumatic implantation of dental amalgam into soft tissue) can sometimes be mistaken for melanoma. It is the most common localized pigmented lesion in the mouth.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Kaposi's sarcoma</strong> — discoloured patches, and occasionally nodules, that are usually red or purple and look similar to bruises.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field bc9cc66f-a09a-471b-a362-a8ae62ce507e --><!-- end item 9166736f-2d98-4550-8eb6-4272d13a1222 -->","topic":{"id":"0f1d88eb-55a0-530e-a259-eb14f0dda14a","topicId":"b0c376a4-6364-437c-b2b0-0b37c1f9457c","topicName":"Candida -
