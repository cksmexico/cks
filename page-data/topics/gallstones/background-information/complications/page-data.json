These include:<ul><li><strong>Biliary colic </strong>— this is pain caused by the gallbladder, cystic duct, or common bile duct contracting around a gallstone. It is, by far, the most common complication of gallstones. Repeated bouts of biliary colic may develop and it often precedes other complications.<ul><li>The rates of gallstone related complications are higher in people with a history of uncomplicated biliary colic. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Acute cholecystitis </strong>(0.3-0.4% annually in asymptomatic gallstone carriers) — this occurs when obstruction of the cystic duct leads to gallbladder inflammation. It is the second most common complication of gallstones. Acute infective cholecystitis may progress to more severe infection, perforation or fistula formation. </li><li><strong>Acute pancreatitis</strong> (0.04-1.5% annually in asymptomatic gallstone carriers) — this occurs when a stone that has migrated along the common bile duct becomes stuck in the biliopancreatic duct causing pancreatic outflow obstruction, and can be life threatening. </li><li><strong>Obstructive jaundice </strong>(0.1-0.4% annually in asymptomatic gallstone carriers) — a partially or completely blocked common bile duct causes an accumulation of bile pigments in the bloodstream. The obstruction is caused most commonly by a stone that has passed from the gallbladder into the bile duct. Rarely, it is due to compression of the common bile duct or the common hepatic duct by a stone in the neck of the gallbladder or cystic duct (Mirizzi syndrome).</li><li><strong>All other complications are uncommon or rare, </strong>and include:<ul><li><strong>Acute cholangitis (also called ascending cholangitis)</strong> — this occurs when there is complete obstruction of the bile duct resulting in cholestasis and infected bile which can be life threatening. </li><li><strong>Fistula formation </strong>— if a gallstone erodes through the<strong> </strong>gallbladder a fistula can develop causing duodenal obstruction (Bouveret's syndrome). Erosion of a stone into the common bile duct produces a biliary fistula (a form of Mirizzi syndrome), and if it occurs in the ileum it is known as gallstone ileus. </li><li><strong>Biliary peritonitis. </strong></li><li><strong>Gallbladder mucocele. </strong></li><li><strong>Gallbladder cancer </strong>— there is an association between gallstones and cancer of the biliary tract, however, no causative link has been established.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gallstones/references/\">Sanders and Kingsnorth, 2007</a>;
