href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Aboyans et al, 2018</a>].</li><li>NICE accepts that the provision of supervised exercise programmes is variable and NHS funding may not be available [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>]. A more recent Cochrane systematic review notes that widespread implementation is also restricted by lack of facilities [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Hageman et al, 2018</a>]. <ul><li>Supervised exercise was defined by NICE as 'community-based exercise including hospital or gym-based exercise programmes supervised by healthcare professionals'. This usually consists of around 2 hours of classes per week for up to 3 months in which exercise is undertaken until symptoms of intermittent claudication developed. Exercise is repeated after a period of rest [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>]. </li></ul></li><li>European guidelines recommend unsupervised exercise training for intermittent claudication when supervised exercise training is not feasible or available [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Aboyans et al, 2018</a>]. North American guidelines suggest a home-based exercise programme involving 30 minutes of walking three to five times a week if accessing a supervised exercise programme is not possible [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Conte et al, 2015</a>].<ul><li>The NICE GDG also accepts that some people may not be motivated to undertake a supervised exercise programme and noted that some people may prefer advice and instruction about unsupervised exercise. For the purposes of their evidence review NICE defined unsupervised exercise as 'advice to exercise for around 30 minutes three to five times a week, walking until symptoms develop and then resting to recover' [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>].</li></ul></li><li>A Cochrane systematic review was undertaken on exercise for intermittent claudication (search date November 2016) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Lane et al, 2017</a>]. <ul><li>A meta-analysis of high-quality data from nine studies (n = 391) concluded that, compared with no exercise, exercise improved pain-free walking distance (mean difference 82.11m; 95% CI 71.73 to 92.48, p < 0.00001). High quality evidence from 10 studies (n = 500) showed an improvement in maximum walking distance with exercise (mean difference 120.36m; 95% CI 50.79 to 189.92, p < 0.0007). Ankle brachial pressure index was not improved by exercise and no effect of exercise on amputation or mortality was found. </li></ul></li><li>A subsequent Cochrane systematic review (search date December 2016) included 21 randomised controlled trials (n = 1400) comparing supervised exercise therapy with home-based exercise therapy or walking advice for intermittent claudication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Hageman et al, 2018</a>]. <ul><li>The primary outcome measure was the effect on maximal treadmill walking distance or time for each intervention.<ul><li>Supervised exercise therapy provided a greater improvement in maximal walking distance or time compared with home-based exercise therapy and walking advice (moderate and high quality evidence). Home-based exercise showed no improvement compared with walking advice in terms of mean walking distance and time (moderate quality evidence).</li><li>A difference in maximal walking distance of around 120 metres in favour of supervised exercise therapy compared with home-based exercise therapy after 3 months of treatment was calculated. The difference in walking distance between supervised exercise therapy and walking advice groups after this time was approximately 210 metres.</li></ul></li><li>Secondary outcomes included pain-free walking distance or time, quality of life, and functional impairment — favourable results were obtained for supervised exercise compared with home-based exercise therapy or walking advice in terms of pain-free walking distance or time.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Referral for consideration of angioplasty or bypass surgery</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is extrapolated from the NICE guideline <em style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis and management </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">NICE, 2012b</a>]. The NICE guideline development group concluded that if people require additional interventions after attempting supervised exercise, an endovascular procedure is preferred due to the lower risks and cost compared with surgery, but that in cases unsuitable for endovascular procedures, surgery can be considered [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>]. More recent European guidelines recommend consideration of revascularization in people with intermittent claudication if daily life activities are adversely affected despite exercise therapy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Aboyans et al, 2018</a>].</li><li>Referral to a vascular surgeon is recommended for people with claudication affecting quality of life that does not improve after a 3-month course of supervised exercise therapy, by a UK clinical update [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Morley et al, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Naftidrofuryl oxalate </h5><ul><li>This recommendation reflects the NICE guideline <em>Peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis and management </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">NICE, 2012b</a>] and is based on the consensus of the NICE GDG who considered evidence in a NICE technology appraisal [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">NICE, 2011</a>]. The NICE GDG found no evidence comparing naftidrofuryl with exercise therapy, angioplasty, or stents for the treatment of intermittent claudication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>]. <ul><li>The conclusions of the technology appraisal were that naftidrofuryl oxalate improves maximal walking distance (by 60.3%) and pain-free walking distance (by 64.2%) when compared with placebo. Naftidrofuryl also showed a greater increase in these measures than cilostazol and pentoxifylline when compared with placebo [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">NICE, 2011</a>]. </li><li>The NICE GDG also acknowledged that some people may not want referral or other treatments and therefore wish to try naftidrofuryl. In situations when best medical treatment has failed and the person does not want to consider an exercise programme or interventional treatment, the GDG considered naftidrofuryl oxalate to be a cost-effective option [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>]. </li></ul></li><li>Evidence from a Cochrane systematic review of 7 RCTs (search date October 2012) showed a 37% improvement in pain-free walking distance with naftidrofuryl compared with placebo (ratio of relative improvement 1.37; 95% CI 1.27 to 1.49, p < 0.001). The data enabled the calculation of a number needed to treat of 4.5 for naftidrofuryl oxalate [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">de Backer, 2012</a>]. <ul><li>The Cochrane authors concluded that, in terms of improving walking distance in people with intermittent claudication in the first 6 months of treatment, naftidrofuryl has a statistically significant and moderate clinically meaningful effect.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Advice on peripheral arterial disease</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the NICE guideline <em>Peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis and management </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">NICE, 2012b</a>], which advocates the provision of individually tailored information to enable a person to share decision making, improve their understanding of the condition, and help themselves to prevent disease progression.</li></ul><h5>Advice on driving</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is in line with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) publication <em>Assessing fitness to drive: a guide for medical professionals </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">DVLA, 2019</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field 0b296b0f-a8f0-428c-91c7-51afda50671d --><!-- end item 999c2e0b-3e7d-4ce3-8f4f-c82b797e41f1 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"0675dbd8-e8d0-59fc-b96d-c0c919726e78","slug":"managing-cardiovascular-risk","fullItemName":"Managing cardiovascular risk","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 371d25a6-43dc-4b15-93c3-299db8ce662b --><h3>How should I manage cardiovascular risk?</h3><!-- end field 371d25a6-43dc-4b15-93c3-299db8ce662b -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 521c9c2d-ed92-402e-9b81-2913b808ca38 --><!-- begin field 98e4f34c-68fe-4106-b2b8-afb005d93c4e --><ul><li><strong>Assess for previously undiagnosed cardiovascular conditions or risk factors and manage appropriately.</strong><ul><li>For more information about managing cardiovascular risk, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/cvd-risk-assessment-management/\">CVD risk assessment and management</a>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Offer all people with peripheral arterial disease information, advice, support, and treatment regarding the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.</strong><ul><li>For more detailed information, particularly in relation to:<ul><li>Smoking cessation — see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/smoking-cessation/\">Smoking cessation</a>.</li><li>Diet, weight management, and exercise — see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/obesity/\">Obesity</a>.</li><li>Lipid modification and statin therapy — see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/lipid-modification-cvd-prevention/\">Lipid modification - CVD prevention</a>.</li><li>The prevention, diagnosis, and management of diabetes — see the CKS topics on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/\">Diabetes - type 1</a> and <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-2/\">Diabetes - type 2</a>.</li><li>The prevention, diagnosis, and management of high blood pressure — see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypertension-not-diabetic/\">Hypertension - not diabetic</a>.</li><li>Antiplatelet therapy — see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/antiplatelet-treatment/\">Antiplatelet treatment</a>.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 98e4f34c-68fe-4106-b2b8-afb005d93c4e --><!-- end item 521c9c2d-ed92-402e-9b81-2913b808ca38 -->","subChapters":[{"id":"6013b58f-59b8-5690-8362-8930514fbdc0","slug":"basis-for-recommendation-d2d","fullItemName":"Basis for recommendation","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field af1f0bbc-f145-421b-b7bc-1818214173b7 --><h4>Basis for recommendation</h4><!-- end field af1f0bbc-f145-421b-b7bc-1818214173b7 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item d2d708b2-773e-46ed-bd09-12619976cc0e --><!-- begin field 0cda1a63-7e10-4a4e-ba34-73c0f1c1d1ec --><h5>Approach to management</h5><ul><li>UK, European, North American, and international guidelines emphasise the importance of cardiovascular risk factor management for people with peripheral arterial disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">NICE, 2012b</a>;

Even people with asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease are at risk of progression to critical limb ischaemia [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Cea-Soriano et al, 2018</a>].  </li><li>CKS does not recommend formal cardiovascular risk assessment because any person with peripheral arterial disease already has established cardiovascular disease, therefore is considered to be at high risk [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Joint Formulary Committee, 2019</a>]. </li><li>For more information on the evidence for modifying risk factors to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/cvd-risk-assessment-management/\">CVD risk assessment and management</a>.</li></ul><h5>Smoking</h5><ul><li>Smoking cessation is a vital part of care for people with peripheral arterial disease who are still smoking and they should be advised to quit [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Gerhard-Herman et al, 2017</a>].  </li><li>Smoking cessation reduces cardiovascular risk. Excess cardiovascular risk is halved within one year of cessation, and risk is the same as for a non-smoker within 5 years of quitting. There is a lack of evidence specifically on the impact of smoking cessation on peripheral arterial disease of the limb, but observational studies suggest benefit in terms of walking distance and amputation rates [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>]. Smoking cessation (in conjunction with regular exercise) demonstrates the most noticeable improvement in walking distance in people with intermittent claudication, particularly those with distal disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Aboyans et al, 2018</a>]. </li><li>Outcomes for people with peripheral artery disease that continue smoking are persistently worse, with an increased likelihood of claudication and critical limb ischaemia, and a two-fold increased risk of limb amputation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Foley et al, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Morley et al, 2018</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Diet, weight management, and exercise</h5><ul><li>Diet and weight management are recommended as strategies to manage cardiovascular risk factors in people with peripheral arterial disease by UK, European, and international guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">NICE, 2012b</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Aboyans et al, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Conte et al, 2015</a>].</li><li>Exercise has proven cardiovascular benefit [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>].

Evidence also suggests that statins may have a role in stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>]. Statin therapy also improves limb outcomes in people with peripheral arterial disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Gerhard-Herman et al, 2017</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Diabetes</h5><ul><li>North American guidelines advocate regular follow up and communication between the healthcare providers of a person with diabetes mellitus and peripheral arterial disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Gerhard-Herman et al, 2017</a>].  </li><li>In people with diabetes and peripheral arterial disease there is an increased risk of adverse outcomes (for example progression to critical limb ischaemia and amputation) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Gerhard-Herman et al, 2017</a>].  </li><li>The incidence and prevalence of peripheral arterial disease increases with the duration of type 1 and type 2 diabetes [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>]. There is evidence that glycaemic control is particularly important for people with diabetes mellitus and peripheral arterial disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Gerhard-Herman et al, 2017</a>]. The treatment of diabetes may reduce the risk of microvascular disease and neuropathy, which is particularly relevant to people with peripheral arterial disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Kullo and Rooke, 2016</a>]. <strong> </strong></li></ul><h5>Hypertension</h5><ul><li>Management of hypertension lowers cardiovascular risk [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Morley et al, 2018</a>].  </li><li>Hypertension is associated with a three-fold increased risk of peripheral arterial disease, and there is evidence that treatment of hypertension reduces the rate of stroke and cardiovascular deaths [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>]. Despite the strong association between hypertension and cardiovascular disease, including peripheral arterial disease, the relative risk is not as great as for smoking or diabetes [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Conte et al, 2015</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Antiplatelet agents</h5><ul><li>Antiplatelets lessen the risk of major cardiovascular events [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Morley et al, 2018</a>]. </li><li>Antiplatelet agents (largely aspirin) were found in a meta-analysis to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events by 23% in people with peripheral arterial disease. Evidence from another study found clopidogrel further reduces cardiovascular events compared to aspirin, especially in people with peripheral arterial disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>].</li><li>For more information on the evidence for antiplatelet drugs in people with peripheral arterial disease, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/antiplatelet-treatment/\">Antiplatelet treatment</a>.</li></ul><!-- end field 0cda1a63-7e10-4a4e-ba34-73c0f1c1d1ec --><!-- end item d2d708b2-773e-46ed-bd09-12619976cc0e -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
