with critical limb ischaemia to a vascular multidisciplinary team is extrapolated from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline <em>Peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis and management </em>which states 'ensure all people with critical limb ischaemia are assessed by a vascular multidisciplinary team before treatment decisions are made'. This is because people with critical limb ischaemia are at risk of irreversible ischaemic damage to the leg or foot without appropriate treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">NICE, 2012b</a>]. This is supported by a subsequent recommendation from international experts to refer people with suspected chronic limb-threatening ischaemia to a vascular specialist [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Conte et al, 2019</a>]. CKS has suggested <em>urgent</em> referral on the basis of expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Morley et al, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Firnhaber and Powell, 2019</a>] and a previous reviewer of this topic.<ul><li>Global vascular guidelines on the management of chronic limb-threatening ischaemia discuss that although limb salvage should be considered for most people with the condition, it may be appropriate to palliatively treat selected people after shared decision making [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Conte et al, 2019</a>]. </li></ul></li><li>Secondary care interventions which can be used to treat critical limb ischaemia include surgical revascularization by bypass, or endovascular treatments such as balloon angioplasty or stenting [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Setacci et al, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Shishehbor et al, 2016</a>]. In people presenting to vascular surgeons with a new diagnosis of chronic limb-threatening ischaemia [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Barraclough and Bradbury, 2018</a>]: <ul><li>Conservative treatment with non-surgical therapy is offered to 20%.</li><li>Revascularization is offered to 65% (bypass in 25% and endovascular interventions in 40%).</li></ul></li><li>In people for whom revascularization may not be possible, or is unsuccessful, amputation may be the next step. In some cases (such as if attempts at angioplasty or bypass are unlikely to be successful) it may be in the person's best interests to proceed straight to amputation to avoid unnecessary discomfort and delay in recovery [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>]. Primary amputation is offered to around 15% of people presenting with a new diagnosis of chronic limb-threatening ischaemia [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Barraclough and Bradbury, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Pain management</h5><ul><li>This recommendation reflects the NICE guideline <em>Peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis and management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">NICE, 2012b</a>], and is based on the opinion of the NICE guideline development group (GDG) who considered the adverse effects of analgesic drugs and concluded that a tiered approach to pain management would ensure adequate pain relief, should minimize adverse effects, and is most cost effective. This is consistent with the approach used for a number of other painful conditions such as low back pain and osteoarthritis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>].<ul><li>International expert opinion in more recent global vascular guidelines on the management of people with chronic limb-threatening ischaemia also advocates a tiered approach, using paracetamol in combination with opioids, with analgesia being proportional to the severity of pain. Pain control is important in this group because uncontrolled pain can have a significant effect on function and quality of life [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Conte et al, 2019</a>]. </li><li>The recommendation on prescribers needing to be competent and experienced in the use of strong opioids is based on a 2019 update to the SIGN guideline <em>Management of chronic pain</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">SIGN, 2013</a>].</li></ul></li><li>NICE acknowledged that neuropathic pain may sometimes be associated with critical limb ischaemia. However, no RCTs or observational studies comparing opioids, gabapentin, pregabalin, or tricyclic antidepressants with each other for the treatment of pain associated with critical limb ischaemia were identified [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>].</li></ul><h5>Referral to a specialist pain management service</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the expert opinion of the NICE GDG in an evidence review comissioned by NICE. The NICE GDG concluded that for people with a requirement for strong analgesics or poorly managed pain, the cost of specialist treatment would be justified by the possibility of an improvement in quality of life [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>]. </li><li>Early referral to a pain management service if pain is not controlled by opioids is recommended by more recent global vascular guidelines on the management of people with chronic limb-threatening ischaemia [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Conte et al, 2019</a>]. A guideline from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network on chronic pain management also recommends referral to a specialist pain service if there is an inadequate response to non-specialist management [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">SIGN, 2013</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Advice</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the NICE guideline <em>Peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis and management </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">NICE, 2012b</a>], which advocates the provision of individually tailored information to enable a person to share decision making, improve their understanding of the condition, and help themselves to prevent disease progression.</li><li>The recommendation on foot care is based on expert opinion in the Oxford Textbook of Medicine [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Powell and Davies, 2010</a>] and North American guidelines that give advice for minimising tissue loss in people with peripheral artery disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Gerhard-Herman et al, 2017</a>]. </li><li>The recommendation on driving is in line with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) publication <em>Assessing fitness to drive: a guide for medical professionals</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">DVLA, 2019</a>]. </li></ul><!-- end field c42ff29e-e808-44eb-87cc-cec6bd2ca8be --><!-- end item 58610b9c-7acc-4250-92dd-c806bdc29267 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"0a38ae76-6247-58d3-804b-5d620cfc3270","slug":"managing-cardiovascular-risk","fullItemName":"Managing cardiovascular risk","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 246e4256-d018-4a2f-afed-5d23c4aed0d9 --><h3>How should I manage cardiovascular risk?</h3><!-- end field 246e4256-d018-4a2f-afed-5d23c4aed0d9 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 4a54308f-853e-4528-9001-14b247c22575 --><!-- begin field f6efbadf-0bdd-4a34-b8d4-de2f8cca624e --><ul><li><strong>Assess for previously undiagnosed cardiovascular conditions or risk factors and manage appropriately.</strong><ul><li>For more information on managing cardiovascular risk, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/cvd-risk-assessment-management/\">CVD risk assessment and management</a>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Offer all people with peripheral arterial disease information, advice, support, and treatment regarding the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. </strong><ul><li>For more detailed information, particularly in relation to:<ul><li>Smoking cessation — see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/smoking-cessation/\">Smoking cessation</a>.</li><li>Diet, weight management, and exercise — see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/obesity/\">Obesity</a>.</li><li>Lipid modification and statin therapy — see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/lipid-modification-cvd-prevention/\">Lipid modification -

There is a lack of evidence specifically on the impact of smoking cessation on peripheral arterial disease of the limb, but observational studies suggest benefit in terms of walking distance and amputation rates [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>].</li><li>Outcomes for people with peripheral artery disease that continue smoking are persistently worse, with an increased likelihood of claudication and critical limb ischaemia, and a two-fold increased risk of limb amputation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Foley et al, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Morley et al, 2018</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Diet, weight management, and exercise</h5><ul><li>Diet and weight management are recommended as strategies to manage cardiovascular risk factors in people with peripheral arterial disease by UK, European, and international guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">NICE, 2012b</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Aboyans et al, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Conte et al, 2019</a>].  </li><li>Exercise has proven cardiovascular benefit [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>].</li></ul><h5>Lipid modification</h5><ul><li>In people with atherosclerosis, treatment of dyslipidaemia lessens the likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Conte et al, 2015</a>].  </li><li>Evidence shows that lowering cholesterol with a statin reduces cardiovascular events in people with peripheral arterial disease. Evidence also suggests that statins may have a role in stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>]. Statin therapy also improves limb outcomes in people with peripheral arterial disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Gerhard-Herman et al, 2017</a>].</li></ul><h5>Diabetes</h5><ul><li>North American guidelines advocate regular follow up and communication between the healthcare providers of a person with diabetes mellitus and peripheral arterial disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Gerhard-Herman et al, 2017</a>].  </li><li>In people with diabetes and peripheral arterial disease, there is an increased risk of adverse outcomes (for example progression to critical limb ischaemia and amputation) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Gerhard-Herman et al, 2017</a>].  </li><li>The incidence and prevalence of peripheral arterial disease increases with the duration of type 1 and type 2 diabetes [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>]. There is evidence that glycaemic control is particularly important for people with diabetes mellitus and peripheral arterial disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Gerhard-Herman et al, 2017</a>]. The treatment of diabetes may reduce the risk of microvascular disease and neuropathy, which is particularly relevant to people with peripheral arterial disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Kullo and Rooke, 2016</a>]. <strong> </strong></li></ul><h5>Hypertension</h5><ul><li>Management of hypertension lowers cardiovascular risk [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Morley et al, 2018</a>].</li><li>Hypertension is associated with a three-fold increased risk of peripheral arterial disease, and there is evidence that treatment of hypertension reduces the rate of stroke and cardiovascular deaths [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>]. Despite the strong association between hypertension and cardiovascular disease, including peripheral arterial disease, the relative risk is not as great as for smoking or diabetes [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Conte et al, 2015</a>].</li></ul><h5>Antiplatelet agents</h5><ul><li>Antiplatelets lessen the risk of major cardiovascular events [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Morley et al, 2018</a>].  </li><li>Antiplatelet agents (largely aspirin) were found in a meta-analysis to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events by 23% in people with peripheral arterial disease. Evidence from another study found clopidogrel further reduces cardiovascular events compared to aspirin, especially in people with peripheral arterial disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>]. </li><li>For more information on the evidence for antiplatelet drugs in people with peripheral arterial disease, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/antiplatelet-treatment/\">Antiplatelet treatment</a>.</li></ul><!-- end field aed2ba5f-ac6d-47dc-94de-d265ef7bcec8 --><!-- end item 816b1149-0178-4b55-b091-65bd5f8f70c2 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
