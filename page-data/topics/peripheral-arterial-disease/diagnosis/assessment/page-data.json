The guideline development group (GDG) were of the opinion that the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease should be made on the basis of history, examination and ABPI measurement, with the caveat that clinical judgement should be used as even this combination is not always accurate [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>].</li></ul><h4>History and examination</h4><ul><li>The features of history and examination for people with suspected peripheral arterial disease are based on the NICE guideline <em>Peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis and management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">NICE, 2012b</a>], subsequent North American guidelines on lower extremity peripheral artery disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Gerhard-Herman et al, 2017</a>], international consensus guidelines on chronic limb-threatening ischaemia [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Conte et al, 2019</a>] and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Wennberg, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Kullo and Rooke, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Santistevan, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Barraclough and Bradbury, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Farber, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Morley et al, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Firnhaber and Powell, 2019</a>]. </li></ul><h4>Measuring ABPI</h4><ul><li>This recommendation reflects the NICE guideline <em>Peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis and management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">NICE, 2012b</a>], and is based on consensus from the experience of the NICE GDG, who noted that [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>]:  <ul><li>The person should be supine where possible when measuring ABPI because it equalises the blood pressure in the brachial and lower limb arteries.</li><li>It is important to choose an appropriately sized cuff for the lower limb because if the cuff size is incorrect it may result in an incorrect ABPI measurement.</li><li>The recommended frequency range of the Doppler probe to measure peripheral vessels is 7–10 MHz.</li><li>An attempt should be made to measure all three arteries in the foot as some people (for example those with diabetes) may only have a pulse in the peroneal artery.</li><li>ABPI should be measured in people with tissue loss (ulceration and/or gangrene) or painful limbs, but it should be noted that falsely elevated ankle pressures can be obtained in people with renal failure or diabetes.</li></ul></li><li>More recent European, North American, and global guidelines also recommend measuring the ankle-brachial pressure index in people with suspected peripheral arterial disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Conte et al, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Aboyans et al, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Conte et al, 2019</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion from previous reviewers of this CKS topic emphasized the need for an experienced operator using validated equipment to measure the ABPI to avoid errors or false diagnosis of absent Doppler signals. European guidelines also note that good training is mandatory [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Aboyans et al, 2018</a>]. </li></ul><h4>Consideration of acute limb ischaemia</h4><ul><li>Expert opinion in an evidence summary describes an absence of pulse in the lower extremity on Doppler ultrasound as a sign of acute limb ischaemia [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2018</a>]. In this situation the ABPI cannot be calculated [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Santistevan, 2017</a>].<ul><li>Recommended standards for reports dealing with lower extremity ischaemia [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Rutherford et al, 1997</a>]<strong> </strong>and review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Jaffery et al, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">McNally and Univers, 2018</a>] state that an inaudible arterial Doppler signal is a sign of a threatened limb, which at best is salvageable if promptly treated and at worst is irreversibly damaged.</li><li>Expert opinion in review articles advises consultation with a vascular surgery unit, on an emergency basis, in the absence of palpable pulses or audible arterial Doppler signal [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Brearley, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Santistevan, 2017</a>]. CKS has advised seeking immediate specialist advice on this basis of this and expert opinion from previous reviewers of this CKS topic which suggests that if symptoms and signs are also taken into account and indicate the possibility of acute limb ischaemia, immediate specialist advice should be sought as emergency referral may be required.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Interpreting ABPI values</h4><ul><li>This recommendation is based on guidelines from NICE [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>] and the European Society of Cardiology and European Society for Vascular Surgery [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Aboyans et al, 2018</a>]. </li><li>In terms of sensitivity and negative predictive values, an ABPI of less than 0.9 is recommended as the best indicator for peripheral arterial disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>].<strong> </strong>ABPI of this value has a 75% sensitivity and 86% specificity to diagnose lower extremity artery disease (lower in people with diabetes) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Aboyans et al, 2018</a>]. The NICE full guideline states that 'various definitions and classifications often use ABPI as an indicator of disease severity, with the use of a threshold value for ABPI of below 0.5 for critical limb ischaemia and less than 0.9 for peripheral arterial disease'. It notes, however, that some people (for example those with diabetes mellitus, who may have significantly impaired circulation, non-healing ulceration or infection and be at high risk of limb loss) do not always match these definitions of ABPI [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012</a>]. <ul><li>The recommendation to seek advice if there is doubt about the diagnosis is based on expert opinion in review articles on peripheral arterial disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Firnhaber and Powell, 2019</a>] and chronic limb-threatening ischaemia [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Barraclough and Bradbury, 2018</a>]. <ul><li>Exercise ABPI testing may be used for people in whom the diagnosis is uncertain on the basis of examination and resting ABPI (for example normal resting ABPI despite exertional claudication) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Conte et al, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Firnhaber and Powell, 2019</a>]. </li><li>Measurement of ABPI may not be as useful in chronic limb-threatening ischaemia as for intermittent claudication and should not be used to determine referral in primary care if chronic limb-threatening ischaemia cannot be confidently excluded on the basis of vascular history and clinical examination. Signals may be difficult to hear and could be from collateral vessels, and pressure measurements may be falsely raised because the arterial wall is calcified [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Barraclough and Bradbury, 2018</a>].</li></ul></li><li>European guidelines note that ABPI values of more than 1.4 may indicate arterial stiffening (medial arterial calcification) which is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and is more common with increased age and in people with diabetes or chronic kidney disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Aboyans et al, 2018</a>]. The NICE guideline on <em>Peripheral arterial disease: diagnosis and management </em>added a recommendation in 2018 that diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease should not be excluded in people with diabetes based on a normal or raised ankle brachial pressure index alone. Hardening of the arteries in people with diabetes and peripheral arterial disease may result in a normal or raised index [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">NICE, 2012b</a>]. <ul><li>CKS has pragmatically made the recommendation to consider the possibility of peripheral arterial disease if the ABPI is high (1.4 or more) taking into account other symptoms and signs and to seek specialist advice if unsure of the diagnosis.</li><li>A European guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of peripheral arterial diseases mentions toe-brachial index, Doppler waveform analysis, or pulse voulme recording as alternative tests that may be necessary in people with incompressible ankle arteries or ABPI of more than 1.4 [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/peripheral-arterial-disease/references/\">Aboyans et al, 2018</a>].  </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 4b7020fd-93c2-4828-bbd4-aaa900a699bd --><!-- end item c0b44adf-f362-4c40-b44b-aaa900a6981b -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
