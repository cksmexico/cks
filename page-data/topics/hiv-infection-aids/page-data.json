cells of the immune system, in particular the CD4 cells (a class of T lymphocyte).</li><li>HIV can be transmitted from infected body fluids:<ul><li>Through sexual activity.</li><li>Vertically from mother to child — during pregnancy, childbirth, or through breastfeeding.</li><li>By inoculation — via a contaminated needle, instrument, blood, or blood product; through direct exposure of mucous membranes or an open wound to infected bodily fluids; or by a human bite that breaks the skin.</li></ul></li><li>Primary HIV infection (PHI) or HIV seroconversion illness often presents with a flu-like illness in the first few weeks following infection and can be mild or severe.<ul><li>The person is highly infectious during PHI.</li></ul></li><li>Progression of HIV infection involves:<ul><li>An asymptomatic stage once symptoms of PHI resolve — some people progress rapidly to advanced HIV infection or AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) within 1–2 years, while others may remain immunocompetent more than 10 years later.</li><li>Advanced HIV infection occurs when the number of CD4 cells is very low (less than 200 cells per microlitre) and certain opportunistic infections (such as pneumocystis pneumonia) or malignancies (such as Kaposi’s sarcoma) develop.</li></ul></li><li>The possibility of HIV infection should be considered whenever a person presents with one or more alerting features:<ul><li>Common symptoms or infections that are unusually severe, prolonged, recurrent, or unexplained.</li><li>Persistent enlarged lymph nodes other than in the inguinal area.</li><li>Conditions related to immunosuppression.</li><li>Glandular fever-like illness.</li><li>Lifestyle and social risk factors for contracting HIV, such as living in, working in, or coming from a high prevalence area; men who have sex with men; and injecting drug users.</li></ul></li><li>HIV testing should be offered in primary care:<ul><li>As part of routine antenatal care.</li><li>If the person requests a test, has a risk factor for HIV, or has another sexually transmitted infection.</li><li>To people newly registering at a practice or having a blood test if they have not had an HIV test in the past 12 months, in areas where the prevalence of diagnosed HIV is greater than 2 in 1000.</li><li>To people presenting with symptoms of PHI or longstanding HIV infection.<ul><li>Some HIV-related conditions such as pneumocystis pneumonia or cryptococcal meningitis can be life threatening and require urgent admission or referral to secondary care.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Management of HIV is complex and is carried out by specialist HIV services in secondary care.<ul><li>Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is initiated and monitored in secondary care — ART can be associated with serious or life-threatening adverse effects that may present in primary care.</li><li>ART can also have serious or life-threatening interactions with many drugs commonly prescribed in primary care — before prescribing, drug interactions should be checked in the British National Formulary, the online database of HIV drug interactions, or with an HIV specialist.</li><li>ART has improved the prognosis of HIV/AIDS significantly — people living with HIV who are adherent and clinically responding to ART can expect a normal or near-normal life span.</li></ul></li><li>Potential occupational or sexual exposure to HIV is a medical emergency — urgent referral for consideration of post-exposure prophylaxis is required.</li></ul><!-- end field
