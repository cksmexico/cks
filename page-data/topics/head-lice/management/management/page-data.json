--><ul><li>If a live head louse is <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/head-lice/diagnosis/confirming-active-infestation/\">found</a>, treat with one of the following:<ul><li>A physical insecticide — these silicone or fatty acid ester-based products kill the lice by physically coating their surfaces and suffocating them, so resistance is unlikely to develop.<ul><li>They include dimeticone 4% gel, lotion, or spray (Hedrin<sup>®</sup> Once or Lotion; Chemists' Own<sup>®</sup> Head Lice Spray); dimeticone 92% spray (NYDA<sup>®</sup>); dimeticone > 95% lotion (Linicin<sup>®</sup> Lotion); isopropyl myristate and cyclomethicone solution (Full Marks Solution<sup>®</sup>); and isopropyl myristrate and isopropyl alcohol aerosol (Vamousse<sup>®</sup> Head Lice Treatment), all of which are available on the NHS.</li></ul></li><li>A chemical or traditional insecticide — these poison the lice by chemical means. <ul><li>In the UK, the only chemical insecticide that is currently recommended is Malathion 0.5% aqueous liquid (Derbac-M<sup>®</sup>), but resistance has been reported.</li></ul></li><li>Wet combing — this is the systematic combing of wet hair with a louse detection comb to remove head lice. <ul><li>The Bug Buster<sup>®</sup> kit is the only head lice removal (and detection) method that has been evaluated in randomized controlled trials, and it is available on the NHS. </li><li>Other nit combs listed in the <a href=\"http://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/PrescriptionServices/4940.aspx\" data-hyperlink-id=\"d78c2c72-d7b9-4f01-915c-a98f001574e9\">Drug Tariff</a> include Nitty Gritty NitFree comb<sup>®</sup>, Nitcomb–S1<sup>®</sup>, and Nitcomb–M2<sup>®</sup>.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>The choice of treatment will depend on the preference of the person and/or their parents/carers after considering the <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/head-lice/management/management/#advantages-disadvantages\">advantages and disadvantages</a> of each treatment, what has been previously tried, and the cost of the treatment. Be aware that:<ul><li>Wet combing or dimeticone 4% lotion is recommended first-line for pregnant or breastfeeding women, young children aged 6 months to 2 years, and people with asthma or eczema.</li><li>Shampoos are generally not recommended because they are diluted too much and have an insufficient contact time to kill eggs.</li></ul></li><li>Supply enough treatment to complete a treatment course. <ul><li>In general, a small bottle of insecticide is sufficient for treating short or shoulder-length hair, but a larger bottle or two small bottles would be needed for longer, thicker hair.</li><li>The Bug Buster<sup>®</sup> kit is reusable by a whole family.</li></ul></li><li>Advise the person with head lice and/or their parents/carers to read the instructions that come with the treatment to ensure that it is used safely and correctly. Highlight that:<ul><li>All affected family members should be treated on the same day to avoid reinfection.</li><li>For insecticides:<ul><li>Treatment should be applied to all areas of the scalp and to all of the hairs, from their roots to their tips. </li><li>The product should be left on for the time recommended by the manufacturer, then washed off. This varies from 15 minutes (for example with Hedrin<sup>®</sup> Once Spray Gel and Vamousse<sup>®</sup>) to at least 8 hours (for example with Hedrin<sup>®</sup> Lotion and NYDA<sup>®</sup>). A contact time of 8–12 hours (or overnight) is recommended for lotions and liquids.</li><li>It is generally recommended that insecticides are applied twice, at least 7 days apart, in order to treat any lice hatching from eggs before they lay more eggs themselves. Some experts suggest that 2 applications may be insufficient and that 3 applications may be required to achieve a complete cure.</li><li>Inappropriate use can lead to treatment failure and may increase the risk of resistant lice. </li><li>The hair should be kept away from naked flames, cigarettes, and other sources of ignition during treatment with dimeticone-containing products (though not flammable, dimeticone is not water based and will not prevent hair from burning). Care should be taken if the product is spilt as it may cause a slip hazard.</li></ul></li><li>For wet combing:<ul><li>The recommended regimen is four sessions spaced over 2 weeks (on days 1, 5, 9, and 13).</li><li>It takes about 10 minutes to complete the process on short hair, and 20–30 minutes for long, frizzy, or curly hair. Two combing procedures are recommended at each treatment session.</li><li>Detailed information on wet combing is provided in the Bug Buster<sup>®</sup> kit and is also available on the Community Hygiene Concern website (<a href=\"http://www.chc.org/\" data-hyperlink-id=\"e10b711f-0917-4c3a-8d41-a98f00157565\">www.chc.org</a>). </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Advise that after treatment, detection combing should be done to check that the treatment was successful. <ul><li>For insecticide treatments, opinions differ as to how this should be done. For example:<ul><li>The UK Medicines Information (UKMi) Cymru Wales recommend that detection combing should be done 2 or 3 days after the second application of treatment and again after an interval of 7 days (that is, day 9 or 10 after completing a course of treatment). Treatment has been successful if no lice are found on both occasions.</li><li>Advice from Community Hygiene Concern (<a href=\"http://www.chc.org/homedir/parent_info.cfm\" data-hyperlink-id=\"466e7174-8503-4ea9-a6a2-a98f00157d77\">www.chc.org</a>) is that regardless of the treatment used, detection combing should be done on days 5, 9, and 12/13 after the first application to avoid the risk of continuing infestation. Treatment has been successful if no lice are found on all occasions.</li></ul></li><li>For wet combing, a fifth detection combing session should be done on day 17. Treatment has been successful if no lice are found on day 17.</li><li>Explain that the presence of louse eggs alone (whether hatched [nits] or unhatched) and/or itching do not indicate treatment failure.</li></ul></li><li>Give additional information and advice, including on how to reduce the risk of reinfestation. See the section on <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/head-lice/management/management/#information-advice\">Information and advice</a> for more information.</li></ul><!-- end field 83c8663f-48ba-466e-81c0-91e36d1961e2 --><!-- end item d2dc7c87-15d2-47f8-ae18-ced020fda460 -->","subChapters":[{"id":"f22434a0-c096-5938-9141-93e1080cf185","slug":"advantages-disadvantages","fullItemName":"Advantages and disadvantages","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 2ea8e267-c51e-4600-a7fb-03daa8167a59 --><h4>Advantages and disadvantages of the different treatment options</h4><!-- end field 2ea8e267-c51e-4600-a7fb-03daa8167a59 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item fe383970-5556-40ec-882f-aeee039f6b48 --><!-- begin field cbce50e6-6d22-4587-9e87-fc6a946f2a69 --><h5>Physical insecticides</h5><ul><li><strong>Dimeticone 4% (Hedrin<sup>®</sup> Lotion, licensed medicinal product)</strong><ul><li><strong>Advantages</strong><ul><li>Dimeticone has a well-established safety profile and is usually well tolerated [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/head-lice/references/\">ABPI Medicines Compendium, 2014</a>].</li><li>It can be used in pregnant and breastfeeding women and in children aged 6 months and older [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/head-lice/references/\">ABPI Medicines Compendium, 2014</a>].</li><li>The manufacturer states that Hedrin<sup>®</sup> products are suitable for people with asthma. </li><li>Cure rates of 70% have been reported in clinical trials in the UK [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/head-lice/references/\">Burgess et al, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/head-lice/references/\">Burgess et al, 2007</a>].</li><li>It kills louse by creating a physical barrier around it, so resistance is unlikely to develop.</li><li>It is odourless.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Disadvantages</strong><ul><li>It has poor ovicidal activity (ability to kill the eggs as well as the live lice).</li><li>Minor adverse effects (including skin irritation) have been reported with dimeticone.

However, products with a short contact time which are applied to dry hair, such as isopropyl myristate (Full Marks<sup>®</sup> Solution) and some dimeticone preparations, can be considered because their physical mode of action may mean that a longer contact time is unlikely to be needed, provided the product is applied correctly.</li></ul><h5>Treatment advice</h5><ul><li>Regarding insecticide treatments:<ul><li>Although not recommended by all the manufacturers, advice in the PHMEG guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/head-lice/references/\">PHMEG, 2012</a>] UKMi guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/head-lice/references/\">UKMI Cymru Wales, 2014</a>], and the BNF [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/head-lice/references/\">BNF 72, 2016</a>] is that generally, two applications will be needed, 7 days apart, to kill the lice that have hatched after the first application.</li><li>However, advice from Community Hygeine Concern (<a href=\"http://www.chc.org/homedir/parent_info.cfm\" data-hyperlink-id=\"5093204d-badb-43e7-9af9-a98d0035085b\">www.chc.org</a>) is that this double dose treatment may not be sufficient to treat the infestation. This is because although louse eggs usually hatch 7 to 10 days after being laid, there is some evidence that louse eggs sometimes hatch as early as 5 days or as late as 11 days after being laid. Based on this, the possible risks of the double dose treatment are that: <ul><li>New full-grown lice, caught from other infested heads between applications, will lay more eggs.</li><li>Lice may continue to hatch till day 11, even after a second application on day 7/8.  </li><li>Lice hatch from eggs directly after the first application and reach adulthood before the second application, so they can spread and lay eggs.</li></ul></li><li>An ex-vivo study assessed the effectiveness of 21 French over-the-counter head lice products, some of which have similar formulations to those available in the UK [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/head-lice/references/\">Combescot-Lang, 2015</a>].
