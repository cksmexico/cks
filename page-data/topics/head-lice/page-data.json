Head lice infestation is known as pediculosis capitis.<ul><li>The severity of infestation varies from a few lice (less than 10) to more than 1000 in severe cases, but a typical infestation might have about 30 lice per head.</li><li>If left untreated, head lice infestation may persist for long periods.</li></ul></li><li>Detection combing is the best way to confirm the presence of lice. This is the systematic combing of wet or dry hair using a fine-toothed (0.2–0.3 mm apart) head lice detection comb.</li><li>A diagnosis of active head lice infestation should only be made if a live head louse is found.<ul><li>An itching scalp is not sufficient to diagnose active infestation.</li><li>The presence of louse eggs alone, whether hatched (nits) or unhatched, is not proof of active infestation.</li></ul></li><li>A person should only be treated if a live head louse is found. All affected household members should also be treated on the same day.</li><li>Depending on the preference of the person and/or their parents/carers, their treatment history, the presence of any contraindications, and cost of treatment, head lice can be treated with one of the following:<ul><li>A physical insecticide, such as dimeticone 4% lotion (Hedrin<sup>®</sup>).</li><li>A traditional insecticide, such as malathion 0.5% aqueous liquid (Derbac-M<sup>®</sup>). </li><li>Wet combing with a fine-toothed head louse comb (such as the Bug Buster<sup>®</sup> comb).</li></ul></li><li>No treatment can guarantee success, but a treatment has the best chance of success if it is performed correctly and if all affected household members are treated on the same day. </li><li>Detection combing should be done after all treatments to confirm the success of the treatment. If treatment is unsuccessful (that is, a live louse is found after treatment):<ul><li>It should be confirmed that the treatment was used correctly.</li><li>Household members, close family, and close friends (both adults and children) should be assessed to identify possible sources of reinfestation.</li><li>The same treatment should be repeated, or a different treatment tried. If malathion was used, the possibility of resistance should be considered.</li></ul></li><li>People should be advised that:<ul><li>Children who are being treated for head lice can still attend school.</li><li>There is no evidence that head lice have a preference for either clean or dirty hair.</li><li>There is no need to treat (wash at high temperature or fumigate) clothing or bedding that has been in contact with lice, as the lifespan of a head louse is very short (1 –2 days) once it is detached from a human head.</li><li>Essential oil-based treatments and herbal treatments are not recommended due to the lack of good-quality evidence on their safety and efficacy.</li><li>It is not possible to prevent head lice infestation. Children of primary school age should be examined regularly at home (using a detection comb) to identify infestation early.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 05b3fd72-3af6-46cb-a6da-e40913607420 --><!-- end item f33c04bf-2403-4cf7-925a-c0c521143158 -->","topic":{"id":"ca628e0c-ce13-5d42-b253-54a69b51d894","topicId":"e347bf30-a684-4ab6-843a-e2d2929ff4ca","topicName":"Head lice","slug":"head-lice","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"c07f1a11-a6fc-5dc9-b489-c79c00eed1b2","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"1c07399f-6032-532b-aab2-6e7a99c32991","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"352c1214-5167-5f31-b6e9-2cf3e28637d9","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"bd894c6f-7151-57ad-ba6b-bc7270808fea","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"a3f89268-7fb7-52ef-a4c5-421d1d3e4419","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"6c7acc5e-bafe-57e2-9ff5-75693571b01f","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"d2aaf293-6ebf-5a60-b90f-9a548a5a36ff","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"8234f1df-9ff1-51f0-ada4-683b91f6f2cc","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"b824d73b-ebfe-5acc-a3d6-000ef3a3e102","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"5b4135ed-764c-5eb2-a4b8-d7ecee5b4535","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"cf25fdab-c543-50d9-83c6-37882f9cfc6c","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
