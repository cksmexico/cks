Information from friends, family members, or other health professionals, if available, can be invaluable. Determine:<ul><li>Why was the substance taken? Was it accidental, deliberate or a therapeutic error? Is there a risk of repetition? People who have self-harmed will need a further psychosocial assessment by another trained specialist (mental health worker, social worker) after the treatment of their physical problems.</li><li>Who was involved? Ascertain the age, weight, and sex of the person, and ask about their past medical history, medication and factors that will affect the excretion or metabolism of the poison, such as renal or hepatic impairment.</li><li>What was taken? Ask about the amount taken, other medicines, and alcohol use. Note that the person's account of what and how much has been taken should be treated with clinical suspicion. This can result in inconsistency between an unreliable history and laboratory blood and urine tests.</li><li>When was it taken? Try and establish the exact timing(s) of ingestion or contact. This is especially important in paracetamol poisoning. Was it a single acute overdose, staggered or chronic? </li><li>What was the route of administration? By mouth, inhalation, or injection?</li></ul></li><li>Ask about any symptoms the person may be experiencing, depending upon the substance(s) involved. See <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/diagnosis/symptoms-signs-of-drugs-that-are-commonly-involved-in-poisoning-or-overdose/\">Symptoms and signs of drugs that are commonly involved in poisoning or overdose</a>. </li><li>Perform an examination, depending on the clinical situation. In addition to the assessment of consciousness, breathing and circulation, this may include:<ul><li>General observations. Alcohol or solvents may be smelt on the breath. Atypical bruising may be a sign of violence. There may be needle track marks from injection of drugs of misuse. Skin blisters may be found in people who are, or have been, unconscious due to poisoning. </li><li>Neurological examination and examination of the pupils and eye movements.</li><li>Checking for signs that are consistent with the poison or drug that has been taken. See <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/diagnosis/symptoms-signs-of-drugs-that-are-commonly-involved-in-poisoning-or-overdose/\">Symptoms and signs of drugs that are commonly involved in poisoning or overdose</a>. </li><li>If the poison is not known, compare the person's symptoms and examination findings to those commonly associated with known poisons, see toxidromes in <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/diagnosis/symptoms-signs-of-drugs-that-are-commonly-involved-in-poisoning-or-overdose/\">Symptoms and signs of drugs that are commonly involved in poisoning or overdose</a>.</li></ul></li><li>If the person has deliberately self-poisoned:<ul><li>Assess the person's risk. This includes physical risks (see above); the risk of psychological harm and the risk of further self-harm or suicide; and any safeguarding concerns.</li><li>Assess the risk of psychological harm and the risk of further self-harm or suicide. Explore the person's feelings and mental state. Key psychological characteristics associated with risk include hopelessness, depression and continuing suicidal intent. </li><li>Assess for any safeguarding concerns in children, young people or vulnerable adults. This concerns those who are dependent for their care on the person presenting with self-harm, and people from these groups who present with an episode of self-harm that may have occurred in response to child maltreatment, domestic violence or exploitation. For further information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/child-maltreatment-recognition-management/\">Child maltreatment</a>. </li><li>Where possible, the person should be seen alone for this assessment, to maintain confidentiality and allow the person to discuss any problems between themselves and friends or family. </li><li>Communicate the outcome of these assessments to other healthcare professionals who are involved in the person's care. </li><li>For more information about initial risk assessment, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/self-harm/\">Self-harm</a>.</li></ul></li><li>Investigations are not routinely necessary or appropriate in primary care for those people who do not need emergency referral to hospital.</li><li>Consult the poisons information database, TOXBASE, for information on the specific poison(s) involved, and manage accordingly.

The recommendations regarding the emergency assessment of someone who has been poisoned or taken an overdose are extrapolated from a review article on the hospital assessment and diagnosis of poisoning [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">Vale, 2016b</a>] and the BNF [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">BNF 73, 2017</a>]. The recommendation regarding clinical situations which require emergency transfer to hospital are based on what CKS considers best practice and are extrapolated from the BNF [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">BNF 73, 2017</a>]. The BNF recommends both hypothermia and hyperthermia require urgent transfer to hospital. For amphetamine overdose, a person whose temperature is >38ºC requires urgent active cooling measures [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2015</a>]. A temperature over 39.5ºC is a sign of potentially life-threatening amphetamine toxicity. Opioid overdose should be considered in any person who presents with altered mental state and bradypnoea and miosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">BMJ, 2016c</a>].  </li></ul><h5>Assessment of a person who has been poisoned or taken an overdose</h5><ul><li>The recommendations regarding what to include in the history are based on expert opinion in a review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">Anderson, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">Vale, 2016b</a>], from the TOXBASE website, <a href=\"https://www.toxbase.org/General-Info/Help/Information-likely-to-be-requested-from-enquirers/\" data-hyperlink-id=\"75480ad5-ef1f-4ef7-bd78-a98f018af74a\">www.toxbase.org</a>, and what CKS considers to be best practice. Note that the person's account of what and how much has been taken should be treated with clinical suspicion [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">Vale, 2016b</a>]. This can result in inconsistency between an unreliable history and the results of laboratory blood and urine tests. It is important to try and establish which medicines were actually involved. People often do not use generic pharmaceutical names. As self-poisoning is often impulsive, the person may take tablets from the first container or pack they find, and so the medicine may be another person's prescription. Many people will not know the exact number of tablets they have taken. In this situation, it can be helpful to ask about the number of strips or packets, handfuls or mouthfuls. In paracetamol overdose, a staggered overdose is defined as doses taken over more than one hour [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">BMJ, 2017</a>]. For episodes of poisoning in children, it may be difficult to obtain a clear history from the child or parent of what has happened. It is difficult to quantify the amount taken, as the number of tablets in the container before the episode may not be known. In cases where it is uncertain which poison has been taken, it is very important to ask the family about possible toxic substances that may be in the home [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">Anderson, 2013</a>]. </li><li>The recommendations regarding what to include in the examination are based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">Vale, 2016b</a>] and the [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">BNF 73, 2017</a>]. In cases where the person is unaware of the substances taken or is unable or unwilling to give this information, the poisons involved can sometimes be inferred by comparing the person's symptoms and examination findings to features commonly associated with known poisons (toxidromes) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">NPIS, 2012</a>]. However, this is a guide. The symptoms and signs listed can be caused by other poisons. A person may not show all the features listed for one poison and may have unlisted symptoms or signs. </li></ul><h5>Initial risk assessment</h5><p>The recommendations about performing an initial risk assessment for any person who has self-harmed are based on expert opinion in the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline, <em>The short-term physical and psychological management and secondary prevention of self-harm in primary and secondary care</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2004</a>]. For further information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/self-harm/\">Self-harm</a>.</p><ul><li>It is recommended that people are assessed alone initially to maintain confidentiality and to allow discussion of issues that may relate to the relationship between the person and their family, carers, or significant others that may have contributed to their thoughts of self-harm.</li><li>Each time a person presents following an act of self-harm it should be treated as an independent episode, as the factors contributing to self-harm behaviour can be different on each occasion. Failure to assess each episode in its own right may result in appropriate help not being offered at a time when a person is at high risk of suicide.</li><li>People who have self-harmed should be offered treatment for any physical consequences, even if they are unwilling to accept psychosocial assessment for psychiatric treatment.</li><li>The recommendation to assess a person who has self-harmed for safeguarding issues is based on expert opinion in the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline <em>The short-term physical and psychological management and secondary prevention of self-harm in primary and secondary care</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2004</a>], which advises that healthcare professionals should always consider during initial assessment and treatment whether there are safeguarding concerns for vulnerable adults and children that require local safeguarding procedures to be followed. The Royal College of Psychiatrists report on <em>Managing self-harm in young people </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2014a</a>]<em> </em>also states that children who have recently taken an overdose may be living in households where the adults cannot provide for their basic needs; or may have been abused or exploited. This recommends prompt social services assessment. </li></ul><h5>Investigations</h5><ul><li>The recommendation that investigations are not routinely required in primary care is based on what CKS considers to be best practice. People requiring further investigations should be admitted to hospital for further assessment. </li></ul><h5>Sources of Information</h5><ul><li>The recommendations regarding the situations in which a healthcare practitioner should telephone the NPIS for advice are based on information on the TOXBASE website <a href=\"http://www.toxbase.org/\" data-hyperlink-id=\"740590c6-efd7-47a5-9152-a98f018af779\">http://www.toxbase.org</a> and the NPIS annual report [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">NPIS, 2016</a>].

This recommends a cautious approach, as it is difficult to work out the risk after taking a substance, and it is important to have a thorough evaluation of physical effects and mental health risks. Emergency physical assessment and treatment, initial mental health risk assessment and initial assessment of safeguarding should be performed in the emergency department. NICE and the Royal College of Psychiatrists recommend children and young people under the age of 16 should be admitted overnight following this to allow comprehensive mental health assessment to be performed by appropriately trained professionals [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2004</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2014a</a>].

People who have deliberately self-poisoned should be referred urgently to the nearest accident and emergency department, as the person may not know or may purposefully underestimate the nature and quantity of substances taken, which can make an accurate risk assessment in primary care difficult.

It may change over time, for example, with changing levels of consciousness, emotional distress, or due to the effects of alcohol and/or drugs. Capacity may also vary according to the decision that needs to be made. The Mental Capacity Act (2005) states that all people aged 16 years and over are presumed to have capacity. It aims to balance a person's right to make decisions for themselves with their right to be protected from harm.</li><li><strong>The Mental Capacity Act (2005) has five key principles:</strong><ul><li>Presumption of capacity - adults should always be presumed to have the capacity to make a decision unless the healthcare professional can prove otherwise.</li><li>Maximizing decision-making capacity - the person must be given all practical support before it can be decided that they lack capacity. Support may involve extra time for assessment, repeating the assessment if capacity fluctuates, or using an interpreter or sign language.</li><li>The freedom to make seemingly unwise decisions - if the person makes a seemingly unwise decision, this in itself is not proof of incapacity. Proof of incapacity depends on the process by which the decision is made, not the decision itself.</li><li>Best interests - any decision or action taken on behalf of the person must be in their best interests. If the decision can be delayed until the person regains capacity, then it should be. A decision taken on another's behalf should take account of their wishes, including those expressed in an advance decision, and their beliefs and values. The decision-making process should involve, when appropriate, family, carers, and significant others.</li><li>The least restrictive alternative - when a decision is made on the person's behalf, the healthcare professional must choose the alternative that interferes least with the person's rights and freedoms while still achieving the necessary goal.</li></ul></li><li>Capacity may be impaired by a number of factors, such as mental health disorders, alcohol or drug intoxication, drug withdrawal, confusion, significant emotional distress or anger, or due to intellectual disability. </li><li><strong>To assess capacity, confirm that the person has an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain</strong>, which means they are unable to:<ul><li>Understand relevant information about the decision to be made. </li><li>Or, retain that information.</li><li>Or, use or weigh that information as part of the decision-making process.</li><li>Or, communicate their decision (by talking, non-verbal communication, or any other means).</li></ul></li><li><strong>If a person fails one or more parts of this test and has an impairment of, or disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain, they do not have the relevant capacity. </strong></li><li>When assessing a person's capacity, it may be useful to consider three questions:<ul><li>Does the person have an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, their mind or brain?</li><li>Is the person unable to make a specific decision at the time it needs to be made for one or more of the reasons given in the Act?</li><li>Is the person’s inability to make the specific decision at the time it needs to be made because of the impairment of, or disturbance in the functioning of, their mind or brain?</li></ul></li><li><strong>People who have capacity are entitled to make decisions that clinicians may think unwise</strong>. This right is protected by law in the Mental Capacity Act </li><li><strong>The Mental Capacity Act also covers emergency situations.</strong> When someone who lacks capacity needs emergency medical treatment to save their life or prevent them coming to harm, the steps that are reasonable when assessing capacity and best interests will be different to the steps in non-urgent cases. In emergencies, it will almost always be in the person's best interest to give urgent treatment without delay. It is necessary to show that capacity has been considered, even if this has only been done so briefly. </li><li><strong>In emergency situations involving children or young people aged under 16, or when the intervention is for the protection of others</strong>, common law, or the 'doctrine of necessity', applies. The principles of common law state:<ul><li>The healthcare professional must reasonably believe that action is necessary to prevent harm to the person, or others.</li><li>Actions must be proportionate to the likelihood of the person, or others, being harmed and the seriousness of this harm. </li></ul></li><li>Healthcare professionals should understand:<ul><li>The Mental Capacity Act (2005) applies in England and Wales.</li><li>The Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act (2000) applies in Scotland. For more information, see the British Medical Association's document Medical treatments for adults with incapacity: guidance on ethical and medico-legal issues in Scotland [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">BMA, 2009a</a>].</li><li>In Northern Ireland, common law applies.</li><li>When and how <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/management/management/#the-mental-health-act\">The Mental Health Act (1983)</a> can be used in the urgent assessment of people who have self-harmed to treat the physical consequences of self-harm if their behaviour has been caused by a mental health condition.</li><li>That they have a duty to protect confidentiality wherever possible, but medical information may be disclosed without consent if a person lacks capacity and it is in their best interests.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Capacity and confidentiality issues in young people aged 16–17 years</h5><ul><li>For young people aged 16–17 years who lack capacity, parents can consent on their behalf if the decision to be made is felt to be within parental control. Healthcare professionals are, however, able to give treatment regardless of whether parental consent has been given, as long as the principles of the Mental Capacity Act (2005) are followed, and the decision is judged to be in the young person's best interests.</li><li>If a young person who self-harms and has capacity refuses to involve their family or carers in their treatment, or refuses consent to disclose issues relating to their safety to family or carers, healthcare professionals must weigh the young person's right to confidentiality (and risk to the therapeutic relationship if confidentiality is breached) against providing family and carers with sufficient information to protect and care for the young person.
