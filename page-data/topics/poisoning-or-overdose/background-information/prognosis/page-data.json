Many children can be managed at home, while others may need to be observed for a short time in hospital [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">Anderson, 2013</a>].</li><li>However, severe poisoning does occur. High-risk medications, where ingestion of one or two adult doses could be fatal for a 10 kg toddler, include tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotics, quinine, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, antimalarials, theophylline, opioids and oral hypoglycemics [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">Anderson, 2013</a>].</li><li>28 children aged 4 years and under died from unintentional pharmaceutical poisoning between 2001 and 2013.

Of all the drug-related deaths registered in 2013:<ul><li>66% of male and 55% of female deaths were due to accidental poisoning [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">ONS, 2013</a>].
