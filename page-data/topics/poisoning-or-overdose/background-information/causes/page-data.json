Antidepressants, hypnotics and analgesics are the groups of medicines that are most commonly taken. </li><li>In 2015/16, around 70% of the reasons for accessing TOXBASE  were for information related to pharmaceuticals, and approximately 15% were for household chemicals [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">NPIS, 2016</a>]. TOXBASE is a clinically-based toxicology database that is regularly updated and authenticated by the National Poisons Information Service, NPIS. See <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/management/management/#information-sources\">Information sources</a> for further information.</li><li>The pharmaceutical most commonly enquired about in telephone contacts with the NPIS, and in online TOXBASE accesses, was paracetamol. This was followed by ibuprofen, and then co-codamol and codeine phosphate [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">NPIS, 2016</a>]. Other medicines commonly asked about, or accessed on TOXBASE, included: sertraline, diazepam, citalopram, mirtazapine, zopiclone, tramadol and quetiapine. </li><li>In its Information Service Report, the NPIS highlighted the following important causes of poisoning [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">NPIS, 2016</a>]:<ul><li>Drugs of misuse. The number of telephone enquiries and online accesses regarding new drugs of misuse, now called new psychoactive substances (NPS), has increased. There is a lack of information about their pharmacology and toxicology, and it can be difficult to know which chemicals have actually been ingested as these have many brand names. NPS include synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and so-called 'legal highs'. </li><li>2,4-dinithrophenol. This is an industrial chemical. It is not a licensed medicine and is sometimes dangerously used for weight loss. There have been 11 deaths associated with this since 2008.</li><li>Electronic nicotine delivery systems. Many electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and their liquid refills contain nicotine, which is highly toxic. The majority of the reported exposures were accidental, with 37 percent involving children under five. Ingestion was the most frequent route of exposure, although there were cases where there was ingestion or inhalation of the liquid while trying to inhale the e-cigarette vapour. Three adults suffered cardiac arrest following poisoning with nicotine from e-cigarettes in 2015/16, one of whom died. </li><li>Iron. Poisoning with iron is one of the most potentially serious forms of poisoning in the UK. The NPIS conducted a 2-year prospective study in order to gain information about treatment with the antidote, desferrioxamine. This showed that there were 1210 telephone advice calls regarding iron poisonings. Few of these cases were severe, and proportionately few people required the antidote (compared to paracetamol poisoning, for example). There were, however, four deaths. These were thought to be related to other pre-existing conditions, or to other drugs that were also taken in overdose. </li><li>Pesticides. Most cases are not associated with toxicity. In 2015/16 there were 3 episodes of exposure associated with severe toxicity and one death after the ingestion of paraquat.</li><li>Household chemicals. The NPIS gathers information on exposures to products such as dishwasher tablets, oven cleaners and vehicle screen washes in order to gain an understanding of their harmful effects.</li><li>Carbon monoxide poisoning. There were 2463 hospital admissions between 2001 and 2010 in England due to accidental poisoning from this, and 2171 due to deliberate poisoning [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">Ghosh, 2015</a>].
