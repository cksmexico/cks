People who are suspected of taking a paracetamol overdose should be urgently admitted to hospital. </strong></p><p>Nausea and vomiting usually settle within 24 hours. If these continue, often with the development of right subcostal pain, this suggests the development of hepatic necrosis which may lead to encephalopathy, hypoglycaemia, haemorrhage, cerebral oedema and death.</p><p>People may also present with coma or a reduced level of consciousness if they have taken paracetamol with a drug that reduces the level of consciousness, such as opioids (for example a combined paracetamol/opioid preparation) or alcohol.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Aspirin</td><td>Hyperventilation, tinnitus, deafness, vasodilatation, and sweating. Coma if very severe poisoning.</td></tr><tr><td>Tricyclic and related antidepressants</td><td>Dry mouth, seizures, coma, cardiac conduction defects and arrhythmias, hypothermia, hypotension, hyperreflexia and respiratory failure. There may be dilated pupils and urinary retention. </td></tr><tr><td>Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</td><td>Nausea, vomiting, agitation, tremor, nystagmus, drowsiness, sinus tachycardia. There may be convulsions. Rarely, severe poisonings may result in serotonin syndrome with marked neuropsychiatric effects, autonomic instability and neuromuscular hyperactivity. There may be hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, and coagulation deficiencies.</td></tr><tr><td>Beta-blockers</td><td>In therapeutic overdose there may be lightheadedness or syncope due to bradycardia and hypotension. Heart failure can be exacerbated or precipitated. The effects of a large overdose depend on which beta-blocker is involved. Sotalol can cause ventricular tachycardia. There can be coma and convulsions with propranolol overdose. </td></tr><tr><td>Calcium-channel blockers</td><td>Nausea, vomiting, agitation, confusion, dizziness and coma. Hyperglycaemia may occur. Dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers cause profound peripheral vasodilatation and severe hypotension. Verapamil and diltiazem can cause arrhythmias including complete heart block and asystole.</td></tr><tr><td>Iron salts</td><td>Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, haematemesis, and rectal bleeding. Hypotension and hepatocellular necrosis can occur later. If severe poisoning: coma and shock.</td></tr><tr><td>Lithium</td><td>Most cases of toxicity occur in people who are on long-term treatment with lithium, and whose excretion of lithium is reduced for example due to dehydration or infection. There is a delayed onset of symptoms in deliberate overdose (12 hours or more). Initially, apathy and restlessness followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, ataxia, tremor, weakness, dysarthria, and muscle twitching. If severe poisoning: electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, convulsions, renal failure, hypotension and coma.</td></tr><tr><td>Theophylline</td><td>Onset of toxicity can be delayed if a modified-release preparation is involved. Severe vomiting, restlessness, agitation, dilated pupils, hyperglycaemia and tachycardia. More serious effects include haematemesis, seizures and arrhythmias (supraventricular and ventricular). Hypokalaemia can develop quickly. </td></tr><tr><td>Benzodiazepines</td><td>Drowsiness, dysarthria, ataxia, and nystagmus. Respiratory depression and coma can also occur.</td></tr><tr><td>Antimalarials- quinine, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine</td><td><p>Rapid onset of life-threatening arrhythmias and intractable convulsions.</p><p>Note overdose with these is extremely dangerous and difficult to treat. The person should be referred to hospital urgently. </p></td></tr><tr><td>Phenothiazines and related drugs</td><td>Sinus tachycardia, arrhythmias, hypothermia, hypotension, reduced consciousness and respiratory depression. Dystonic reactions may be seen with therapeutic doses. Seizures in severe cases. </td></tr><tr><td>Second-generation antipsychotic drugs</td><td>Drowsiness, hypotension, extrapyramidal symptoms, convulsions, ECG abnormalities such as QT prolongation. </td></tr><tr><td>Amphetamines</td><td>Initially excessive activity, wakefulness, hallucinations, paranoia and hypertension. Later there may be convulsions, hyperthermia, exhaustion and coma.</td></tr><tr><td>Cocaine</td><td>Agitation, hypertension, tachycardia, dilated pupils, hallucinations, hyperthermia, hypertonia and hyperreflexia and cardiac effects such as chest pain, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction.</td></tr><tr><td>Opioids</td><td>Drowsiness, coma, respiratory depression, pinpoint pupils. </td></tr><tr><td>Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (Ecstasy)</td><td>Delirium, coma, hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, acute hepatitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, adult respiratory distress syndrome, hyperreflexia, hypotension and intracerebral haemorrhage; hyponatraemia, convulsions, ventricular arrhythmias, delirium, coma.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Data from: </strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">BNF 73, 2017</a>]</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Table 2.</strong> Toxidromes. </p><table><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Type of poisoning</th><th scope=\"col\">Common agents</th><th scope=\"col\">Toxic signs and symptoms</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Anticholingergic</td><td>Antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants, carbamazepine, phenothiazines.</td><td>Tachycardia, hyperthermia, dilated pupils, warm and dry skin, urinary retention, agitation.</td></tr><tr><td>Cholinergic</td><td>Carbamates, organophosphates insecticines, some mushrooms.</td><td>Salivation, lacrimation, urination, diarrhoea, bronchorrhoea, bronchospasm, bradycardia, vomiting.</td></tr><tr><td>Hallucinogenic</td><td>Amphetamines, cocaine, MDMA.</td><td>Hallucinations, panic, seizures, hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnoea.</td></tr><tr><td>Opioid</td><td>Morphine, codeine, methadone</td><td>Hypoventilation, hypotension, miosis, sedation, bradycardia. </td></tr><tr><td>Sedative/hypnotic</td><td>Anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, ethanol</td><td>Ataxia, blurred vision, sedation, hallucinations, slurred speech, nystagmus.</td></tr><tr><td>Sympathomimetic</td><td>Amphetamines, cocaine, MDMA.</td><td>Tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis, agitation, seizures, hyperthermia, sweating.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Data from:</strong> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/poisoning-or-overdose/references/\">Anderson, 2013</a>]</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- end field 834d161d-2c5d-4d21-ab0d-a76f00999a8d --><!-- end item 8a1dd322-6841-4da7-b248-a76f00999921 -->","topic":{"id":"35a9353c-780d-5888-b05d-86650e852d6e","topicId":"94eca2fa-634d-4fe4-97af-372492295e17","topicName":"Poisoning or overdose","slug":"poisoning-or-overdose","lastRevised":"Last revised in June 2017","chapters":[{"id":"fd8c261c-01ed-5610-bde0-8d80500e7c37","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"ab031f66-f43b-5ca2-a974-4d57cd3f46d6","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"ffafe309-e0db-5e65-a7a3-fad084107042","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"d72b8e4f-20c4-5cdc-b158-f3a116f8f63b","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"3af95292-5377-556e-b656-f4445a8f07a5","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"45919048-a26c-5310-a5eb-a3c00dc9101e","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"dcd0644d-5f1b-504a-b607-534ef46d1c2f","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"d089557e-7ca4-53c5-891f-17dd4b82988b","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"93b82eea-382d-50bc-9584-6095ff36e295","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"15f66839-61db-56fc-abce-3c6b229f76b2","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"b21d2dfd-e8ec-51f2-9341-0a47dd3ff141","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
