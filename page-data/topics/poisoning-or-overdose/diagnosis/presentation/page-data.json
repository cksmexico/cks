Poisoned children and adolescents may present with altered behaviour or reduced consciousness, for which there is no obvious cause.</li><li>Consider poisoning as a cause of altered level of consciousness in adults. Circumstantial evidence, such as tablets or empty medicine containers nearby or a suicide note (with no signs of physical violence), may provide a clue to the diagnosis. </li><li>Other clinical situations where poisoning is a possibility include:<ul><li>Acute confusional states, for example from the use of illegal drugs. </li><li>Hypoglycaemia, for example from sulphonylurea or meglitinide overdose. </li><li>Abnormal liver function tests. Paracetamol overdose needs to be excluded if there are raised transaminases along with prolonged prothrombin time.</li><li>Unexplained seizures, for example due to drug toxicity.</li><li>Abnormal bleeding, for example due to warfarin and new anticoagulants.</li><li>Several people presenting with similar symptoms. Symptoms such as headache and confusion affecting members of the same household can be due to carbon monoxide poisoning. For further information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/carbon-monoxide-poisoning/\">Carbon monoxide poisoning</a>.</li><li>Recurrent or chronic unexplained symptoms in children. Deliberate poisoning (as a form of Munchausen syndrome by proxy or fictitious disorder) is rare, but important to identify promptly.
