NICE suggests this may be due to the fact that eradication therapy can prevent the recurrence of peptic ulcer disease and prevent the formation of peptic ulcers in people who are at risk of developing them, which reduces the need for maintenance acid suppression therapy.</li></ul></li><li>PHE recommends offering a one month course of PPI therapy first, before testing for <em>H. pylori</em>, for most people in the UK [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-unidentified-cause/references/\">PHE, 2016</a>].<ul><li>It notes that the prevalence of <em>H. pylori</em> is less than 15% in many areas of the UK, so a trial of PPI is a sensible first-line approach for most people.

It may provide short-term symptom relief, but does not prevent dyspepsia symptoms.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h5>Arranging specialist referral</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on arranging referral for endoscopy or to a gastroenterologist for a specialist opinion are largely based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-unidentified-cause/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>] and the PHE publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-unidentified-cause/references/\">PHE, 2016</a>].<ul><li>NICE states that the widespread use of endoscopy would not be cost-effective, as the majority of endoscopic findings will not change clinical management, and there is a small risk of harm from the procedure, such as discomfort, gastrointestinal perforation or bleeding.</li><li>NICE cites five trials comparing early endoscopy with empirical acid suppression therapy, which found no differences in global improvement or symptom scores after one year of follow-up. Study limitations included the fact that different types of dyspepsia were combined in a single measure, and two trials were based on secondary care. It concludes that although early endoscopy may reduce patient and medical uncertainty about the underlying diagnosis, it does not provide better patient outcomes, and it is unlikely that it would reduce the cost of managing dyspepsia over one year.</li><li>Similarly, NICE reviewed evidence comparing an <em>H. pylori</em> test-and-treat strategy with endoscopy, which found no significant difference in symptom burden between the two approaches. NICE comments that the study findings were heterogeneous and the two strategies cannot be considered equivalent, however the test-and-treat strategy has led to a two-thirds reduction in the number of endoscopies performed.</li><li>The recommendation on stopping acid suppression therapy at least two weeks before endoscopy is based on the fact that drug treatment may mask or delay the detection of gastric and oesophageal cancer.</li><li>PHE recommend that third-line <em>H. pylori</em> eradication should only be offered on the advice of a specialist, and advises referral if there are limited antibiotic options to use for <em>H pylori</em> eradication therapy.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 40a64772-eccb-4232-87cf-a76e01365f7d --><!-- end item b03b93d9-6ce1-4d2a-bcc1-a76e01365f7d -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
