Additionally, a Cochrane systematic review found no good evidence that cough medicines available over-the-counter are effective [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">Smith et al, 2014</a>]. </li></ul><h5>When to prescribe antibiotics</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline <em>Pneumonia (community-acquired): antimicrobial prescribing. </em>This<em> </em>advises starting antibiotic treatment in people with community-acquired pneumonia as soon as possible after establishing a diagnosis (within 4 hours, or within 1 hour if the person has high-risk criteria for sepsis) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019a</a>]. This is consistent with an expert consensus guideline and panel report which recommends using empirical antibiotics (in line with local and national guidelines) if pneumonia is suspected in settings where imaging cannot be obtained [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">Hill et al, 2019</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Antibiotic choice</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on which antibiotics to prescribe and the doses and duration of treatment are based on expert opinion in the NICE guideline <em>Pneumonia (community-acquired): antimicrobial prescribing</em><em> </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019a</a>]. <ul><li>Evidence is limited, but showed no major difference in clinical effectiveness between antibiotics or classes of antibiotics. The choice of antibiotic is therefore largely based on the experience of the NICE guideline committee, taking into account the activity of individual antibiotics against likely pathogens, their potential for harm, and the risk of antimicrobial resistance [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019a</a>]. </li><li>In the low-severity adult group, amoxicilin is considered the first choice because of its good activity against <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, and low adverse effects and resistance rates. Doxycycline, clarithromycin, and erythromycin act well against <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, but have a broader spectrum of activity and some have additional safety considerations [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019a</a>]. </li><li>For adults with moderate severity community-acquired pneumonia, the choice of antibiotic is based on the expert opinion of the NICE guideline committee. The addition of a macrolide to amoxicillin if an atypical pathogen is suspected gives a broader spectrum of activity with which to target atypical pathogens. If a person is unable to take a penicillin, the committee found no reasonable alternatives for dual therapy, but were of the opinion that doxycycline or clarithromycin alone have good activity against <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and atypical infections [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019a</a>]. </li><li>For young people with community-acquired pneumonia, there was limited evidence, therefore the choice of antibiotics was largely based on the expert opinion of the committee on antibiotic activity against likely pathogens, adverse effects, and reducing the risk of antimicrobial resistance. Amoxicillin was first choice in young people with non-severe community-acquired pneumonia, due to its effectiveness against common pathogens and its tolerability and wide experience in current practice. Clarithromycin, erythromycin, and doxycycline have good activity against <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, but have a broader spectrum of activity so are not considered unless amoxicillin cannot be used [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019a</a>]. </li></ul></li></ul><h5>When to seek medical advice</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the NICE guideline <em>Pneumonia (community-acquired): antimicrobial prescribing</em>, in which it was noted that community-acquired pneumonia has the potential to be life-threatening and that rapid changes in a person's condition can occur [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019a</a>]. It is also consistent with the recommendation in the NICE guideline <em>Pneumonia in adults: diagnosis and management </em>to advise people with community-acquired pneumonia to consult their healthcare professional if their condition is deteriorating or not improving as expected [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Advising on the natural history of pneumonia</h5><ul><li>The NICE guideline <em>Pneumonia (community-acquired): antimicrobial prescribing </em>suggests giving advice on how long symptoms are likely to last<em>  </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019a</a>].<strong> </strong>The advice on expected recovery time for a person with community-acquired pneumonia is based on expert opinion in the NICE guideline <em>Pneumonia in adults: diagnosis and management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>].</li></ul><h5>Written information</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is pragmatic and is based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><h5>Smoking cessation </h5><ul><li>The BTS recommends that people with suspected community-acquired pneumonia should be advised not to smoke as part of a self-care general management strategy, and smoking cessation advice should be offered to people with community-acquired pneumonia who are current smokers [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">BTS, 2015a</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field a8d1d064-39ca-4fc1-b027-453aae6bd0ce --><!-- end item ce844fb2-513c-403d-9242-df8c9f0731a5 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"2b8294fa-e281-51d2-a44e-aaabce5a9105","slug":"follow-up","fullItemName":"Follow up","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field a57ea6d5-70a5-4e93-9762-aae1f1f79e30 --><h3>How should I follow up a person with community-acquired pneumonia in primary care?</h3><!-- end field a57ea6d5-70a5-4e93-9762-aae1f1f79e30 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 23cc8dfc-b995-455a-a731-78623bd0f626 --><!-- begin field 3ad27cd1-d85d-47dc-8601-44db3a5c4c23 --><ul><li><strong>Reassess people with community-acquired pneumonia if symptoms and signs do not improve as expected or worsen rapidly or significantly.</strong><ul><li>Be aware of non-bacterial causes of community-acquired pneumonia such as flu.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Assess symptoms and signs and disease severity and review the need for hospital admission or seeking specialist advice.</strong> <ul><li>For more information on the CRB-65 score and other factors influencing the decision to admit a person with community-acquired pneumonia to hospital, see the sections on <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/diagnosis/assessment/\">Assessment</a> and <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/management/community-acquired-pneumonia/#referral-seeking-specialist-advice\">Referral and specialist advice</a>.  </li></ul></li><li><strong>If a sample has already been sent for microbiological testing,</strong> when the results are available review the choice of antibiotic and consider changing the antibiotic(s) according to the results (using a narrower spectrum antibiotic if appropriate).</li><li><strong>Arrange a chest X-ray after 6 weeks</strong> for adults:<ul><li>With symptoms and signs that persist despite treatment. </li><li>Who are at higher risk of underlying malignancy (particularly smokers and people aged more than 50 years).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Advise people who smoke to stop.</strong> For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/smoking-cessation/\">Smoking cessation</a>. </li><li><div><strong>Consider whether pneumococcal or influenza immunization is necessary</strong> after the person has recovered from the acute illness.
