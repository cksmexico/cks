Experts agree that symptomatic treatments are the mainstay of treatment for acute bronchitis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">Kinkade and Long, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">MQIC, 2018</a>].<ul><li>The recommendation that adequate fluid intake should be maintained is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good medical practice and is in line with a North American guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">MQIC, 2018</a>].  </li><li>NICE reviewed the evidence for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for people with a common cold and found no significant difference compared with placebo for cumulative cough score. On the basis of this, the committee agreed that there was no benefit of NSAIDs on cough symptoms, but that paracetamol or ibuprofen are commonly used to manage associated pain [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019b</a>]. </li></ul></li></ul><h5>Self-care treatments</h5><ul><li>NICE notes that some people may wish to try self-care treatments such as honey, pelargonium, and over-the-counter cough medicines containing guaifenesin and cough suppressants (except codeine), for which there is limited evidence of benefit for the relief of cough symptoms. Antihistamines, decongestants, and codeine-containing cough suppressants are not mentioned as there is limited evidence indicating that they do not help cough symptoms,<strong> </strong>and they have the potential for adverse effects such as drowsiness and dry mouth [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019b</a>].</li></ul><h5>Smoking cessation </h5><ul><li>The recommendation to advise smoking cessation is supported by an evidence summary which describes an episode of acute bronchitis as an opportunity to discuss smoking cessation (despite a lack of evidence associating cigarette use and acute bronchitis) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2018</a>], and a North American guideline on managing acute uncomplicated bronchitis in adults, which advises avoiding smoke and second-hand smoke [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">MQIC, 2018</a>]. </li></ul><h5>When to advise seeking medical help </h5><ul><li><p>This recommendation is based on advice for people with acute cough in the NICE guideline <em>Cough (acute): antimicrobial prescribing, </em>which also states that acute cough usually lasts up to 3 or 4 weeks, and can have infective and non-infective causes other than viral upper respiratory tract infection and acute bronchitis<em> </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019b</a>]. </p></li></ul><h5>Antibiotic prescribing </h5><h5>Antibiotics not needed in people who are otherwise well and not at higher risk of complications</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the evidence and the expert opinion of the NICE guideline committee for <em>Cough (acute): antimicrobial prescribing </em>which states that acute cough associated with acute bronchitis is usually a self-limiting infection and antibiotics are usually not required, although it was acknowledged that antibiotics may be an option on an individual basis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019b</a>]. It is also consistent with an expert consensus guideline and panel report which states that for outpatient adults with acute cough and no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, antibiotics are not routinely required [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">Hill et al, 2019</a>].  <br>The recommendation on information to give the person is in line with the NICE recommendation to offer advice about why an antibiotic is not needed when the person does not receive a prescription [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019b</a>], and a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">Kinkade and Long, 2016</a>].<ul><li>Most cases of acute bronchitis are viral. Antibiotics have limited effectiveness treating people with acute bronchitis and there are concerns about the impact of unnecessary antibiotics on healthcare costs and antimicrobial resistance, as well as the potental for adverse effects [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">Kinkade and Long, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">Smith et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2018</a>]. </li></ul></li></ul><h5>Immediate antibiotic prescription if the person is systemically very unwell</h5><ul><li>The NICE committee for the guideline <em>Cough (acute): antimicrobial prescribing </em>were of the opinion, based on evidence and clinical experience, that people with an acute cough associated with bronchitis who are systemically very unwell on face-to face examination should be offered an immediate antibiotic prescription because they need prompt treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019b</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Immediate or back-up antibiotic prescription if the person is at higher risk of complications</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the NICE guideline <em>Cough (acute): antimicrobial prescribing,</em> in which the committee acknowledged the increased likelihood of people with acute cough developing complications if they have a pre-existing comorbidity, or are of older age and fulfil certain criteria. Taking into account the evidence and their clinical experience, it was agreed that an immediate or back-up antibiotic prescription could be considered [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019b</a>].  </li><li>The discussion points for when a back-up prescription is given are based on the NICE guideline <em>Cough (acute): antimicrobial prescribing. </em>The committee discussed the importance of safety-netting advice to ensure medical help is sought appropriately [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019b</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Antibiotic prescribing based on C-reactive protein (CRP) test results</h5><ul><li>The recommendation on using CRP test results to guide antibiotic prescribing for people presenting with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection in primary care is based on expert opinion in the NICE guideline <em>Diagnosis and management of community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia in adults</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>] and is consistent with recommendations in the NICE guideline <em>Cough (acute): antimicrobial prescribing </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019b</a>].</li></ul><h5>Antibiotic choice</h5><ul><li>These recommendations are based on the NICE guideline <em>Cough (acute): antimicrobial prescribing </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019b</a>]. <ul><li>Taking into account evidence, expert opinion, and resistance data, doxycycline was recommended as first choice for adults with acute cough and bronchitis (excluding pregnant women), if antibiotic treatment is appropriate. The committee were in agreement that amoxicillin should be reserved for more serious infections with a higher likelihood of bacterial infection (such as pneumonia) to avoid driving resistance. The evidence suggesting an increased benefit of doxycycline compared with amoxicillin, clarithromycin or erythromycin is limited, therefore they are offered as alternative first choices [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019b</a>].</li><li>Amoxicillin was recommended as the first choice in young people aged 12–17 years; clarithromycin, erythromycin, or doxycycline were considered to be alternative choices by the NICE committee. </li></ul></li></ul><h5>Duration of antibiotic treatment</h5><ul><li>The NICE committee for the guideline <em>Cough (acute): antimicrobial prescribing</em> found no evidence comparing different length course of antibiotics, but were of the opinion that the shortest effective course should be used. They concluded that, if antibiotic treatment is appropriate, a 5-day course is adequate to treat acute cough, while minimising the risk of resistance [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019b</a>].  </li></ul><h5>Discussion of antibiotic adverse effects</h5><ul><li>This recommendation reflects advice in the NICE guideline <em>Cough (acute): antimicrobial prescribing </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019b</a>].</li></ul><h5>Oral or inhaled bronchodilator, oral or inhaled corticosteroid, or mucolytic treatment.</h5><ul><li>The recommendations to only offer oral or inhaled bronchodilator or corticosteroid treatment to people with acute cough associated with acute bronchitis with an underlying airway disease such as asthma, and not to offer mucolytic treatment, are based on<strong> </strong>the NICE guideline <em>Cough (acute): antimicrobial prescribing </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019b</a>]. <ul><li>Evidence suggests that bronchodilators such as oral or inhaled salbutamol are not of benefit for cough symptoms and increase the likelihood of adverse effects, but it was recognised by the NICE committee that some people with an acute cough and underlying airways disease (for example asthma) may require bronchodilator treatment.</li><li>Evidence for inhaled corticosteroids for cough symptoms was conflicting, and no evidence was found for oral corticosteroids. Taking into account the potential adverse effects, the NICE committee did not recommend their use for acute cough in acute bronchitis, unless a person had underlying airways disease (for example asthma).  </li><li>Evidence for mucolytics for cough symptoms was also mixed, with unclear clinical significance of benefit. </li></ul></li></ul><h5>Written information</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is pragmatic and is based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><!-- end field 0b7c1320-307f-4d74-beb0-297cf76b19ab --><!-- end item 8a67984b-0612-4337-a2fe-4525ccb0b96e -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"4947e6b0-d22d-580e-84f2-97e1e128ccec","slug":"follow-up","fullItemName":"Follow up","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 635c8a25-6cd4-41f6-8d2b-3500e5dd65ca --><h3>How should I follow up a person with acute bronchitis?</h3><!-- end field 635c8a25-6cd4-41f6-8d2b-3500e5dd65ca -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 8a681a77-e019-489e-a06c-58d949f819e4 --><!-- begin field 42b9a96c-47e0-412e-bada-3258c8692767 --><ul><li><strong>Routine follow-up is not necessary for a person with suspected acute bronchitis.</strong> </li><li><strong>Reassess a person with an acute cough if their symptoms get rapidly or significantly worse. </strong><ul><li>Consider other diagnoses and rule out serious causes for symptoms (such as pneumonia or sepsis). For more information, see the section on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/cough/background-information/causes/\">Causes</a> in the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/cough/\">Cough</a>. </li><li>Consider previous antibiotic use and the potential for resistant bacteria.</li></ul></li><li><strong>If the person has already received a course of antibiotics,</strong> seek specialist advice on further management.</li></ul><!-- end field 42b9a96c-47e0-412e-bada-3258c8692767 --><!-- end item 8a681a77-e019-489e-a06c-58d949f819e4 -->","subChapters":[{"id":"9b734e10-05c9-58e5-8c57-79550a13ba38","slug":"basis-for-recommendation-939","fullItemName":"Basis for recommendation","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 7329c9e4-cd98-49b9-8282-e2e4fc191a61 --><h4>Basis for recommendation</h4><!-- end field 7329c9e4-cd98-49b9-8282-e2e4fc191a61 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 939eb722-e744-4dcd-924e-14bb03be2cfc --><!-- begin field d7bc000a-0e8e-4c55-af30-cbf3525ea794 --><h5>Routine follow-up</h5><ul><li>CKS has not recommended routine follow up for a person with suspected acute bronchitis in line with an evidence summary which states that long-term monitoring of people with acute bronchitis is rarely necessary, with symptoms usually resolving within a few weeks [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2018</a>]. </li></ul><h5>When to reassess</h5><ul><li>The recommendation on when to reassess people with an acute cough is based on advice in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline <em>Cough (acute): antimicrobial prescribing </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019b</a>].<ul><li>This advises taking account of alternative diagnoses (for example pneumonia) or symptoms and signs indicative of a more serious illness or condition (for example sepsis) if symptoms worsen rapidly or significantly in a person with acute cough [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">NICE, 2019b</a>]. Expert opinion in a review article states that people with suspected acute bronchitis should have more serious causes of cough excluded (for example asthma, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, or pneumonia) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/references/\">Kinkade and Long, 2016</a>]. </li></ul></li></ul><h5>When to seek specialist advice</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to seek specialist advice for a person who has already received a course of antibiotics is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.
