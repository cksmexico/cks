The incidence increases with age, with a peak onset at 30–50 years. RA is 2–4 times more common in women than in men.</li><li>Clinical features of synovitis include pain, swelling, heat and stiffness in affected joints. </li><li>All people suspected of having RA should be referred for specialist assessment to confirm the diagnosis (within 3 weeks of referral). Referral should be within 3 working days of presentation if any of the following are present:<ul><li>Small joints of the hands or feet are affected.</li><li>More than one joint is affected.</li><li>There has been a delay of 3 months or longer between the onset of symptoms and the person seeking medical advice.</li></ul></li><li>Initial management of suspected RA should include considering offering a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible along with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) until a rheumatology appointment is available.</li><li>Management of RA should be managed under specialist care, where a treat to target strategy is used — the aim is to achieve a target of remission or low disease activity if remission cannot be achieved.</li><li>Specialists will usually offer a conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (cDMARD) as monotherapy — for example, oral methotrexate, leflunomide, or sulfasalazine. The dose is increased depending on tolerance.<ul><li>Hydroxychloroquine may be used as an alternative for people with palindromic disease. </li><li>Short-term bridging treatment with glucocorticoids (oral, intramuscular or intra-articular) may be used when starting a new cDMARD to improve symptoms while waiting for the new DMARD to take effect.</li><li>Additional cDMARDs may be offered in combination in a step-up strategy when the treatment target has not been achieved despite dose escalation.</li></ul></li><li>If the disease is severe and has not responded to intensive therapy with a combination of cDMARDs, biological DMARDs may be offered in combination with methotrexate, or alone (depending on the product licence) for people who cannot take methotrexate. </li><li>Management of RA flare in primary care should include:<ul><li>Excluding septic arthritis.</li><li>Seeking specialist advice.</li><li>Offering short-term treatment with glucoccorticoids (intra-articular, intramuscular, or an oral).</li></ul></li><li>Referral to a specialist for a surgical opinion should be offered if any of the following do not respond to optimal non-surgical management:<ul><li>Persistent pain due to joint damage or other identifiable soft tissue cause.</li><li>Worsening joint function.</li><li>Progressive deformity.</li><li>Persistent localized synovitis.</li></ul></li><li>Referral to a specialist for a surgical opinion should also be offered to people with any of the following complications: <ul><li>Imminent or actual tendon rupture.</li><li>Nerve compression.</li><li>A stress fracture.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field d6169899-f78e-4eca-a7b6-adb3e825bdbf --><!-- end item 1adab124-da57-4fc6-acbc-076e8f478cee -->","topic":{"id":"80425c66-11ed-5a54-aecf-455f339cb0cd","topicId":"d9596563-d663-48ca-8d6a-4ddeb263b46e","topicName":"Rheumatoid arthritis","slug":"rheumatoid-arthritis","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"e5b4cb7c-c830-59e0-a369-a8151bd28e7c","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"28d53d37-f5b2-5ab0-bd6f-6c6858fc63e4","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"8eb76d85-83a8-5bb1-be89-15a9e86def8d","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"7eba8b39-2fb0-52b0-8988-5d108c1720fa","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"add57644-4b68-5377-b8ce-b0cc395570f0","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"62d68b4b-4522-5afb-88fe-48b87fc31a2d","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"f9fe7005-bf48-5a4e-bc7c-08550e792a18","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"cc0b2b43-25e2-5936-ad94-217419fd0126","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"6a0fead6-ca32-5399-9b1b-22b31fc0c765","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"f76001a5-99f4-5086-bc05-c1cd7535aab0","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"fb29501f-d465-5652-b659-ffb4e5c8e928","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
