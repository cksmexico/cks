However, it failed to show a benefit over placebo for the critical outcome of pain.</li></ul></li><li>The guideline committee agreed that choice of analgesic tends to be based on individual effectiveness as well as the person’s risk profile, tolerance, and adverse effects and agreed that its recommendations should not change the current individualised approach to analgesic drug choice.
