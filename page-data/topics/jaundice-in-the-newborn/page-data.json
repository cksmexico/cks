A raised level of bilirubin in the circulation is known as hyperbilirubinaemia.</li><ul><li>Bilirubin levels are higher in neonates than in adults, partly because newborn babies have a higher concentration of red blood cells, which also have a shorter lifespan.</li></ul><li>For most babies, jaundice is harmless ('physiological jaundice') and is not an indication of an underlying disease. Physiological jaundice can occur in breastfed and formula-fed babies. Breastmilk jaundice is a prolongation of physiological jaundice in breastfed babies.</li><li>Pathological neonatal jaundice can be caused by a number of factors, including: blood group incompatibility; sepsis; bruising; metabolic disorders; Gilbert's syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome; glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency; and congenital obstruction and malformations of the biliary system, such as biliary atresia.</li><li>Neurological complications in neonates with jaundice are rare.</li><ul><li>Acute bilirubin encephalopathy is a clinical syndrome thatÂ occurs when there is severe hyperbilirubinaemia. Features include lethargy, irritability, poor suck, abnormal muscle tone and posture (opisthotonus), high-pitched cry, apnoea, and eventually seizures and coma.</li><li>Chronic bilirubin encephalopathy describes the clinical features resulting from acute encephalopathy. These include athetoid cerebral palsy, seizures, developmental delay, learning difficulties, vision and hearing problems, and dental dysplasia.</li></ul><li>The prognosis for babies with jaundice due to an underlying condition depends on the cause. Physiological jaundice is generally harmless and resolves by 2 weeks of age.</li><li>To diagnose neonatal jaundice, the baby should be examined in bright, preferably natural light. If there is doubt about the diagnosis, referral to a neonatologist or paediatrician (depending on local availability) for further assessment should be considered.</li><li>An assessment should be undertaken to determine the extent of jaundice and identify an underlying cause, if possible. However, visual assessment should not be used to assess the severity of hyperbilirubinaemia.</li><li>Neonates with features of bilirubin encephalopathy should be admitted to hospital as an emergency.</li><li>Neonates who are jaundiced at less than 24 hours of age should be urgently admitted to a neonatal or paediatric unit within 2 hours.</li><li>Urgency of referral of other jaundiced neonates will depend on a number of factors, but all neonates for whom jaundice appeared after 24 hours of age should have their bilirubin level measured within 6 hours.</li><li>Secondary care investigations and management will vary depending on the suspected cause, but options for treatment include observation, treatment of underlying illness, phototherapy, exchange transfusion, or surgical treatment.</li></ul><!-- end field cee9eb78-e34b-40ee-a406-4092288514e1 --><!-- end item b5dc6b2a-5b54-4deb-8ee4-861bd3d0c7f3 -->","topic":{"id":"bf00ae7e-a988-5068-8b6d-4fa8673ea75c","topicId":"3e95a5e1-fd00-41d7-aede-2e1615f0e4f5","topicName":"Jaundice in the newborn","slug":"jaundice-in-the-newborn","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"e03f3701-70c5-5aa8-b5b3-33c7b46b5b85","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"d28ae602-6475-5d94-b91c-21e825b56ea3","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"5b92dbaa-247a-5633-b4fa-b9530de1da63","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"89afb74e-dd65-50bd-8fc6-da38be01b4ef","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"1861aabf-aad3-5e53-9c4b-2acad33123dd","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"c459c810-6291-53bb-a937-2860c2e53ab8","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"6b34c0e0-e8d2-5625-b3bf-13063b71fcf2","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"3ede674e-8482-56e9-a1ec-c6bd2bd3b178","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"747f84ef-bea6-5527-b845-50471a0382e7","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"4db0b04d-1878-5762-ac38-afb7aa31eccf","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"8e360167-b216-5bab-a38b-f9da6552b86d","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
