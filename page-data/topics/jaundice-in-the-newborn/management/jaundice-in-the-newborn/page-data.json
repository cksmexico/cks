Physiological and breastmilk jaundice usually appear within the first week of life [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-the-newborn/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2010</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-the-newborn/references/\">Queensland Health, 2019</a>].</li></ul><h5>Unwell babies</h5><ul><li>The NICE guideline <em>Postnatal care up to 8 weeks after birth</em> recommends measuring a serum bilirubin level if a baby is significantly jaundiced or appears unwell [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-the-newborn/references/\">NICE, 2015</a>]. CKS has pragmatically recommended referral of unwell babies with jaundice as the resources and expertise to perform the investigations necessary to exclude underlying conditions and guide treatment are unlikely to be available in primary care.</li></ul><h5>Gestational age less than 35 weeks </h5><ul><li>The NICE guideline <em>Jaundice in newborn babies under 28 days</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-the-newborn/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>] recommends using a transcutaneous bilirubinometer to measure the bilirubin level in babies with a gestational age of 35 weeks or more, but states that serum bilirubin measurement should be used in babies less than 35 weeks gestational age.</li><li>The opinion of the guideline development group was also that babies at less than 35 weeks gestation are more vulnerable than term babies to kernicterus at relatively low levels of bilirubin and therefore need more accurate testing, and that the evidence for accuracy of transcutaneous bilirubinometers in babies at less than 35 weeks gestation is unclear.</li><li>CKS therefore recommends that babies born at less than 35 weeks gestation require referral to secondary care to assess their serum bilirubin level.</li></ul><h5>Prolonged jaundice</h5><ul><li>Referral of babies with prolonged jaundice is recommended on the basis of expert opinion within the NICE guideline <em>Jaundice in newborn babies under 28 days</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-the-newborn/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>]. This states that babies with prolonged jaundice (gestational age of 37 weeks or more with jaundice lasting more than 14 days; or babies with a gestational age of less than 37 weeks and jaundice lasting more than 21 days) should have a number of tests to exclude underlying causes (including conjugated bilirubin level, full blood count, blood group determination and DAT [Coombs' test], urine culture, and metabolic screening).</li></ul><h5>Poor feeding and concerns about weight</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on expert opinion that poor feeding, dehydration, and a reduction in caloric intake below the optimal intake for age can exacerbate jaundice in neonates [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-the-newborn/references/\">Barrington, 2007</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-the-newborn/references/\">Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-the-newborn/references/\">Queensland Health, 2019</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-the-newborn/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2020</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion suggests that jaundice in a breastfed infant who is not feeding well is potentially serious as it can lead to dehydration, malnutrition, and high bilirubin levels, increasing the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy. Inadequate intake of breastmilk can cause a reduction in stool output, leading to increased resorption of bilirubin from the gut [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-the-newborn/references/\">Preer, 2011</a>].</li></ul><h5>Pale stools and dark urine</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to refer is based on expert opinion that pale stools and dark urine can be an indicator of liver disease such as biliary atresia where bile is not excreted from the liver and bile duct into the intestine [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-the-newborn/references/\">Queensland Health, 2019</a>].</li></ul><h5>Use of a transcutaneous bilirubinometer </h5><ul><li>NICE recommends that transcutaneous bilirubin measurement is suitable for babies over 24 hours old and with a gestational age of 35 weeks or more [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-the-newborn/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>]. This is based on evidence that transcutaneous bilirubinometer measurements are adequately accurate in term babies below treatment levels (bilirubin less than 250 micromol/L) and the guideline development group's opinion that the evidence for accuracy of transcutaneous bilirubinometers in babies at less than 35 weeks gestation is unclear [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-the-newborn/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2010</a>].</li><li>It is recommended that serum bilirubin should be measured if a transcutaneous bilirubinometer is not available [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-the-newborn/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>]. CKS is aware that transcutaneous bilirubinometers are not always available in the community and has therefore recommended referral to secondary care for measurement of serum bilirubin level if this is the case. Expert opinion from previous reviewers of this CKS topic supports this, with reviewers emphasizing the inaccuracy of visual assessment of jaundice and warning of its potential to underestimate the serum bilirubin level.</li><li>NICE also recommends that if a transcutaneous bilirubinometer measurement indicates a bilirubin level greater than 250 micromol/litre, serum bilirubin should be measured to check the result [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-the-newborn/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>].</li></ul><h5>Reassurance and advice</h5><ul><li>NICE states that parents and carers should be offered verbal and written advice that is tailored to their needs and concerns, with care taken to avoid unnecessary anxiety [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-the-newborn/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>]. CKS has therefore provided links to various reputable sources of information about jaundice, breastfeeding, and neonatal care.</li></ul><h5>Secondary care investigations and management</h5><ul><li>The information on potential investigations and management strategies for neonatal jaundice in secondary care is based on expert opinion in the NICE guideline <em>Jaundice in newborn babies under 28 days</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-the-newborn/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>], the Queensland Maternity and Neonatal Clinical Guideline <em>Neonatal jaundice</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-the-newborn/references/\">Queensland Health, 2019</a>], the BMJ Best Practice guideline <em>Neonatal jaundice</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-the-newborn/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2020</a>], and the review articles <em>Understanding and managing breast milk jaundice</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-the-newborn/references/\">Preer, 2011</a>] and <em>Evaluation and treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-the-newborn/references/\">Muchowski, 2014</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field e9cc1cf0-e4e5-4688-bdf3-d6b37549ecbf --><!-- end item 07147e17-c303-43e7-85df-232e00b8797d -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
