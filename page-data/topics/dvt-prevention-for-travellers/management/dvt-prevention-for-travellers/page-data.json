guideline <em>Prevention and management of venous thromboembolism</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dvt-prevention-for-travellers/references/\">SIGN, 2014</a>], the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) health information for travellers <em>The yellow book: Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dvt-prevention-for-travellers/references/\">CDC, 2017</a>], the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) <em>Guidelines on travel-related venous thrombosis</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dvt-prevention-for-travellers/references/\">Watson and Baglin, 2011</a>] and expert opinion in a consensus statement <em>Traveller's thrombosis: International consensus statement</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dvt-prevention-for-travellers/references/\">Schobersberger et al, 2008</a>].</p><h5>Assessment of risks</h5><ul><li>The duration of travel and pre-existing risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) should be taken into account when assessing the risk of DVT in travellers, as the risk of travel-related thrombosis is higher in individuals with pre-existing risk factors for the development for venous thromboembolism (VTE), and travel of 3 hours and over is associated with a thrombotic risk [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dvt-prevention-for-travellers/references/\">Watson and Baglin, 2011</a>].  </li><li>The risk of symptomatic venous thrombosis after air travel is moderately increased on average, and rises with increasing exposure and in high-risk groups [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dvt-prevention-for-travellers/references/\">Kuipers et al, 2007</a>]. </li><li>The risk of VTE is increased after longer journeys [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dvt-prevention-for-travellers/references/\">Schobersberger et al, 2008</a>]. <ul><li>There is a four-fold increase in risk for air-travel over 8 hours and the risk increases markedly for journeys in excess of 12 hours. </li></ul></li></ul><h5>Risk stratification</h5><ul><li>An international consensus statement proposed three levels of risk (low, medium, or high) for travel-related DVT based on the presence or absence of pre-disposing factors [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dvt-prevention-for-travellers/references/\">Schobersberger et al, 2008</a>]. </li><li>The BCSH guideline states that it is likely that recent major surgery (within 1 month), active malignancy, previous unprovoked VTE, previous travel-related VTE with no associated temporary risk factor or presence of more than one risk factor identifies those travellers at highest thrombosis risk [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dvt-prevention-for-travellers/references/\">Watson and Baglin, 2011</a>]. </li><li>VTE is a multicausal disorder and the accumulation of risk factors added to an individual’s inherent thrombotic risk determines whether or not thrombosis develops [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dvt-prevention-for-travellers/references/\">Watson and Baglin, 2011</a>]. </li><li>The recommendation that somebody who has a risk factor, but is not at high risk, is considered at moderate risk is pragmatic and based on what CKS considers good clinical practice.<ul><li>Clinical judgement should be used to determine the risk of travel-related DVT based on travel duration and the presence of any risk factors.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 0cb5f0d5-7a00-4ae8-af8b-95f47127c445 --><!-- end item

absence of clear evidence of benefit, and passengers should be advised not to use aspirin specifically for the prevention of travel-related deep vein thrombosis (DVT) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dvt-prevention-for-travellers/references/\">WHO, 2012</a>].  </li><li>Where pharmacological prophylaxis is indicated, anticoagulants as opposed to antiplatelets are recommended based on the observation that in other clinical scenarios they provide more effective thromboprophylaxis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dvt-prevention-for-travellers/references/\">Watson and Baglin, 2011</a>]. </li><li>In cases where the potential benefits of pharmacologic prophylaxis outweigh the possible adverse effects, anticoagulants rather than antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin) are recommended [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dvt-prevention-for-travellers/references/\">CDC, 2017</a>]. </li></ul><h5>For people already prescribed aspirin for cardiovascular protection</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to advise people not to increase the dose of aspirin if they are already taking it for cardiovascular protection is pragmatic, as:<ul><li>There is no clear evidence of benefit in taking aspirin for prevention of travel-related DVT.</li><li>Increasing the dose increases the risk of adverse effects.</li><li>The optimal dose range of aspirin for cardiovascular protection is 75–100 mg. For more information see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/antiplatelet-treatment/\">Antiplatelet treatment</a>.</li></ul></li><li>CKS found no guidance on managing low-dose aspirin therapy for these people if low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is indicated. Feedback from CKS expert reviewers generally indicated that aspirin for cardiovascular protection should be continued, taking into account the increased risk of bleeding. Consequently, CKS advises seeking specialist advice when LMWH is indicated for people prescribed aspirin for cardiovascular protection.</li></ul><!-- end field 0196c608-8bc6-4f35-9b66-584fea129720 --><!-- end item 4378a0df-ca44-4d80-9fa7-1e0037eef364 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
