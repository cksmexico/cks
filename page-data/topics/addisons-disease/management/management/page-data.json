Dosage depends on body weight, metabolism, and absorption.</li><li>Ideally glucocorticoid replacement should resemble the natural cycle of corticosteroid release. Three divided doses are usually given (for example 10 mg on waking, 5 mg at noon, and 5 mg in the early evening), as this aims to provide even levels of glucocorticoid throughout the day. Two divided doses are also an option (for example 15 mg in the morning, and 10 mg in the afternoon or early evening), but this may lead to more variation in cortisol levels.</li><li>For people doing shift work, doses of glucocorticoid should follow the person's daily routine, not the time on the clock. For example, the first dose should be given on getting up after sleep, even if this is not in the morning.</li><li>For children, daily dosage is usually around 8–10 mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area in three to four divided doses.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Mineralocorticoid replacement</strong> — fludrocortisone is usually used to replace aldosterone.<ul><li>For adults, the daily adult dosage of fludrocortisone is usually 50–200 micrograms. Dosage depends on metabolism and exercise levels and varies across the person’s lifespan.</li><li>Children have a much higher mineralocorticoid requirement (dosage depends on the age and weight of the child and the severity of the condition), and they may need salt supplementation.</li><li>At high temperatures and humidity, the fludrocortisone dose may need to be increased to compensate for the increased salt loss from sweating.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Androgen replacement </strong>— dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is an androgen made in the adrenal cortex; therefore, levels are decreased in Addison's disease.<ul><li>DHEA replacement (unlicensed) may be prescribed in certain circumstances (such as persistent fatigue) by endocrinology.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field
