is often delayed because symptoms are non-specific, common, and overlap with many <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/addisons-disease/diagnosis/differential-diagnosis/\">other conditions</a>.</strong><ul><li>More than half of people with Addison's disease have symptoms and signs for more than 1 year before diagnosis.</li></ul></li><li><strong>A person with Addison's disease may present with a sudden crisis precipitated by intercurrent infection or stress.</strong><ul><li>Features may include hypotension, hypovolaemic shock, delirium, reduced consciousness, acute abdominal pain, vomiting, headache, low-grade fever, and muscle weakness.</li><li>Hypoglycaemia can also occur (in particular in children).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Also consider Addison's disease in a person with:</strong><ul><li>Persistent, non-specific clinical features, such as:<ul><li>Fatigue — this affects most people with Addison's disease.</li><li>Hyperpigmentation (due to increased pituitary adrenocorticotrophic hormone) — this affects about 80% of people with Addison's disease, particularly in sun-exposed areas, recent scars, pressure points, areas of friction (such as the waistline), palmar creases, and mucous membranes.</li><li>Gastrointestinal symptoms for example weight loss, loss of appetite and premature satiety, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, and/or cravings for salt.</li><li>Musculoskeletal symptoms for example muscle weakness (difficulty getting up from sitting or carrying weights), muscle cramps (due to electrolyte derangement), and joint pain.</li><li>Cardiovascular symptoms including postural dizziness due to hypotension (blood pressure decrease of 20 mmHg between sitting and standing measurements).</li><li>Other symptoms including headache, low-grade fever, increased thirst or urination, loss of axillary or pubic hair in women, and anxiety or depression.</li></ul></li><li>Hypothyroidism where symptoms worsen when levothyroxine is started — elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone in isolation may indicate hypoadrenalism.</li><li>Type 1 diabetes mellitus and recurrent unexplained hypoglycaemic episodes.</li><li>Other autoimmune diseases, such as vitiligo, pernicious anaemia, chronic active hepatitis, alopecia, and coeliac disease.</li><li>Hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia on blood biochemistry — hyponatraemia is present in around 70–80% and hyperkalaemia in 30–40% of people with Addison's disease.</li></ul></li><li><strong>In children, presenting features may also include prolonged neonatal jaundice, failure to thrive, or delayed puberty.</strong></li></ul><!-- end field
