This results in reduced production of glucocorticoids (such as cortisol), mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone), and adrenal androgens (such as dehydroepiandrosterone).<ul><li>Adrenal insufficiency may also be caused by long-term administration of corticosteroids or disorders of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, but this is not Addison's disease.</li></ul></li><li>In western countries, Addison's disease is most commonly caused by autoimmunity (around 90% of cases).<ul><li>Other causes of primary adrenal insufficiency include congenital adrenal hyperplasia and infections such as tuberculosis.</li></ul></li><li>Addison's disease is rare. In the UK, there are approximately 9000 prevalent diagnosed cases with 320 new diagnoses per year.</li><li>Diagnosis of Addison's disease is often delayed because symptoms are non-specific, common, and overlap with many other conditions.</li><li>A person with Addison's disease may present with a sudden crisis precipitated by intercurrent illness or other stress. Features include hypotension, hypovolaemic shock, acute abdominal pain, vomiting, and reduced level of consciousness.<ul><li>If adrenal crisis is suspected, the person is acutely unwell or hypotensive, emergency admission should be arranged — untreated adrenal crisis can be rapidly fatal.</li><li>Hydrocortisone intramuscularly or intravenously should be administered before transfer to hospital.</li><li>Emergency treatment should never be delayed to carry out investigations.</li></ul></li><li>Addison's disease should also be considered in people with:<ul><li>Persistent, non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, hyperpigmentation, gastrointestinal symptoms, salt craving, postural hypotension, or muscle weakness or cramps.</li><li>Hypothyroidism if symptoms worsen when thyroxine is started.</li><li>Type 1 diabetes mellitus with recurrent unexplained hypoglycaemic episodes.</li><li>Other autoimmune conditions.</li><li>Low sodium and high potassium levels on blood biochemistry.</li></ul></li><li>In adults, if adrenal insufficiency is suspected (and urgent admission not indicated) investigations such as 9 am serum cortisol and urea and electrolytes should be considered. As a general guide:<ul><li>If the serum cortisol level is less than 100 nanomol/L, the person should be admitted to hospital. Adrenal insufficiency is highly likely.</li><li>If the serum cortisol level is 100–500 nanomol/L, the person should be referred to endocrinology for further investigations.</li></ul></li><li>In children, investigations should be urgently carried out in secondary care if adrenal insufficiency is suspected — admission to hospital may be required depending on the clinical picture.</li><li>Diagnosis of Addison's disease is confirmed in secondary care with an adrenocorticotrophic hormone stimulation (Synacthen<sup>®</sup>) test.</li><li>If untreated, Addison's disease is always fatal — lifelong treatment is essential.</li><li>Treatment for Addison's disease is initiated and adjusted by a specialist endocrinologist; repeat prescriptions may be provided in primary care under a shared care arrangement.<ul><li>Hydrocortisone is usually used for glucocorticoid replacement and fludrocortisone for mineralocorticoid replacement.</li><li>Dehydroepiandrosterone (unlicensed) may be prescribed by some specialists for androgen replacement.</li></ul></li><li>It is important for people with Addison's disease to:<ul><li>Increase their corticosteroid cover during physical stress, such as illness, injury, or surgery to prevent adrenal crisis.</li><li>Recognize the symptoms of an adrenal crisis and know how to give intramuscular hydrocortisone in an emergency.</li><li>Carry emergency information on their person such as a steroid treatment card and MedicAlert identification.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 1771d0da-3135-488a-bae1-bf4437b073c5 --><!-- end item 9e9ec46f-c6c0-4b90-bd7c-ee947cfb16b2 -->","topic":{"id":"85552d74-8915-56ec-961e-2cbd611bb10a","topicId":"b9b069a1-e345-435c-8996-0f9b9532b3b3","topicName":"Addison's disease","slug":"addisons-disease","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"5bb9a13a-2651-51da-9586-419b958fc24f","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"d1ae168c-5219-526e-967a-65c44cfe1635","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"1e817e04-330a-5085-a1a4-705eedbc89f4","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"ddd590cd-acdd-5ec5-8adc-56c10d49145e","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"904ce186-aff5-51bf-a48a-7302aa46f685","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"6dbcee75-0365-5555-a1cd-832f4af24189","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"e1642c54-2720-5915-a5be-5fd600b124ca","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"7825ef20-439f-5a33-a1ae-2d755d692128","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"2e7aa18d-cc25-541c-ab7f-4b19f3d06de0","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"db1986d0-14c7-5a6c-969a-00655c4a668f","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"81632eb8-f3bc-567b-8133-c41a4d4a4fa2","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
