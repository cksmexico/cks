href=\"/topics/faltering-growth/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>] considers weight loss in the first few days of life separately to inadequate weight gain in older infants and children:<ul><li>Some weight loss in the first days after birth is normal and usually associated with body fluid adjustments [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/faltering-growth/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li><li>However, if assessment reveals abnormal/concerning features, further assessment and intervention is required [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/faltering-growth/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Early weight loss</h5><ul><li>The recommendations that birth weight should typically be regained by 3 weeks of age and that a threshold of 10% weight loss in the first few days after birth should be used to identify infants where weight is a cause for concern is taken from the NICE guideline on Faltering growth [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/faltering-growth/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].<ul><li>For a full description of the evidence used in the generation of this recommendation see the <a data-hyperlink-id=\"54019ae8-98aa-4547-ba8a-a8f70098d400\" href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng75/evidence\"
