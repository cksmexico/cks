minutes).</li><li>Eating together as a family (or with other children) and establishing regular eating schedules (for example, 3 meals and 2-3 snacks in a day).</li><li>Encouraging young children to feed themselves and allowing young children to be 'messy' with their food.</li><li>Serving nutrient-rich, healthy food, appropriate to the child's developmental stage in terms of quantity, type and food texture.</li><li>Setting reasonable boundaries for mealtime behaviour while avoiding punitive approaches and coercive feeding.</li><li>Avoidance of too many energy-dense drinks, including milk as these can reduce a child's appetite for other food.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>In all children with faltering growth:<ul><li>Consider the need for referral to a paediatric dietician, clinical psychologist, speech and language therapist with expertise in feeding and eating difficulties, occupational therapist, school nurse, or social services, depending on the specific clinical situation.</li><li>Arrange follow up to monitor growth with re-assessment frequency dependant on the specific clinical situation — measure and record the weight at appropriate intervals taking account of factors such as age and the level of concern, but usually no more often than:<ul><li>Monthly from 1 year of age.</li><li>Fortnightly between 6–12 months.</li><li>Weekly between 1–6 months old.</li><li>Daily if less than 1 month old.</li></ul></li><li>Be aware that recovery in weight gain usually begins within four to eight weeks of a successful intervention (such as dietary advice) and may take several months.</li><li>If a child with faltering growth develops new clinical features after the initial assessment, reconsider whether discussion with/referral to paediatrics is needed.</li></ul></li><li>If measures in primary care fail, discuss further management with paediatrics.</li></ul><!-- end field 3c08105a-21bf-412f-9075-a8e200b7dc24 --><!-- end item

review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/faltering-growth/references/\">Corbett, 2004</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\"

href=\"/topics/faltering-growth/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2018</a>] is that weight loss is unusual except in the early days of life and early identification and management are needed to reduce the risk of long-term complications.</li></ul><h5>Fluid intake</h5><ul><li>NICE recommend that usual liquid intake should be reviewed, as drinking too much milk or too many energy-dense drinks, may suppress the child’s appetite and stop the child eating food at regular times [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/faltering-growth/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li><li>The American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) recommends that juice should not be offered to infants under the age of 12 months as it provides no nutritional benefits and can predispose to inappropriate weight gain (too much or too little). The AAP recommended that juice consumption in children aged 4 to 6 years is limited to 170 millilitres per day and in children aged 7 to 18 years to 227 millilitres per day [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/faltering-growth/references/\">Heyman, 2017</a>].</li></ul><h5>Intervals for monitoring</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on intervals for monitoring are based on the NICE guideline — the Guideline Committee recognises wide variation in current practice and made recommendations based on a review of potential benefits and harms from excessive or insufficient measurement.<ul><li>Weighing children more frequently than is needed may add to parental anxiety (for example minor short-term changes may lead to unnecessary concern) or unnecessary referral. Weighing children too infrequently may mean that growth faltering is not picked up and treated early leading to avoidable complications [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/faltering-growth/references/\">King, 2010</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/faltering-growth/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Referral</h5><ul><li>NICE recommends that in general infants or children with faltering growth should not be admitted to hospital unless they are acutely unwell or there is a specific indication requiring inpatient care, such as a plan to begin tube feeding [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/faltering-growth/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li><li>Input from a paediatric dietician allows for the appropriate calculation of caloric requirements based upon current and ideal weight and usual calories required for age [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/faltering-growth/references/\">Bergman, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/faltering-growth/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/faltering-growth/references/\">Shields, 2012</a>] is that in addition to suspected child maltreatment and social problems (such as substance abuse) referral to social services for extra support is also appropriate for families who lack resources to provide children with adequate nutrition.</li></ul><h5>Importance of involving the multidisciplinary team (MDT)</h5><ul><li>Expert opinion in guidelines and review articles agrees on the importance of involvement of the MDT (for example midwife, health visitor, dietitian, social worker, lactation specialist, paediatrician) in assessment and management of faltering growth [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/faltering-growth/references/\">Homan, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/faltering-growth/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field 75c85c6b-1267-42ab-adb0-a8e200b7dc24 --><!-- end item 194a23e2-2c5b-4c23-b442-a8e200b7dc24 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
