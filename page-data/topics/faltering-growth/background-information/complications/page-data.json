The authors concluded that this was of questionable clinical significance [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/faltering-growth/references/\">Rudolf, 2005</a>].</li><li>A meta-analysis of cases of failure to thrive in infancy identified in secondary care (52 cases, 36 controls) found a pooled effect size (weighted standardised mean difference) for cognitive outcomes of -0.85 (95% CI -0.41 to -1.30). The pooled effect size in cases identified in primary care (552 cases, 573 controls) was -0.30 (95% CI -0.18 to -0.42). In longitudinal studies testing the same children at different ages the effect size was smaller when the children were older. The overall estimate of long-term cognitive outcome of failure to thrive in infancy was found to be 4.2 IQ points (95% CI 2 to 6) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/faltering-growth/references/\">Corbett, 2004</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/faltering-growth/references/\">Perrin, 2003</a>;
