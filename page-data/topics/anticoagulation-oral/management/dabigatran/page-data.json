Regular follow-up assessment is useful, especially for people with comorbidities (such as renal failure, older age, multiple comorbidities, or frailty).</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Renal function tests</h5><ul><li>Regular renal function tests are required as approximately 80% of dabigatran is excreted renally. Exposure to dabigatran is substantially increased in people with renal insufficiency, leading to an increased risk of bleeding. The EHRA advises that renal function should be monitored every 6 months if the person is frail or aged over 75 years, or more frequently if creatinine clearance (CrCl) is less than 60 mL/minute [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/anticoagulation-oral/references/\">Steffel, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Bleeding risk</h5><ul><li>The MHRA reminds healthcare professionals to remain vigilant for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications during treatment with dabigatran after ongoing reports of serious, potentially fatal bleeds associated with the use of DOACs. Healthcare professionals are advised to use dabigatran with caution in people with increased bleeding risk and to ensure that those with renal impairment are dosed appropriately and their renal function monitored during treatment. People should be counselled on the signs and symptoms of bleeding and encouraged to read the patient information leaflet [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/anticoagulation-oral/references/\">MHRA, 2020a</a>].</li><li>The SPCs and the BNF state that, as with other anticoagulants, people taking dabigatran should be carefully monitored for signs of bleeding and treatment should be discontinued if bleeding occurs [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/anticoagulation-oral/references/\">ABPI, 2020a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/anticoagulation-oral/references/\">ABPI, 2020c</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/anticoagulation-oral/references/\">Joint Formulary Committee, 2020</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field dcb9e26b-3735-40b1-ad7e-f894a685e6a4 --><!-- end item 3a0886dc-a475-48af-be70-f2d5b074016f -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"4a475241-01d1-5209-b857-7ecb24aa31b6","slug":"monitoring-during-the-covid-19-pandemic","fullItemName":"Monitoring during the Covid-19 pandemic","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field bbbbf7da-a162-4ba7-914e-acb401762b5d --><h3>How should I monitor a person taking dabigatran during the COVID-19 pandemic?</h3><!-- end field bbbbf7da-a162-4ba7-914e-acb401762b5d -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item e04e7e1b-9278-4452-9379-f7de4e192402 --><!-- begin field ab78de09-2223-47f1-8769-acb401762b5d --><ul><li><strong>When monitoring a person taking dabigatran during the COVID-19 pandemic, remember that:</strong><br><ul><li>Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as dabigatran, may <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/anticoagulation-oral/management/dabigatran/#drug-interactions\">interact</a> with other medicines, including antibacterials and antivirals.
