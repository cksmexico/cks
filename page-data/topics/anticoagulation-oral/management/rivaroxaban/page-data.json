However, treatment should be reviewed on a regular basis, preferably after 1 month initially and at least every 3 months thereafter. As clinical experience with these medications grows, follow-up intervals may become longer, based on individual (patient-specific) or local (centre-specific) factors. (The EHRA guideline gives a recommended follow-up interval of 1–6 months.)</li><li>The absence of a need for routine plasma level monitoring means that people taking DOACs are likely to be less frequently seen for follow-up appointments than people on warfarin treatment. Regular follow-up assessment is useful, especially for people with comorbidities (such as renal failure, older age, multiple comorbidities, or frailty).</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Renal function tests</h5><ul><li>Regular renal function tests are required as approximately 35% of rivaroxaban is excreted renally. Exposure to rivaroxaban is substantially increased in people with renal insufficiency, leading to an increased risk of bleeding. The EHRA advises that renal function should be monitored every 6 months if the person is frail or aged over 75 years, or more frequently if the creatinine clearance (CrCl) is less than 60 mL/minute [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/anticoagulation-oral/references/\">Steffel, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Bleeding risk</h5><ul><li>The MHRA reminds healthcare professionals to remain vigilant for signs and symptoms of bleeding complications during treatment with rivaroxaban after ongoing reports of serious, potentially fatal bleeds associated with the use of DOACs. Healthcare professionals are advised to use rivaroxaban with caution in people with increased bleeding risk and to ensure that those with renal impairment are dosed appropriately and their renal function monitored during treatment.
