Some tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and mirtazapine should also be avoided due to an enhanced anticoagulant effect.

Changes in liver function, secondary to hepatitis C treatment with direct-acting antivirals, may affect the efficacy of warfarin because of possible changes in liver function during treatment. Direct-acting antiviral medications include boceprevir (Victrelis®), daclatasvir (Daklinza®), dasabuvir (Exviera®), ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (Viekirax®), sofosbuvir (Sovaldi®), ledipasvir with sofosbuvir (Harvoni®), and simeprevir (Olysio®). </li><li><strong>Fibrates </strong>— avoid concurrent use if possible, or reduce the warfarin dose as necessary.</li><li><strong>Glucosamine </strong>— avoid concurrent use.</li><li><strong>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</strong> (NSAIDs) — avoid concurrent use, or reduce warfarin dose as necessary.

In addition, the person must be counselled on the signs of gastrointestinal bleeding. </li><li><strong>Tamoxifen </strong>— avoid concurrent use, or reduce warfarin dose as necessary.

St John's wort can cause a moderate clinical reduction in the anticoagulant effect.</li><li><strong>Griseofulvin </strong>— increase warfarin dose as necessary.</li><li><strong>Rifampicin </strong>— increase warfarin dose as necessary.</li><li><strong>Carbamazepine </strong>— increase warfarin dose as necessary.</li><li><strong>Phenobarbital or primidone </strong>— a reduced effect may be seen within 2–4 days (maximum effect by about 3 weeks) after starting phenobarbital and persisting for up to 6 weeks after phenobarbital is stopped.

After stopping phenytoin, the INR may continue to be affected for up to 6 weeks.</li><li><strong>Vitamin K-containing vitamin complexes,</strong> including some enteral feeds (containing vitamin K), mineral supplements, and green vegetables (as well as over-the-counter chilblain products) — the warfarin dose should be increased, or the intake of vitamin K reduced. Vitamin K-rich diets should not be changed without at the same time reducing the warfarin dose, because excessive anticoagulation and bleeding may occur.</li></ul></li><li><strong>In addition, it is also prudent to monitor the INR when warfarin is used concurrently with the following drugs, especially in older people, as interactions have been documented:</strong><ul><li>Allopurinol.</li><li>Azathioprine.</li><li>Grapefruit juice (it may be easier to completely avoid this).</li><li>Influenza vaccine.</li><li>Methylphenidate.</li><li>Orlistat (may reduce the absorption of vitamin K).</li><li>Paracetamol or paracetamol-containing products (particularly if prolonged regular use).</li><li>Proton pump inhibitors.</li><li>Quinolone antibiotics.</li><li>Statins (particularly fluvastatin or rosuvastatin; not pravastatin).</li><li>Stopping smoking (it takes about 1 week for enzyme induction due to smoking to wear off).</li><li>Zafirlukast.</li></ul></li><li>See the <a href=\"http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc\" data-hyperlink-id=\"bf6bda62-14be-48b6-a3bd-a98d000d45b6\">electronic Medicines Compendium</a> (eMC) or the <a href=\"https://bnf.nice.org.uk/\" data-hyperlink-id=\"f811dbb2-4c9a-4436-be05-a98d000d462f\">British National Formulary</a> (BNF) for other possible drug interactions with warfarin.</li></ul><!-- end field d12694b1-0459-4596-b645-bcb7a5db0ab4 --><!-- end item 8a94a581-1161-42e8-9234-1dcc857cc2e6 -->","subChapters":[{"id":"6e5bbb81-6771-546b-91a6-3ed2d69b1032","slug":"basis-for-recommendation-96c","fullItemName":"Basis for recommendation","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field e84f931b-dac5-4c0b-b39c-46043e67c85c --><h4>Basis for recommendation</h4><!-- end field e84f931b-dac5-4c0b-b39c-46043e67c85c -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 96c5ed08-82cf-4337-aab6-b4cc9224731b --><!-- begin field 03b2cf48-0ca8-4880-a9b0-67d4b4c5a976 --><p>These recommendations are based on the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) <em>Guidelines on oral anticoagulation with warfarin - fourth edition</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/anticoagulation-oral/references/\">Keeling, 2011</a>], the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for warfarin sodium 1 mg/1 ml oral suspension [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/anticoagulation-oral/references/\">ABPI, 2020f</a>], the British National Formulary (BNF) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/anticoagulation-oral/references/\">Joint Formulary Committee, 2020</a>], the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) drug safety updates <em>Topical miconazole, including oral gel: reminder of potential for serious interactions with warfarin </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/anticoagulation-oral/references/\">MHRA, 2016b</a>] and <em>Direct-acting antivirals to treat chronic hepatitis C: risk of interaction with vitamin K antagonists and changes in INR </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/anticoagulation-oral/references/\">MHRA, 2017</a>], and information in a medical textbook [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/anticoagulation-oral/references/\">Preston, 2015</a>].</p><!-- end field 03b2cf48-0ca8-4880-a9b0-67d4b4c5a976 --><!-- end item 96c5ed08-82cf-4337-aab6-b4cc9224731b -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"a2adaae9-0d5e-53d1-ba93-898d9f4cb939","slug":"surgery-dental-treatment","fullItemName":"Surgery and dental treatment","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 6c7dd5cf-9f97-487e-9a50-50801213d3fe --><h3>Should warfarin be stopped before planned surgery or dental treatment?</h3><!-- end field 6c7dd5cf-9f97-487e-9a50-50801213d3fe -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item d5f23a43-6c3a-499e-b381-af942d8adf6e --><!-- begin field b8cba69b-0e40-45d7-9451-6d919bc41dbb --><ul><li><strong>If the person needs to have surgery or any other invasive procedure, they may need to temporarily stop taking warfarin.</strong></li><li><strong>Minor surgical procedures with low risk of bleeding</strong> can be performed in general with an international normalized ratio (INR) of less than 2.5.
