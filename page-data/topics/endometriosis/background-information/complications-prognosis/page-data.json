These may rupture and can affect fertility by causing distortion of pelvic anatomy.</li><li>Fertility problems — endometriosis is commonly associated with infertility, with a prevalence of 25–40% in infertile women compared with 0.5–5% in fertile women [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/endometriosis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>]. The mechanisms linking endometriosis and infertility are poorly understood, and causation is not established. Severe disease can lead to tubal adhesions (resulting in marked distortion of pelvic anatomy and pelvic pain), reduced ovarian reserve and oocyte and embryo quality, and poor implantation. Endometriosis can also impair fertility by disturbing the function of the fallopian tube, embryo transport, and the eutopic endometrium. Even mild endometriosis can impair fertility [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/endometriosis/references/\">Hickey et al, 2014</a>] . </li><li>Adhesion formation — may occur due to the endometriosis or secondary to surgery or infection, and may cause chronic pelvic pain.</li><li>Bowel obstruction — partial or complete bowel obstruction can occur due to adhesion formation or a circumferential endometriotic deposit. </li><li>Chronic pain — in some women, pain from endometriosis may become chronic even when visible disease has been removed [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/endometriosis/references/\">Hickey et al, 2014</a>].</li><li>Reduced quality of life — symptomatic endometriosis can have a significant and sometimes severe impact on the woman’s quality of life and activities of daily living, including relationships and sexuality, work productivity, fitness, and mental health [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/endometriosis/references/\">Hickey et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/endometriosis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li><li><strong>The prognosis of endometriosis is variable.</strong><ul><li>Endometriosis can be a chronic disease affecting women throughout their reproductive lives (and sometimes beyond). </li><li>For the majority of women, symptoms can be controlled with hormonal treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/endometriosis/references/\">Coleman, 2015</a>]; however, some women may have complex needs and require long-term support [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/endometriosis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li><li>It is unclear whether endometriosis is always progressive, remains stable, or improves with time [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/endometriosis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li><li>Observational studies in untreated women with infertility suggest that endometriotic deposits can spontaneously regress in up to 30% of women, and progress is around 50% over 6–12 months [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/endometriosis/references/\">Hickey et al, 2014</a>].</li><li>Prospective data indicate that recurrence after surgery ranges from 10–50% at one year and increases over time [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/endometriosis/references/\">Hickey et al, 2014</a>].</li></ul></li><li><strong>An association between endometriosis and ovarian cancer has been suggested in previous studies</strong><strong>. </strong>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) undertook a systematic review to determine whether there is an increased risk of cancer of reproductive organs in women with endometriosis compared with those without endometriosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/endometriosis/references/\">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2017</a>]:<ul><li>The Committee concluded that no recommendations should be made based on the available evidence.</li><li>The most consistent results were related to a possible small increased risk of ovarian cancer in women with endometriosis compared with women without endometriosis. However, because of evidence limitations and the inability to quantify this risk in absolute terms, the Committee decided against making recommendations after considerable debate. They decided this because the potential harms associated with misinterpretation or overinterpretation of any recommendation based on this data would outweigh any benefits conferred by women being specifically informed about this data, and may lead to unnecessary procedures.</li><li>The Committee agreed that for other types of cancer of reproductive organs, the evidence was negative or inconclusive.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field f3267c62-6bfb-45bf-9ca2-ebd479db03c8 --><!-- end item 7ea63f5c-437f-449e-960c-0a5aa19dda1b -->","topic":{"id":"3eef2de4-2956-51b1-a059-4cbd4139a25b","topicId":"b292df1a-ddc5-4a1d-9b90-185ea19b4e70","topicName":"Endometriosis","slug":"endometriosis","lastRevised":"Last revised in February 2020","chapters":[{"id":"395e6ee5-6371-5176-836b-781aff9c04d6","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"b283df94-e1ac-5c31-8754-e01a285248de","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"6975b1f3-b77b-52cf-8b4d-5c6b3fc69c98","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"9493bc31-622c-53a5-8b99-0bb65dfcfbdf","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"d7bf8cc4-e8cc-5257-b824-cb3ddacabce7","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"f446ba22-a9c2-56c4-878c-b0b0bdac1aff","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"a00e7a73-6f58-5c74-bd34-16e7e1cc4e24","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"1ab4c596-bae4-587c-924f-0eef167e7c05","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"206d9666-9c0e-5d1e-8396-df764b62eed0","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"ac09dd77-b858-58e3-b26f-fa304d1cf972","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"fbdbef3c-8dff-5a5a-9053-b45b6d8131c2","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP - Options for local implementation"},{"id":"2e5f6c6e-45b7-569c-a5e3-c22ba3b58f9e","slug":"nice-quality-standards","fullItemName":"NICE quality standards"}]},{"id":"3a1a2e88-04ae-5e36-959d-dc6038a6add8","fullItemName":"Background information","slug":"background-information","subChapters":[{"id":"b120ad25-5b10-5fb6-bb61-6cb7b7a3cc6d","slug":"definition","fullItemName":"Definition"},{"id":"a4d25028-c2aa-590a-b300-ac339d386deb","slug":"causes-risk-factors","fullItemName":"Causes and risk factors"},{"id":"7fc7c903-bdb8-527f-8d3f-e6f7351f9ce5","slug":"prevalence","fullItemName":"Prevalence"},{"id":"295d176b-2a42-5aab-9041-597768d69e04","slug":"complications-prognosis","fullItemName":"Complications and prognosis"}]},{"id":"91b98eb3-9399-51c0-b3a9-f217fb27b632","fullItemName":"Diagnosis","slug":"diagnosis","subChapters":[{"id":"6e69ef3a-c9fc-5125-8f0d-b3de4181871c","slug":"when-to-suspect-endometriosis","fullItemName":"When to suspect endometriosis"},{"id":"27e4bc58-6ffc-59dc-827f-c9bd03efc267","slug":"differential-diagnosis","fullItemName":"Differential diagnosis"}]},{"id":"ff4f77ef-f0bb-591c-8c52-fc7fe9121986","fullItemName":"Management","slug":"management","subChapters":[{"id":"3ac6ca53-459b-5a16-bc24-873902024f55","slug":"management-of-endometriosis","fullItemName":"Scenario: Management of endometriosis"}]},{"id":"7aefc621-a490-5c6a-accf-f5de72607d6e","fullItemName":"Supporting evidence","slug":"supporting-evidence","subChapters":[]},{"id":"fce9f6b2-26c8-535a-9876-e67581d932f1","fullItemName":"How this topic was developed","slug":"how-this-topic-was-developed","subChapters":[{"id":"13ae1af5-15e0-5e27-ba71-571e1b01f9f0","slug":"search-strategy","fullItemName":"Search strategy"},{"id":"7618ad57-5ba3-52d3-aaeb-901bee04142c","slug":"stakeholder-engagement","fullItemName":"Stakeholder engagement"},{"id":"985b51b0-bbeb-5a26-b82e-79c117fd707c","slug":"evidence-exclusion-criteria","fullItemName":"Evidence exclusion criteria"},{"id":"8b78290d-3b22-53b9-9d50-2d7f5163f6cf","slug":"organizational-behavioural-financial-barriers","fullItemName":"Organizational, behavioural and financial barriers"},{"id":"05170929-c3a6-50cc-9097-47768e1a7162","slug":"declarations-of-interest","fullItemName":"Declarations of interest"}]},{"id":"4d2cb436-2e08-5f24-b0e1-7c76956521c1","fullItemName":"References","slug":"references","subChapters":[]}]},"parentChapter":{"id":"3a1a2e88-04ae-5e36-959d-dc6038a6add8","slug":"background-information","fullItemName":"Background information"},"subChapters":[]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
