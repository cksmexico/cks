Extrapelvic deposits, such as in the bowel and pleural cavity, are rare.</li><li>Endometriosis is associated with menstruation. The hormonal changes in the menstrual cycle induce bleeding, chronic inflammation, and scar tissue formation. </li></ul></li><li>The exact cause of endometriosis is unknown. It is thought that endometriosis develops as a result of a combination of several factors, including retrograde menstruation, personal genetics, metaplasia, and environmental factors. </li><li>Endometriosis is one of the most common gynaecological disorders in women of reproductive age. About 1 in 10 women of reproductive age in the UK have endometriosis.</li><li>Endometriosis can be a chronic disease affecting women throughout their reproductive lives (and sometimes beyond). For most women, symptoms can be controlled with hormonal treatment; however, some women may have complex needs and require long-term support.</li><li>Endometriosis should be suspected in women (including young women aged 17 years and younger) presenting with 1 or more of the following symptoms or signs:<ul><li>Chronic pelvic pain (defined as a minimum of 6 months of cyclical or continuous pain).</li><li>Period-related pain (dysmenorrhoea) affecting daily activities and quality of life.</li><li>Deep pain during or after sexual intercourse.</li><li>Period-related or cyclical gastrointestinal symptoms, in particular painful bowel movements.</li><li>Period-related or cyclical urinary symptoms, in particular blood in the urine or pain passing urine.</li><li>Infertility in association with 1 or more of the above.</li></ul></li><li>If endometriosis is suspected, a thorough history and examination should be done to:<ul><li>Identify risk factors (such as early menarche, nulliparity, or family history of endometriosis).</li><li>Exclude differential diagnoses (such as irritable bowel syndrome or pelvic inflammatory disease).</li><li>Identify complications (such as fertility problems or depression).</li></ul></li><li>The possibility of endometriosis should not be excluded if the abdominal or pelvic examination is normal. If clinical suspicion remains or symptoms persist, referral for further assessment and investigation should be considered.</li><li>Diagnosis of endometriosis can only be made definitively by laparoscopic visualization of the pelvis. However, other less invasive methods (including ultrasound) may be useful in assisting diagnosis.</li><li>Management of women with suspected or confirmed endometriosis involves:<ul><li>Managing endometriosis-related pain with simple analgesics (paracetamol and/or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) and/or hormonal treatment (combined oral contraceptive pill or a progestogen), as appropriate.</li><li>Assessing the woman's individual information and support needs, taking into account her circumstances, symptoms, priorities, desire for fertility, aspects of daily living, work and study, cultural background as well as her physical, psychosexual, and emotional needs. </li><li>Assessing for, and managing, complications of endometriosis, such as fertility problems or depression. </li><li>Reviewing the woman.</li></ul></li><li>Referral to secondary care should be arranged:<ul><li>For women with severe, persistent, or recurrent symptoms.</li><li>For women with pelvic signs of endometriosis.</li><li>If the initial management is not effective, not tolerated, or contraindicated (for consideration of other management options, including laparoscopy). </li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 19f93a8d-0498-4cff-b447-11b541d02cb0 --><!-- end item d2ce4763-9c7c-428c-b1c7-12b2c3266be0 -->","topic":{"id":"3eef2de4-2956-51b1-a059-4cbd4139a25b","topicId":"b292df1a-ddc5-4a1d-9b90-185ea19b4e70","topicName":"Endometriosis","slug":"endometriosis","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"395e6ee5-6371-5176-836b-781aff9c04d6","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"b283df94-e1ac-5c31-8754-e01a285248de","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"6975b1f3-b77b-52cf-8b4d-5c6b3fc69c98","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"9493bc31-622c-53a5-8b99-0bb65dfcfbdf","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"d7bf8cc4-e8cc-5257-b824-cb3ddacabce7","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"f446ba22-a9c2-56c4-878c-b0b0bdac1aff","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"a00e7a73-6f58-5c74-bd34-16e7e1cc4e24","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"1ab4c596-bae4-587c-924f-0eef167e7c05","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"206d9666-9c0e-5d1e-8396-df764b62eed0","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"ac09dd77-b858-58e3-b26f-fa304d1cf972","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"fbdbef3c-8dff-5a5a-9053-b45b6d8131c2","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
