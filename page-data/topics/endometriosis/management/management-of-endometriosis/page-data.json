recommendations for the treatment of endometriosis </strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/endometriosis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>]<strong>:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Surgical management</strong><ul><li>Women with suspected or confirmed endometriosis should be asked about their symptoms, preferences, and priorities with respect to pain and fertility, to guide surgical decision-making. </li><li>Surgical treatment for endometriosis should be performed laparoscopically unless there are contraindications.</li><li>During a laparoscopy to diagnose endometriosis, laparoscopic treatment of the following, if present, should be considered:<ul><li>Peritoneal endometriosis not involving the bowel, bladder, or ureter.</li><li>Uncomplicated ovarian endometriomas.</li></ul></li><li>As an adjunct to surgery for deep endometriosis involving the bowel, bladder, or ureter, 3 months of treatment with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists should be considered before surgery.</li><li>Excision rather than ablation should be considered to treat endometriomas, taking into account the woman's desire for fertility and her ovarian reserve.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Combination treatments</strong><ul><li>After laparoscopic excision or ablation of endometriosis, hormonal treatment (with, for example, the combined oral contraceptive pill) should be considered, to prolong the benefits of surgery and manage symptoms.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Hysterectomy in combination with surgical management </strong><ul><li>If hysterectomy is indicated (for example if the woman has adenomyosis or heavy menstrual bleeding that has not responded to other treatments), all visible endometriotic lesions should be excised at the time of the hysterectomy.</li><li>Hysterectomy should be performed (with or without oophorectomy) laparoscopically when combined with surgical treatment of endometriosis, unless there are contraindications.</li><li>For women thinking about having a hysterectomy, the following should be discussed: what a hysterectomy involves and when it may be needed; the possible benefits and risks of hysterectomy; the possible benefits and risks of having oophorectomy at the same time; how a hysterectomy (with or without oophorectomy) could affect endometriosis symptoms; that hysterectomy should be combined with excision of all visible endometriotic lesions; endometriosis recurrence and the possible need for further surgery; and the possible benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy after hysterectomy with oophorectomy.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Surgical management if fertility is a priority </strong><ul><li>NICE states that these recommendations should be interpreted within the context of the NICE guideline <a data-hyperlink-id=\"3ad0dbe8-4bd6-4236-bf23-ab6a01638ca2\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg156\">Fertility problems: assessment and treatment</a>. The management of endometriosis-related subfertility should have multidisciplinary team involvement with input from a fertility specialist. This should include the recommended diagnostic fertility tests or preoperative tests, as well as other recommended fertility treatments, such as assisted reproduction, that are included in the NICE guideline on fertility problems.<ul><li>Excision or ablation of endometriosis plus adhesiolysis should be offered for endometriosis not involving the bowel, bladder, or ureter, because this improves the chance of spontaneous pregnancy.</li><li>Laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy with excision of the cyst wall should be offered to women with endometriomas, because this improves the chance of spontaneous pregnancy and reduces recurrence. The woman's ovarian reserve should be taken into account.</li><li>For women who have deep endometriosis involving the bowel, bladder, or ureter and who are trying to conceive (working with a fertility specialist), the benefits and risks of laparoscopic surgery as a treatment option should be discussed. Topics to discuss may include: whether laparoscopic surgery may alter the chance of future pregnancy; the possible impact on ovarian reserve; the possible impact on fertility if complications arise; alternatives to surgery; and other fertility factors.</li><li>Hormonal treatment should not be offered to women with endometriosis who are trying to conceive, because it does not improve spontaneous pregnancy rates.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 7857f362-5531-4f87-8027-ab6a015da0cd --><!-- end item 6809424f-8dc3-4dcd-8569-ab6a015da0aa -->","subChapters":[]},{"id":"3d1045d4-4289-5542-a30a-565f09638c04","slug":"basis-for-recommendation-5e1","fullItemName":"Basis for recommendation","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 1fc08093-94bb-4c4f-b9f6-3eb9832a9777 --><h4>Basis for recommendation</h4><!-- end field 1fc08093-94bb-4c4f-b9f6-3eb9832a9777 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 5e1b480a-ee5b-4e46-b447-d56dff0da791 --><!-- begin field 6813eea8-00d9-452b-8038-b0ed132d130f --><p>These recommendations are largely based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline <em>Endometriosis: diagnosis and management </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/endometriosis/references/\">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/endometriosis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>]. </p><h5>Referral </h5><ul><li>These recommendations are based on the experience and opinion of the NICE Guideline Committee.<ul><li>The Committee discussed the symptoms and signs that may require further monitoring or referral as well as particular conditions that indicate that further monitoring or referral may be required.</li><li>It was agreed that referral should be considered based on the severity, persistence, and recurrence of symptoms. If a clinical examination indicates pelvic signs of endometriosis, this should also lead to referral.</li><li>Women with signs suggestive of deep endometriosis involving bowel, bladder, or ureter would require further investigations, surgery, or both and would need to be referred to specialist services. The Committee did not want to be too prescriptive about what these signs suggestive of deep endometriosis involving bowel, bladder, or ureter were because these could vary on a case by case basis. It was agreed that specific cases requiring referral to a specialist endometriosis service could be difficult to define and that there is always room for clinical judgment in decisions about referral. </li><li>For young women (aged 17 years or younger) suspected of having endometriosis, referral to a paediatric and adolescent gynaecology service was more appropriate.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Managing endometriosis-related pain</h5><ul><li><strong>Analgesia</strong><ul><li>NICE based this recommendation on consensus and the experience and expertise of the Guideline Committee due to the poor quality and limited evidence available. <ul><li>Despite a lack of evidence, the Committee concluded that a short trial (for example 3 months) of paracetamol or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) alone or in combination is appropriate for the first-line management of endometriosis-related pain.</li><li>The Committee discussed whether the addition of an opioid analgesic could be considered if pain was not adequately controlled after a trial period of these medications. However, given the chronic nature of endometriosis-related pain and the likelihood of adverse effects, such as constipation, the Committee concluded that a referral for diagnosis might be more appropriate and that there were other treatment options available.</li><li>The Committee considered whether any different recommendations were necessary for adolescent women but concluded that none were required.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Hormone treatment</strong><ul><li>Endometriosis is thought to be a predominantly oestrogen-dependent condition, and ovarian suppression with hormones is offered as an alternative treatment to surgery. </li><li>Many of the hormones used to manage endometriosis-associated pain will also reduce menstrual bleeding, which may be advantageous in some women. The contraceptive properties of hormones may be desirable if the woman does not wish to become pregnant, or unwanted if fertility is an issue. All these factors should be taken into consideration, and discussed with the woman, when deciding on the use of hormones for the treatment of endometriosis.</li><li>The Committee suggested that a particular point to highlight in such a discussion is that although there can be a delay in return to fertility after stopping treatment with hormones (which might be a particular consideration for perimenopausal women), spontaneous pregnancy rates are not affected.</li><li>NICE recommends that the first-line hormonal treatment would generally be the combined oral contraceptive (COC) pill or progestogens as they have good efficacy and typically have adverse effects that women may find more tolerable.<ul><li>Evidence identified by NICE showed that cyclic use of the combined oral contraceptive pill is effective, but the Guideline Committee were also aware that continuous and tricycling (where three packets are taken in a row, followed by a pill free interval) use of the pill are used in clinical practice. Although there is currently no evidence on these regimens, the Committee have found in their experience that these were also effective with limited adverse effects.</li><li>The Committee recommends that if first-line hormonal treatment is contraindicated or not tolerated, the woman should be referred to a gynaecologist for possible further treatment, for example gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues or surgery.</li><li>Throughout the process, the Committee stressed the importance of the woman’s choice and of fully informing them about their options.</li></ul></li><li>CKS identified a systematic review that examined the evidence for the efficacy of the use of hormonal contraception to improve disease-related pain and decrease postoperative risk of disease recurrence in women with endometriosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/endometriosis/references/\">Grandi, 2019</a>]. The evidence showed that combined hormonal contraceptives and progestogens are effective for the relief of endometriosis-related dysmenorrhoea, pelvic pain, and dyspareunia, and improve quality of life. Some COCs decreased the risk of disease recurrence after conservative surgery, but progestogens did not. There was insufficient evidence to reach definitive conclusions about the overall superiority of any particular hormonal contraceptive.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Neuropathic drugs</strong><ul><li>NICE found insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of neuromodulators in managing pain of women with endometriosis. The Guideline Committee agreed that the recommendations in NICE guideline <em>Neuropathic pain in adults: pharmacological management in non-specialist settings</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/endometriosis/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>] would be generalizable to women with endometriosis and therefore cross-referenced to this guidance.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Information and support</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to assess for, and manage, complications of endometriosis, such as infertility and depression, are based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li><li>Accurate, evidence-based, up-to-date, and easily accessible information on endometriosis, especially general information on symptoms and management, is crucial to support women with endometriosis to understand and self-manage the condition. NICE recognizes that the challenge for healthcare professionals is to tailor information to the individual needs, preferences, and circumstances of each woman while also allowing for flexibility because information needs may also change with time or if new symptoms develop [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/endometriosis/references/\">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2017</a>].<ul><li>The NICE Guideline Committee reviewed the information and support needs for women with endometriosis and their families, and the barriers and facilitators in the provision of these information and support needs.

The Committee agreed that these women should be considered for further monitoring because their symptoms would, most likely, persist and there may also be disease progression.</li></ul><!-- end field 6813eea8-00d9-452b-8038-b0ed132d130f --><!-- end item 5e1b480a-ee5b-4e46-b447-d56dff0da791 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
