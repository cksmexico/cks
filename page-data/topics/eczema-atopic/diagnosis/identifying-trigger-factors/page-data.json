For example:<ul><li>Synthetic fabrics and wool tend to itch and irritate the skin.</li><li>Silk fabric is often closely woven, thereby impeding the flow of air, and some people are allergic to the sericin protein in silk.</li><li>Cotton fabric is usually recommended; however, its structure contains short fibres which expand and contract, causing a rubbing movement that can irritate delicate skin. The dyes used in coloured cotton garments can increase the risk of a sensitivity reaction.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Skin infections</strong> — Sta<em>phylococcus aureus</em> is implicated as both a causal factor and a trigger factor for atopic eczema. Other organisms implicated include streptococcus species, Candida albicans, <em>Pityrosporum</em> yeasts, and herpes simplex.</li><li><strong>Contact allergens</strong> — ask about preservatives in topical medications, perfume-based products, metals, and latex.<ul><li>Consider the possibility of allergic contact dermatitis in people with an exacerbation of previously controlled atopic eczema, or with reactions to topical treatments. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/dermatitis-contact/\">Dermatitis - contact</a>. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Inhalant allergens</strong> — ask about symptoms around pets and pollen, especially in older children and adults with seasonal flares, asthma, or rhinitis, and in children over 3 years of age with atopic eczema on the face, especially around the eyes.</li><li><strong>Hormonal triggers</strong> — be aware that changes in hormone levels can affect the symptoms of atopic eczema in some women, for example premenstrual flares of eczema can occur, and pregnancy can adversely affect eczema in some women.</li><li><strong>Climate</strong> — extremes of temperatures can affect atopic eczema. There is a seasonal variation in the pattern of atopic eczema, and most people are aware of improvements in their eczema during the summer (with worsening symptoms in the winter). Sweating induced by heat or exercise can provoke a flare of eczema at any time of year.</li><li><strong>Concurrent illness and disruption to family life</strong> — teething, emotional stress, ill health, and lack of sleep can affect the symptoms of atopic eczema.</li><li><strong>Dietary factors</strong> — ask about itch or redness after certain foods (immediately or hours later), diarrhoea, vomiting, and/or poor weight gain. Milk, egg, wheat, soy, and peanut account for about 75% of the cases of food-induced atopic eczema. <ul><li>Consider asking the person to keep a food diary over 4–6 weeks. In infants, also ask about feeding history (weaning, breastfeeding, or bottle feeding).</li><li>Suspect food allergy in children with atopic eczema who have reacted previously to a food, with immediate symptoms, or in infants and young children with moderate or severe atopic eczema that has not been controlled by optimum management, particularly if associated with gut dysmotility (colic, vomiting, altered bowel habit) or failure to thrive.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Most people do not need allergy testing. </strong><ul><li>Advise avoidance of over-the-counter tests as these are of no proven value.</li><li><strong>If a food allergy is suspected,</strong> manage in primary care if the expertise and support are available, otherwise refer to secondary care.</li><li><strong>If other types of allergies are suspected,</strong> refer to secondary care as appropriate.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 5c40c18b-7c75-4a43-9d03-a72800ba8ac0 --><!-- end item 18b19efd-1cca-4b2f-bc0e-a72800ba862c -->","topic":{"id":"63a4e43b-49fe-563e-ac98-e9b0859c592c","topicId":"68307f26-e94a-48b4-9595-fadcb2fdee8a","topicName":"Eczema -
