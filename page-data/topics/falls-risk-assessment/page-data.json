It is distinguished from a collapse caused by an acute medical problem, such as an acute arrhythmia, transient ischaemic attack, or vertigo.</li></ul></li><li>Falls are common in older people, especially those aged 65 years and over, and the prevalence increases with age. </li><li>The risk of falling is multifactorial, and prevention is usually based on assessing multiple risk factors. </li><li>A history of falls is one of the strongest risk factors for a fall, and all older people in regular contact with healthcare professionals should be asked routinely whether they have fallen in the past year.</li><li>Other risk factors for falls in older people include:<ul><li>Conditions that affects mobility or balance, such as arthritis, diabetes, incontinence, stroke, syncope, or Parkinson's disease.</li><li>Other conditions, including muscle weakness, poor balance, visual impairment, cognitive impairment, depression, and alcohol misuse.</li><li>Polypharmacy, or the use of psychoactive drugs (such as benzodiazepines) or drugs that can cause postural hypotension (such as anti-hypertensive drugs).</li><li>Home hazards, such as loose rugs or mats, poor lighting, wet surfaces (especially in the bathroom), and loose fittings (such as handrails).</li></ul></li><li>About 40–60% of falls result in major lacerations, traumatic brain injuries, or fractures. Other complications of falls include<strong> </strong>distress, pain, loss of self-confidence, reduced quality of life, loss of independence, and mortality. </li><li>Older people who present for medical attention because of a fall, report recurrent falls in the past year, or have other risk factors for falls should be assessed for gait and balance abnormalities (for example by using the Timed Up & Go test and/or the Turn 180° test).</li><li>A multifactorial risk assessment by an appropriately skilled and experienced clinician (usually in a specialist falls service) should be offered to older people who have had one or more falls in the past year or demonstrate abnormalities of gait and/or balance. This assessment should be part of an individualized, multifactorial intervention.<ul><li>A multifactorial risk assessment may include assessing for home hazards, visual impairment, and drug treatments.</li><li>Interventions commonly offered by specialist falls services include strength and balance training, home hazard assessment and intervention, vision assessment and referral, and medication review (with modification or withdrawal).</li></ul></li><li>People who do not have an indication to be referred for a multifactorial risk assessment should be reassessed at least annually.</li></ul><!-- end field 5ca1178e-97b2-4171-a557-5af8243cc761 --><!-- end item 547b5ab4-0e8b-48e2-90c1-b925bc3db239 -->","topic":{"id":"ec87421f-7ea3-508d-ba78-b50bdd43d3be","topicId":"984467a2-6284-4f25-bee5-6b2b114c7a25","topicName":"Falls -
