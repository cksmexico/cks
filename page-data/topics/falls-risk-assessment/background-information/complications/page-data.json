Following a hip fracture, short and long-term outlooks are generally poor, with an increased one-year mortality of between 18–33% and negative effects on daily living activities, such as shopping and walking. A review of long-term disability found that following a hip fracture around 20% of people entered long-term care in the first year after the fracture [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/falls-risk-assessment/references/\">PHE, 2018</a>]. </li><li>The risk of getting a fragility fracture depends on the person's <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/falls-risk-assessment/background-information/risk-factors/\">risk of falls</a>, their bone strength (determined by bone mineral density [BMD]), and the presence of other risk factors, such as age (risk increases with age and is at least partly independent of BMD), use of corticosteroids, and smoking.
