Many factors can influence this, including lifestyle, genetics, medical conditions, and medication.</li><li>Different weight classes are defined according to a person's body mass index (BMI). This is calculated by dividing the person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in metres:<ul><li>Healthy weight — BMI of 18.5–24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup></li><li>Overweight — BMI of 25–29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup></li><li>Obesity l — BMI of 30–34.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup></li><li>Obesity ll — BMI of 35–39.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup></li><li>Obesity lll — BMI of 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> or more</li></ul></li><li>Obesity is a global problem. In the UK, more than 1 in 4 adults is obese, and the prevalence is increasing. </li><li>Obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing a number of chronic diseases and conditions, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke, depression, certain cancers, obstructive sleep apnoea, breathlessness, and psychological distress. It is also associated with decreased life expectancy and has significant effects on demands on the health service and the economy (for example from hospital admissions or time off work).</li><li>Most of the complications of obesity can be reduced by weight loss.</li><li>The subject of weight should be approached carefully because people who are overweight or obese may be sensitive about discussing it, or feel that their presenting problem is being overlooked.</li><li>Clinical judgement should be used to investigate comorbidities and other factors to an appropriate level of detail, depending on the person, the timing of the assessment, and the degree of overweight or obesity. </li><li>Multicomponent interventions are the treatment of choice for people who are overweight or obese.<ul><li>The components of the planned weight management programme should be discussed and agreed with the person, and tailored to their preferences, initial fitness, health status, and lifestyle.</li><li>Weight management programmes should include behaviour change strategies to increase people's physical activity levels or decrease inactivity, improve eating behaviour and the quality of the person's diet, and reduce energy intake.</li><li>Drug treatment should be considered as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions for adults with BMI of 30 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>or more, or BMI of 27 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>or more with associated risk factors (such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidaemia). </li><li>Bariatric surgery is the option of choice for adults with a BMI of more than 50 kg/m<sup>2</sup> when other interventions have not been effective. It is also recommended as a treatment option for some adults with a BMI of 40 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>or more, or between 35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> with other significant disease that could be improved if they lost weight, for example, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, or severe mobility problems.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field cfe4881f-db42-418b-a7ad-6be78f16a0d7 --><!-- end item 3db47cd7-f53b-48f0-aa34-f401594f230e -->","topic":{"id":"c301533a-3c5f-5238-aac1-4bf163fabdf2","topicId":"ce3a3429-b3d0-4c54-8025-abb6e33dff88","topicName":"Obesity","slug":"obesity","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"dd66ad3d-4814-5adc-92fb-39e3b4d8f788","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"0fa3d01a-4842-5ec2-b85f-638b92e3ef14","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"64d9ae78-8203-5176-bef3-411c488b93dc","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"892bc984-b7ae-5830-91da-e570afd541ed","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"322163e5-1cb7-5dc8-b9ca-874d4fdb1a44","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"ef9a094b-abce-5a97-bee5-98c4986de194","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"4772dece-06ea-5147-bc24-b36aae1dd6a3","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"57961a43-ade1-5671-bb4f-44614134ded9","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"91fec363-e9d2-57df-a40e-dbbfce99eb80","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"6f66b98c-4b76-5bad-a30b-597d598b7ff1","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"820d050d-9427-5bcb-b0b5-6f7e333a2056","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
