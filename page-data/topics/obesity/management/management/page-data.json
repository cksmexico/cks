Although low carbohydrate diet was associated with modest but significantly greater improvements in weight loss and predicted ASCVD risk in studies from 8 weeks to 24 months in duration, the authors noted that the long-term effects of a low carbohydrate diet require further investigation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obesity/references/\">Sacker-Bernstein, 2015</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The <em>European Guidelines for Obesity Management in Adults </em>states that a balanced hypocaloric diet results in clinically meaningful weight loss regardless of which macronutrients they emphasise [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obesity/references/\">Yumuk, 2015</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article is that any diet in which caloric intake is less than caloric expenditure will lead to weight loss.
