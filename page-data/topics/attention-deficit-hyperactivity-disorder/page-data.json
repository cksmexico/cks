These core symptoms are age-inappropriate and result in significant psychological, social, and/or educational functional impairment. When assessing a child with possible ADHD it is important to note that:<ul><li>Symptoms typically appear in children 3–7 years of age, but may not be recognized until after 7 years of age, especially if hyperactivity is not present.</li><li>Symptoms should be present for at least 6 months.</li><li>Symptoms should be pervasive in at least two settings, such as home, school, social situations, or work.</li><li>Other causes for symptoms should be excluded, such as general or specific learning difficulties; anxiety; depression; abuse; trauma; or rarely, medical conditions, such as unsuspected hearing problems or epilepsy.</li></ul></li><li>The diagnosis and treatment of ADHD requires referral and assessment by a specialist. However, some children, with symptoms that are causing only a moderate impairment to their ability to function socially and at school, can initially be managed in primary care with self-help, simple behavioural management or parent support programmes.</li><li>Referral may be to a specialist paediatrician, a child psychiatrist, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), or an adult psychiatrist, depending on the age of the person and local service provision.</li><li>The management of people with confirmed ADHD should be initiated and co-ordinated by specialists.</li><li>The treatment options offered by a specialist depend on the person's age and the degree of functional impairment and may include:<ul><li>Parent education/support programmes.</li><li>Group psychological treatment (cognitive behavioural therapy [CBT] and/or social skills training).</li><li>Individual psychological treatment.</li><li>Drug treatment (methylphenidate, atomoxetine, dexamfetamine, or lisdexamfetamine).</li></ul></li><li>People with a diagnosis of ADHD should eat a balanced diet and take regular exercise.<ul><li>Eliminating artificial colourings and additives from the diet is not recommended unless there appears to be a link between certain foods or drinks and a person’s ADHD symptoms.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 63573e85-7775-4bbb-853e-35dfaa7f6ef2 --><!-- end item 62c932e6-a232-4f82-9bf5-db804b579ca4 -->","topic":{"id":"58fdf356-8ba5-546f-8dc0-2f52caf10b0d","topicId":"634d93f6-99ac-40ea-821e-2886075c4f40","topicName":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","slug":"attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"97f99690-0b45-5db9-91f6-a4ccf1441f55","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"3288c19f-08ea-5db5-9fe3-2a19e4e9480e","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"117c3288-2c4b-54a9-93a6-e73cfa827ea6","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"05022ed2-5af8-5139-9aee-325340958ba7","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"280f9139-8e61-5232-b633-87792a692c21","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"7df3faa3-c76c-5513-8300-b8e6c29a6710","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"dd6487fd-840a-583c-9def-1b3fbf119433","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"7d672b8e-e109-5eee-9f6a-937dc8647595","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"6ee4b93a-2830-5f51-9991-1c95ef010724","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"f40bd230-c678-561c-9d40-5bc8424b3e61","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"473473fc-1cf7-5675-876d-9cf4806ca71c","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
