Once tolerance is established, greater exposure of less processed cow's milk should be according to the 'milk ladder'. Children become tolerant to baked milk before fresh milk as baking reduces protein allergenicity, so reintroduction with baked milk should be attempted before fresh milk [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cows-milk-allergy-in-children/references/\">Luyt et al, 2014</a>].</li><li>The BSACI guideline notes, however, that there is little evidence on the effect of processing on the allergenicity of specific foods, and therefore use of the milk ladder may result in a bigger than anticipated step-up in exposure.</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article notes that gradual reintroduction of baked milk products via the milk ladder accelerates the development of tolerance to cow's milk compared with a complete milk exclusion approach [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cows-milk-allergy-in-children/references/\">Venter et al, 2013</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation for parents/carers to have oral antihistamines at home in case there is a recurrence of symptoms is based on the BSACI guideline.</li><li>If symptoms return following a home reintroduction, the recommendation to reassess tolerance at 6–12 monthly intervals from 12 months of age is based on the BSACI guideline. This approach is supported by the ESPGHAN and EAACI guidelines, which note that reassessment for tolerance at regular intervals potentially avoids inappropriate or unnecessarily lengthy dietary eliminations that may impair quality of life and the child's nutrition and growth, as well as incurring additional healthcare costs.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Advising on sources of information and support</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to offer information and support is based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cows-milk-allergy-in-children/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>], the BSACI guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cows-milk-allergy-in-children/references/\">Luyt et al, 2014</a>], the EAACI guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cows-milk-allergy-in-children/references/\">Muraro, 2014</a>], the World Allergy Organization publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cows-milk-allergy-in-children/references/\">Fiocchi et al, 2010</a>], the updated iMAP guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cows-milk-allergy-in-children/references/\">Fox, 2019</a>], and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cows-milk-allergy-in-children/references/\">Ludman et al, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cows-milk-allergy-in-children/references/\">Venter et al, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cows-milk-allergy-in-children/references/\">Martorell-Aragones, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cows-milk-allergy-in-children/references/\">Venter, 2017</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to provide education on allergen avoidance to reduce the risk of accidental milk exposure is based on the BSACI guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cows-milk-allergy-in-children/references/\">Luyt et al, 2014</a>], the EAACI guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cows-milk-allergy-in-children/references/\">Muraro, 2014</a>], and is supported by expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cows-milk-allergy-in-children/references/\">Venter et al, 2013</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field 1885d3d4-ac7e-477d-a729-f8734d8bb0fd --><!-- end item 2302ceea-352f-4704-b9cb-310cae36e72f -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
