A literature search was conducted in October 2019 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key randomized controlled trials published since the last revision of the topic. The topic name has been changed from <em>Cows' milk protein allergy in children</em> to <em>Cow's milk allergy in children</em> in line with current literature. Relevant NICE quality standards on food allergy have been added to the topic. The topic has undergone minor restructuring. The recommendations on the assessment and management of suspected cow's milk allergy have been amended in line with current evidence. The Scenario on Confirmed cows' milk protein allergy has been renamed Confirmed non-IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy, with a focus on the management of non-IgE-mediated cow's milk allergy in primary care. A new Prescribing information section has been added to provide information on prescribing oral antihistamines, in line with the CKS topic on Food allergy.</p><!-- end field f010f15b-ada2-48ff-bb6b-5c31d9426e4f --><!-- end item 6854fca3-bf8d-4b69-a7b7-432e9cc0e2ed -->","topic":{"id":"a5282e12-9e0e-5a93-bf1e-c47cb44993b6","topicId":"055e8853-0668-4ee8-bef5-d86e8a39b416","topicName":"Cow's milk allergy in children","slug":"cows-milk-allergy-in-children","lastRevised":"Last revised in December 2019","chapters":[{"id":"e95ad3f8-8ddd-57bd-8fe1-a01a59402ca1","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"fceefe8b-f1a1-54cb-add7-5660134a61f9","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"ff117841-0d0c-5d1f-ad22-a2d8db741006","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"0a17cde7-a3cc-580f-a5ec-e74a03694b87","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"e8251ee6-b8da-567a-b543-5efa4c24f074","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"5cd1ea49-3964-5480-beb5-1208ab83ecb4","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"6737a350-b49d-5d33-a999-d2a5f41c7f48","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"bb1f8ca2-c855-56ee-bc57-4b1b77c9a276","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"296bbdac-c210-5305-8b31-aabc917df09f","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"5c4984e6-3f82-5632-9d43-2766ecbdec62","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"52bb5ec1-cd13-5a6e-a889-5e1d7a9ffcf6","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
