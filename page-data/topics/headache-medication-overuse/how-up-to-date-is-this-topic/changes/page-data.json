A literature search was conducted in October 2012 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key RCTs published since the last revision of this topic. Information from the guideline: <em>Headache</em><em>. Diagnosis and management of </em><em>headache</em><em> in young people and adults</em> commissioned by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), has been added. Minor changes have been made to the recommendations.</p><p><strong>January 2012</strong> — minor update. McNeil Products Ltd, in collaboration with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), has published new safety data regarding the association of domperidone with an increased risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. This topic has been updated to reflect their advice on dosing, adverse effects, and drug interactions.</p><p><strong>March to August 2009</strong> — converted from CKS guidance to CKS topic structure. The evidence-base has been reviewed in detail, and recommendations are more clearly justified and transparently linked to the supporting evidence. Together with the CKS topics on Headache - assessment, Headache - cluster, and Headache - tension-type, this CKS topic replaces the former topic on Headache. CKS no longer recommends replacing the over-used medication with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or amitriptyline until the medication overuse headache improves. It is now recommended that, for suitable people, abrupt withdrawal without drug replacement is tried first.</p><p><strong>September 2008</strong> — minor correction to the Changes section.</p><p><strong>October 2005</strong> — minor technical update.</p><p><strong>July 2005</strong> — update to text discussing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the Medicines management and Prescribing points sections.</p><p><strong>January 2005</strong> — rewritten.
