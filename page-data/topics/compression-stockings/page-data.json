The person should be referred for specialist vascular assessment.</li><li>ABPI 0.8–1.3 — compression stockings are safe to wear.</li><li>ABPI greater than 1.3 — compression should be avoided, as high ABPI values may be due to calcified and incompressible arteries. The person should be referred for specialist vascular assessment.</li></ul></li><li>The condition of the skin should be checked — fragile skin may be damaged while putting on or removing compression stockings. Ideally, venous ulcers should be healed before using compression stockings.</li><li>The person should be assessed to ensure they can manage compression stockings — conditions such as arthritis may make it difficult for the person to put on or remove stockings.</li><li>The degree of compression (class of stocking) used should depend on the condition being treated. It should be the highest the person can tolerate.<ul><li>Varicose veins — class 1 or 2 stockings, depending on the severity.</li><li>Venous eczema, lipodermatosclerosis, atrophie blanche, healed venous leg ulcers — class 2 stockings, or class 3 stockings if inadequate response to class 2 stockings, or class 1 if class 2 is not tolerated.</li><li>Superficial thrombophlebitis — class 2 stockings, however most people find class 2 stockings too painful. Class 1 stockings or travel socks are practical alternatives.</li></ul></li><li>Below-knee compression stockings are usually preferred. Thigh-length stockings should be considered if there are severe varicose veins above the knee or swelling which extends above the knee.</li><li>Open toe stockings may be necessary if the person:<ul><li>Has arthritic or clawed toes, or fungal infection.</li><li>Prefers to wear a sock over the compression stocking.</li><li>Has a long foot size compared with their calf size.</li></ul></li><li>Compression stockings should be removed at bedtime, but if this is not possible they can be worn continuously for up to a maximum of 7 days.</li><li>Compression stockings should be replaced every 3–6 months — ideally, each time a stocking is replaced, the leg should be re-measured.</li></ul><!-- end field ffe37b99-6a05-4490-8e70-1288fa25c2cf --><!-- end item 96d7cf15-2f30-463c-9362-8e32ea255bad -->","topic":{"id":"6a31699b-4df2-5fb2-8158-3a0e92a8e7eb","topicId":"eb2600a9-8943-4252-938e-032dfe5933f8","topicName":"Compression stockings","slug":"compression-stockings","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"73f1a203-62e9-5aaf-b61e-ce7ebc201ae9","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"62893c7c-d825-559e-8358-b33ac4901ace","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"37f8eb6d-20ce-5efc-94ce-4c275d3ff85f","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"ec6ed577-cc8f-51fd-ba58-0f919d0e34e9","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"02f5dd79-4069-5407-9f12-9ace79f0d8ae","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"1cc5a10b-49b4-5a51-a2c4-39e69eb25fff","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"7c4737af-948e-5161-a85f-61b9dc1d690d","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"7266bc91-abea-547a-b2a5-33d5bfcb2ba0","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"fe2bb32a-ce7c-5fea-aa2a-0f6ad7a6caed","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"f06c1cdf-db2a-522a-8567-6906fc119556","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"4cd1b343-2088-5fb9-979b-7d3b8ae5d1d8","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
