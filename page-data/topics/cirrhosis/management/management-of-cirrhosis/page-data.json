For example, analgesics should be carefully chosen, taking into account the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hepatic encephalopathy with opiates, and the effects of paracetamol on the liver [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Ge and Runyon, 2016</a>]. This is supported by a review article, in which experts advise prescribers to consider drug interactions and the possible need for lower doses when a person has cirrhosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Tsochatzis et al, 2014</a>].</li></ul><h5>Ensuring follow-up and monitoring</h5><ul><li>CKS advises treatment where possible for the underlying liver condition in line with expert opinion that this may influence disease progression [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Tsochatzis et al, 2014</a>]. A review article on the identification and monitoring of cirrhosis recognises that secondary care is responsible for screening and surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma and varices, but advocates that GPs should confirm arrangements are in place for the person with cirrhosis to receive appropriate investigations [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Keane et al, 2016</a>]. This is supported in principle by expert opinion that the management of patients with cirrhosis should aim for a multidisciplinary, unified approach between primary and secondary care [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Muir, 2015</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Awareness of potential complications</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on expert opinion in a review article which discusses the important role primary healthcare practitioners play in the early recognition of potential diagnoses and collaborating with specialists to manage and prevent complications arising as a result of cirrhosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Muir, 2015</a>]. <strong> </strong></li><li>A European consensus statement noted that, in contrast to the emergency presentation to a specialist which often occurs with decompensation events such as variceal bleeding or ascites, people with hepatic encephalopathy may present to their primary care practitioner with cognitive dysfunction and there should be a low threshold for suspecting the potential diagnosis, and timely assessment and referral to facilitate early management [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Shawcross et al, 2016</a>].  </li></ul><!-- end field ce29e68b-b90c-4b2a-8593-a8c600b323cf --><!-- end item 965b06fe-c9d5-4b25-bab4-a8c600b323cf -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
