cirrhosis</h4><ul><li>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) accepts that a confirmatory test for cirrhosis is required because the condition is not always obvious clinically as people with compensated disease may not report symptoms or display signs [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">National Guideline Centre, 2016</a>].  </li></ul><h4>Discussing the accuracy, limitations, and risks of the different tests for diagnosing cirrhosis</h4><ul><li>This recommendation reflects the NICE guideline <em>Cirrhosis in over 16s: assessment and management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>] and enables the person to make informed choices and facilitates shared decision making.</li></ul><h4>Not using routine laboratory tests to rule out cirrhosis</h4><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the NICE guideline <em>Cirrhosis in over 16s: assessment and management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>]<strong> </strong>and is supported by a Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) document on the practical implications of the NICE guideline in primary care [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">RCGP, 2017</a>]. The NICE guideline development group (GDG) noted that cirrhosis is not excluded by normal liver function tests (LFTs) such as bilirubin, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">National Guideline Centre, 2016</a>]. Expert opinion in a review article noted the frequency of abnormal LFTs in primary care, but emphasised the poor relationship between these and the presence of cirrhosis, for example, less than 1 in 20 people with asymptomatic cirrhosis will have a raised ALT [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Keane et al, 2016</a>]. </li><li>Some combinations of blood tests are in use as predictors of cirrhosis, for example AST/ALT ratio, AST/platelet ratio, and test panels using blood tests as surrogate markers of fibrogenesis such as FibroTest and Enhanced Liver Fibrosis panel (ELF) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">National Guideline Centre, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Newsome, 2018</a>].  </li></ul><h4>Offering transient elastography to diagnose cirrhosis </h4><ul><li>Transient elastography is a quick, non-invasive, painless test to measure liver stiffness using an ultrasound probe and measuring the velocity of a sound wave passing through the liver, which gives an indication of liver 'stiffness' and therefore the degree of fibrotic change. Results are available immediately and it is able to assess a larger area of the liver than biopsy, although the sensitivity of the test is affected by obesity and the presence of ascites or active hepatitis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">EASL, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Keane et al, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">RCGP, 2017</a>].   </li><li>The groups for whom transient elastography is recommended reflect recommendations in the NICE guideline on <em>Cirrhosis in over 16s: assessment and management </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>]. The NICE GDG identified enough evidence to support the use of transient elastography in these groups and found it to be a cost-effective option, irrespective of underlying cause [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">National Guideline Centre, 2016</a>].  </li></ul><h4>Referral if transient elastography is not available or expertise is lacking in primary care, or it is not suitable</h4><ul><li>CKS acknowledges that access to transient elastography may vary depending on locality, as outlined in a RCGP document on the practical implications of the NICE guideline in primary care [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">RCGP, 2017</a>]. CKS has therefore made the pragmatic recommendation to refer to a hepatologist or gastroenterologist if cirrhosis is suspected but primary care transient elastography is not available in the area.<strong> </strong></li><li>Referral is also necessary if the appropriate training and expertise in interpretation of transient elastography results is not available in a primary care setting as NICE recommends that 'healthcare professions who perform or interpret non-invasive tests are trained to do so' [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>] and EASL-ALEH clinical practice guidelines advise interpretation of transient elastography results should be done by an 'expert clinician' [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">EASL, 2015</a>].</li><li>The NICE guideline <em>Cirrhosis in over 16s: assessment and management</em> recommends considering liver biopsy when transient elastography is not suitable [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>].<strong> </strong>The NICE GDG noted some circumstances when transient elastography cannot be successfully used, such as when a person with hepatitis C makes an informed decision to opt for liver biopsy instead of transient elastography [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">National Guideline Centre, 2016</a>]. Although considering liver biopsy is not included in NICE's cirrhosis primary care pathway [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">National Guideline Centre, 2016</a>], CKS has recommended referral as this procedure is not available in primary care. <ul><li>Although liver biopsy is the 'gold standard' for confirming a diagnosis of cirrhosis, compared with transient elastography, it has a number of drawbacks including expense, risk of complications such as bleeding, and restriction to secondary care. There is also the risk of sampling error, and liver biopsy may give a false negative result in around 15% of cases. Taking this into consideration, it may be preferable to use a more simple, non-invasive test, especially if it is possible in a primary care setting [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">National Guideline Centre, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Offering transient elastography or acoustic radiation force impulse imaging to diagnose cirrhosis in people with NAFLD and advanced liver fibrosis.</h4><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the NICE guideline <em>Cirrhosis in over 16s: assessment and management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>]. <strong> </strong><ul><li>The basis for assessing the risk of advanced liver fibrosis in a person with NAFLD in primary care can be found in the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/\">Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)</a>. </li></ul></li></ul><h4>Refer to the person's specialist for diagnosis of cirrhosis if they have hepatitis B</h4><ul><li>In the guideline <em>Hepatitis B (chronic): diagnosis and management,</em><em> </em>NICE recommends all adults who are HBsAg positive should be referred to a hepatologist or gastroenterologist or infectious disease specialist with an interest in hepatology. Recommendations on diagnosing cirrhosis in people with hepatitis B virus infection are described in the assessment of liver disease in secondary specialist care section of this guideline and choice of diagnostic tests, such as liver biopsy, depend on a number of factors including age, HBV DNA testing and the results of liver function tests [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">NICE, 2013</a>].  </li><li>CKS, therefore, is of the opinion that it is reasonable to refer to the person's specialist for confirmation of a diagnosis of cirrhosis if they have hepatitis B as this is beyond the scope of primary care.</li></ul><h4>Testing for cirrhosis in people who are obese or have type 2 diabetes</h4><ul><li>This recommendation reflects the<strong> </strong>NICE guideline <em>Cirrhosis in over 16s: assessment and management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>]. People with obesity or type 2 diabetes are at risk of cirrhosis if they have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition they are more likely to develop than the general population. If they do not have NAFLD, obesity or type 2 diabetes alone do not increase the risk of cirrhosis, therefore testing for cirrhosis is not necessary [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">National Guideline Centre, 2016</a>]. </li></ul><h4>Referral for further assessment of people with other liver disorders</h4><ul><li>Although much less common than alcohol misuse, hepatitis, and NAFLD, there are a number of other liver conditions that can cause cirrhosis (for example autoimmune liver diseases, genetic conditions) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Keane et al, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">National Guideline Centre, 2016</a>]. NICE does not give advice on the primary care diagnosis of cirrhosis in these groups and as people with these conditions may already be under the care of a specialist, CKS recommends referral for assessment for cirrhosis based on what it considers to be good clinical practice and the expert opinion of reviewers of this topic.</li></ul><h4>Monitoring high-risk people who have normal transient elastography tests</h4><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the NICE guideline<strong> </strong><em>Cirrhosis in over 16s: assessment and management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>]<strong> </strong>and is reinforced by the RCGP discussion on the implementation of this guideline in primary care [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">RCGP, 2017</a>]. <strong> </strong></li></ul><!-- end field 6e4013a5-7ab8-4fb1-8637-a8d200b39fc7 --><!-- end item bbb34766-52b1-49d7-a518-a8d200b39e0e -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
