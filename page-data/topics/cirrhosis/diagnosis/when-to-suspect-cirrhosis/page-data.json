Some people may present with the less specific features of liver disease, for example, fatigue, itch, or loss of appetite [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Williams et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">National Guideline Centre, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Flamm, 2017</a>]. <ul><li>A UK study found that for people in primary care with abnormal liver function tests, the opportunity to investigate or refer to make a diagnosis was sometimes missed. Of 873 people, 18% were not followed up appropriately, and 11% had abnormal test results that would have likely benefited from hospital follow up [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Sherwood et al, 2001</a>].</li></ul></li><li>Suspecting cirrhosis is important because the condition may not be recognised in the asymptomatic group until the liver starts to fail [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">National Guideline Centre, 2016</a>]. By the time symptoms occur it may be harder or even too late to reverse the disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Flamm, 2017</a>]. Earlier diagnosis of liver disease and cirrhosis increases chances to offer treatment and prevent complications and progression to end-stage liver disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">National Guideline Centre, 2016</a>]. In providing first-contact care, primary healthcare professionals are well-placed to identify people at risk of, or with symptoms of, chronic liver disease and should be observant for the less obvious signs or symptoms to enable an earlier diagnosis to be made and prevent complications [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Flamm, 2017</a>]. Expert opinion in a consensus statement and a review article emphasises the key role of primary healthcare practitioners in identifying people with risk factors for, or symptoms of liver disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Muir, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Shawcross et al, 2016</a>].  </li></ul><h4>Suspecting cirrhosis in high-risk groups</h4><ul><li>This recommendation is based on expert opinion in a review article which discusses the identification of cirrhosis by the targeted screening of high-risk groups [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Keane et al, 2016</a>]. The specific risk factors mentioned are in line with the NICE guidance on <em>Cirrhosis in the over 16s: assessment and management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>] and a review of epidemiological data [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Blachier, 2013</a>].  </li><li>The NICE guideline development group noted the lack of a validated risk tool to predict a person's risk of cirrhosis occurring. It was thought that creating such a tool to identify groups requiring further investigation would potentially reduce the chances of progression to end-stage liver disease and avoid complications and the subsequent impact on NHS resources [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">National Guideline Centre, 2016</a>]. <strong> </strong></li></ul><h4>Suspecting cirrhosis based on examination findings</h4><ul><li>The non-specific symptoms listed reflect expert opinion from the British Liver Trust and Royal College of General Practitioners [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">British Liver Trust and RCGP, 2017</a>] and CKS has pragmatically suggested these are particularly relevant in people with risk factors based on the increased likelihood of cirrhosis in this group. Other findings that may indicate cirrhosis are based on expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Starr and Raines, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Udell et al, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Tsochatzis et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Ellul et al, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Muir, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">British Liver Trust and RCGP, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Flamm, 2017</a>]. </li><li>A literature review to identify clinical indicators to exclude or detect cirrhosis in adults with known or suspected liver disease found that ascites on physical examination increased the likelihood of cirrhosis (likelihood ratio [LR] 7.2, 95% CI 2.9–12), whereas absence of hepatomegaly or a firm liver on examination decreased the likelihood (LR 0.37, 95% CI 0.24–0.51) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Udell et al, 2012</a>].  <strong> </strong></li></ul><h4>Suspecting cirrhosis based on blood test results</h4><ul><li>It is important to bear in mind that liver function tests do not rule out cirrhosis, as they can be surprisingly normal, even in advanced disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Starr and Raines, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Udell et al, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">RCGP, 2017</a>]. </li><li>This recommendation is based on a UK consensus <em>Guideline on the management of abnormal liver blood tests, </em>which states that bilirubin, albumin and INR give information about liver function, and platelet count can be indicative of the level of fibrosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Newsome, 2018</a>]. CKS has also taken into account expert opinion in review articles and expert opinion from reviewers of this CKS topic.<ul><li>Expert opinion in a review article lists<strong> </strong>elevated AST/ALT ratio as a subtle sign of cirrhosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Flamm, 2017</a>].</li><li>The liver is less able to metabolise bilirubin as hepatocyte damage occurs, leading to higher serum levels. Synthesis of proteins (including clotting factors) and transaminases is also adversely affected as hepatocytes are lost. Thrombocytopenia may occur as a result of sequestration in the spleen due to portal hypertension [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Starr and Raines, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Muir, 2015</a>]. </li><li>Unsuspected cirrhosis is found in 10–17% of people with unexplained aminotransferase elevation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cirrhosis/references/\">Udell et al, 2012</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 1306ae19-389d-4941-b5f7-a8c600996383 --><!-- end item 8366b4bb-4922-43d5-a7ab-a8c600996383 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
