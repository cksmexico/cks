Pharmacological management in non-specialist settings</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-herpetic-neuralgia/references/\">NICE, 2013</a>] and <em>Guidelines for general practitioners on treatment of pain in post-herpetic neuralgia</em>, published by the Shingles Support Society [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-herpetic-neuralgia/references/\">Panickar and Serpell, 2015</a>].</p><h5>Self-management advice</h5><ul><li>These recommendations are largely based on expert opinion in guidelines from the British Society for the Study of Infection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-herpetic-neuralgia/references/\">BSSI, 1995</a>] and review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-herpetic-neuralgia/references/\">Schmader, 2007</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-herpetic-neuralgia/references/\">Opstelten et al, 2008</a>]. The recommendation to offer patient information leaflets is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good medical practice.</li></ul><h5>Assessing for the presence of depression</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to assess people with post-herpetic neuralgia for signs of depression is based on expert opinion that post-herpetic neuralgia is associated with an increased risk of depression [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-herpetic-neuralgia/references/\">Paisley and Serpell, 2015</a>].</li></ul><h5>Use of paracetamol with or without codeine</h5><ul><li>The advice to offer paracetamol with or without codeine is based on expert opinion that this may be effective in the treatment of mild to moderate post-herpetic neuralgia, and that there is no evidence of benefit from NSAIDs [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-herpetic-neuralgia/references/\">Paisley and Serpell, 2015</a>].</li></ul><h5>Use of lidocaine plasters</h5><ul><li>The advice to offer lidocaine plasters either as sole or adjunctive therapy depending on the person's age, risk of side effects from oral therapies, and level of pain is based on expert opinion in narrative review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-herpetic-neuralgia/references/\">Bruckenthal and Barkin, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-herpetic-neuralgia/references/\">Johnson and Rice, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-herpetic-neuralgia/references/\">Dynamed Plus, 2015</a>].</li></ul><h5>Keeping a pain diary</h5><ul><li>The advice relating to keeping a pain diary is based on feedback from an expert reviewer of the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/trigeminal-neuralgia/\">Trigeminal neuralgia</a>. It was suggested that keeping a pain diary may help people to feel in control, to understand how their pain responds to medication, and when they may be experiencing a remission or relapse. CKS has extrapolated this information to also apply to the management of post-herpetic neuralgia.</li></ul><h5>Early follow-up</h5><ul><li>In the expert opinion of the NICE guideline development group, an early clinical review is important to assess the progress made with titration as well as the effectiveness and tolerability of treatment. This allows any necessary treatment adjustments to be made promptly in order to ensure optimal pain control [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-herpetic-neuralgia/references/\">NICE, 2013</a>].</li><li>CKS recommends using clinical judgement to decide how soon to follow-up a person with neuropathic pain. This pragmatic advice is based on the fact that the urgency of a follow-up will depend on several factors including the cause of neuropathic pain, severity of pain, and the complexity of the titration process.</li></ul><h5>Referral for cognitive behavioural therapy</h5><ul><li>NICE recommends that at psychological therapies may be useful in the management of neuropathic pain [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-herpetic-neuralgia/references/\">NICE, 2013</a>].
