Symptoms associated with the hormone-free interval (HFI) can be problematic and ovarian activity during a 7-day HFI could risk escape ovulation (particularly with lower doses of EE and if use is not perfect). Tailored CHC regimens can be safely used to avoid withdrawal bleeds and associated symptoms and theoretically reduce the risk of contraceptive failure [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/contraception-combined-hormonal-methods/references/\">FSRH, 2019</a>]. </p></li></ul><p><strong>Safety of tailored regimens </strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/contraception-combined-hormonal-methods/references/\">FSRH, 2019</a>]</p><ul><li>Direct data comparing risk of cardiovascular events and cancer between extended and standard CHC regimens are lacking, however, the FSRH states that indirect evidence regarding cardiovascular risk is reassuring.<ul><li>In a Phase 3 trial of 20 micrograms ethinylestradiol/drospirenone (EE/DRSP) combined oral contraceptive (COC), 1067 women were randomised to standard cyclical, flexible extended or fixed extended pill-taking regimens for 1 year. A total of 755 women then entered an extension phase, taking the flexible extended regimen. Metabolic and haemostatic parameters, serum hormone levels and blood pressure were similar in all groups. Numbers of serious adverse events were very low in all groups.</li><li>A smaller trial which randomised 78 women to use extended or standard cyclical regimens of 30 micrograms EE/DRSP COC found no statistically significant differences in carbohydrate or lipid profiles between the two groups over 6 months of use.</li><li>In a third trial, 174 women were randomised to cyclical or continuous use of 20 micrograms EE/levonorgestrel (LNG) COC (the dose of LNG was different in the two groups). The authors concluded that after 13 months of use, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid profile and haemostatic variables were broadly similar between the groups, but that further studies would be required to assess long-term continuous CHC. Haemostatic parameters were reported to be similar for 187 women randomised to extended or cyclical use of 30 micrograms EE/LNG COC for 6 months.</li></ul></li><li>Limited information is available on the short- and long-term safety of the combined transdermal patch (CTP) and combined vaginal ring (CVR). However, after reviewing the available evidence, the FSRH guideline development group considers that recommendations for COC can be extrapolated to include CTP and CVR.</li></ul><p><strong>Bleeding patterns with extended CHC regimens </strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/contraception-combined-hormonal-methods/references/\">FSRH, 2019</a>]</p><ul><li>A Cochrane Review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported that in most studies bleeding patterns with extended CHC regimens were equivalent or improved compared to standard regimens.</li><li>A systematic review that included both RCTs and observational studies concluded that overall, the total number of days of bleeding was lower with continuous or extended regimens than with cyclical use of CHC. However, there was an increase in breakthrough bleeding during the first months of use of continuous or extended regimens, its frequency and intensity subsequently decreased over time.</li><li>Limited evidence suggests that bleeding patterns with continuous or extended use of the combined transdermal patch (CTP) and combined vaginal ring (CVR) show a similar reduction in bleeding/spotting days over time to that seen with extended use of COC.</li><li>One study compared bleeding patterns in 139 existing cyclic COC users who were randomised to continuous use for 180 days of COC containing 30 micrograms EE/100 micrograms LNG, 20 micrograms EE/100 micrograms LNG, 30 micrograms EE/1000 micrograms norethisterone (NET) or 20 micrograms EE/1000 micrograms NET (only the first of these is available in the UK). The study suggested more favourable bleeding patterns (more amenorrhoea and fewer spotting days) with continuous use of NET COC than with continuous use of LNG COC. The authors noted that the study findings did not support use of higher EE doses to prevent breakthrough bleeding during continuous COC use. It is not known how bleeding patterns with continuous use of other COC would compare.</li></ul><p><strong>Tailored regimens and HFI-associated symptoms </strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/contraception-combined-hormonal-methods/references/\">FSRH, 2019</a>]</p><ul><li>A Cochrane Review of RCTs identified studies that reported improvement in menstrual-related headache, bloating, tiredness and menstrual pain with extended COC regimens.</li><li>Observational studies similarly suggest benefit. <ul><li>A cohort study of 111 women who reported cyclical symptoms with two cycles of use of a 21/7 COC regimen found that mood, headache and pelvic pain scores improved significantly after the women switched to an extended COC regimen and were followed up for a year — 80% of the women continued the extended regimen for the full year, and 6 months after that most women reported that they had continued the extended regimen on their own.</li><li>A prospective cohort study of 109 women given 30 micrograms EE/DRSP COC for two 21/7 cycles, followed by two 84/7 cycles (two-thirds completed all cycles) reported a significantly reduced incidence of heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), intermenstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhoea, abdominal bloating, depressed mood and irritability at the end of the second 84/7 cycle compared to at enrolment.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Return to fertility after tailored regimens </strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/contraception-combined-hormonal-methods/references/\">FSRH, 2019</a>]</p><ul><li><p>One study found that of 187 women aged 18–49 years who had used continuous 20 micrograms EE/ LNG COC for at least 6 months, 98.9% returned to spontaneous menstruation or became pregnant within 90 days. In another study, amongst 47 women who had used 20 micrograms EE/LNG COC continuously for 84 days, ovulation was observed within 37 days of stopping treatment in all but one case (98%).</p></li></ul><!-- end field 55073596-b155-4542-832e-a6ce00dc78c1 --><!-- end item 335aba0a-d53a-4728-80f9-a6ce00dc76ea -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"890b3ff3-1031-5258-900a-7486a510e0f6","slug":"risks-adverse-effects","fullItemName":"Risks and adverse effects","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field e58c1eb3-d9dd-4f44-bf48-d22a34054f14 --><h3>What are the possible risks and adverse effects of the combined transdermal patch?</h3><!-- end field e58c1eb3-d9dd-4f44-bf48-d22a34054f14 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 1bf883c5-c9f7-452b-a187-970d39e7f7fa --><!-- begin field 957d5db5-1959-4e83-9d6d-c89ffc3d6e67 --><ul><li>The risks and adverse effects of the combined transdermal patch are the same as the adverse effects for combined oral contraceptives (COCs).
