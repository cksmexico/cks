One review was published by the Cochrane Collaboration [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">Gava et al, 2007</a>] and a second was commissioned by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2006</a>]. Both of these reviews were limited by issues of external validity: it is difficult, in practice, to differentiate between ERP, other types of CBT, cognitive therapy, and behavioural therapy, and there is considerable overlap [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">Gava et al, 2007</a>]. Indeed, in contrast to NICE, the Cochrane review makes no distinction between ERP and other forms of CBT in its meta-analysis. Subsequent to the publication of the NICE and Cochrane systematic reviews CKS identified two smaller systematic reviews, the results of which are consistent with those of the Cochrane and NICE reviews [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">Jonsson and Hougaard, 2009</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">Olatunji et al, 2013</a>].</li><li><strong>Psychological treatments versus treatment as usual </strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">Gava et al, 2007</a>]<strong>:</strong><ul><li>Included 11 studies, seven (ten comparisons) of which had usable data for meta-analysis (241 participants).</li><li>All psychological treatments were superior to treatment as usual in reducing obsessive-compulsive symptoms as measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) (standardized mean difference, SMD –1.24, 95% CI –1.61 to –0.87).</li><li>CBT (with or without ERP) was superior to treatment as usual in reducing the Y-BOCS (WMD –7.73, 95% CI –9.92 to –5.55).</li><li>Behavioural therapy was superior to treatment as usual (weighted mean difference, WMD –11.73, 95% CI –14.52 to –8.95).</li><li>There was no statistically significant difference between cognitive therapy and treatment as usual (SMD –1.21, 95% CI –2.66 to +0.25) but, with just 39 subjects, the numbers were perhaps too small to detect a difference.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Psychological interventions versus control (systematic relaxation, anxiety management or waiting list):</strong><ul><li>The NICE review included 17 studies with efficacy data on 820 participants and tolerability data on 734 participants [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2006</a>]<strong>:</strong><ul><li>NICE found one small study which showed that ERP is superior to anxiety management control in reducing clinician-rated Y-BOCS (n = 18; SMD –2.89, 95% CI –4.30 to –1.48); one further study found statistically significant differences compared with systematic relaxation control in favour of both clinician-guided ERP (n = 121; SMD –1.10, 95% CI –1.49 to –0.72) and computer-guided ERP (n = 121; SMD –0.68, 95% CI –1.05 to –0.31). When both studies were combined, no significant difference between groups was detected in the number of withdrawals (relative risk, RR 4.47, 95% CI 0.51 to 38.92).</li><li>One study found group-CBT to be superior to waiting list control in terms of both treatment response (35% or greater reduction in clinician-led Y-BOCS) (n = 47; RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.59) and reduction in clinician-rated Y-BOCS (n = 47; SMD –1.18, 95% CI –1.98 to –0.38). Another study also found a small but statistically significant reduction in OCD symptoms (as measured by clinician-rated Y-BOCS) for CBT compared with waiting list (n = 29; SMD –1.18, 95% CI –1.81 to –0.56). No significant difference in rates of withdrawal was found between each group in both studies.</li></ul></li><li>A recently published systematic review included 16 randomised controlled trials that compared the efficacy of CBT with control conditions [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">Olatunji et al, 2013</a>]. The primary outcome measured was the difference between Y-BOCS and the children's Y-BOCS scores pre and post treatment. This review found evidence that CBT was superior to control conditions at post treatment. The effect size (measured using a Hedges g score) was 1.39 (95% CI 1.04–1.74, p = 0.0000).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Therapist time in psychological interventions</strong><ul><li>NICE commissioned a systematic review to determine whether the number of hours spent by a therapist per client predicted the efficacy of psychological interventions in adults with OCD [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2006</a>].</li><li>Across all 29 studies, there was statistically significant heterogeneity.</li><li>Effect sizes demonstrated a gradient favouring higher intensity over lower intensity:<ul><li>Low intensity group: n = 261; SMD –0.93, 95% CI –1.11 to –0.75.</li><li>Medium intensity group: n = 461; SMD –1.44, 95% CI –1.59 to –1.29.</li><li>High intensity group: n = 157; SMD –1.65, 95% CI –1.91 to –1.38.</li></ul></li><li>Using meta-regression analysis to control for publication date, study design, and treatment modality, the number of therapist-hours per client significantly predicted change in efficacy scores following treatment (z = –2.09; p = 0.04), and this result was unaffected by removing outliers.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Individual CBT versus group CBT</strong><ul><li>A systematic review assessed the efficacy of group ERP or group CBT with placebo, waiting list or other active treatments [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">Jonsson and Hougaard, 2009</a>]. This review identified 13 trials, however, only four of these were randomised controlled trials. The primary outcome measure was the difference in effect size pre and post treatment using the YBOCS. Pooled data for three randomised controlled trials found that group CBT or group ERP was superior to waiting list control. The effect size was 1.12 (95% CI 0.78–1.46).</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 76bc1a0b-7bd7-424c-b49e-2c5ffafaaf72 --><!-- end item c6a41191-4a82-48b1-9dfd-e90cee7a0183 -->","topic":{"id":"1f37cc0e-7573-58d0-a414-18973c123eae","topicId":"394f419d-3ab3-4fd3-85c7-7ae0c286d323","topicName":"Obsessive-compulsive disorder","slug":"obsessive-compulsive-disorder","lastRevised":"Last revised in June 2018","chapters":[{"id":"6854ef67-5e05-528c-afeb-b7680f464892","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"0151ee13-83cc-5d06-9ce4-f03bc14a2d91","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"a6ac8f0f-9ef4-5778-82e7-0ee23afbaaf8","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"f571042f-c058-5f39-a22d-6901a3f9f4d0","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"31a9215e-18d0-5bd1-9341-846c7185dd16","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"39a21515-e7bc-515d-80d4-420f429a801f","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"9c01874c-054d-55f7-bc72-c5dc572bb4ce","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"bb1af94d-3d5a-5862-9e75-51cfd39e9e31","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"31dd33b1-cd86-57bc-84c1-206363cae677","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"8aa2028a-8646-59f5-ac0b-c585d5f9474a","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"96f32bee-6f1f-5862-8163-8f9adf02e81e","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP - Options for local implementation"},{"id":"0c41f244-6591-5043-825b-f48000a19060","slug":"nice-quality-standards","fullItemName":"NICE quality standards"}]},{"id":"69296d43-e92e-51ad-803f-9b00dd4ef3eb","fullItemName":"Background information","slug":"background-information","subChapters":[{"id":"23304d59-7975-500a-9672-1d71c224d42b","slug":"definition","fullItemName":"Definition"},{"id":"75facf2a-3aa9-52ec-a213-c09d7c49305a","slug":"risk-factors","fullItemName":"Risk factors"},{"id":"ef703cf4-f71d-53e8-ac6e-55fd3949af89","slug":"prevalence","fullItemName":"Prevalence"},{"id":"16615ebe-7c11-54ea-8c8f-11b27bd84df0","slug":"prognosis","fullItemName":"Prognosis"},{"id":"9c3a46c7-846c-5e14-9297-e80dfc82ffa5","slug":"complications","fullItemName":"Complications"}]},{"id":"9063127c-d315-5f06-81a4-0854a79730a5","fullItemName":"Diagnosis","slug":"diagnosis","subChapters":[{"id":"8e2a1f2f-09ef-5f73-a3ec-2aac2b0a90b7","slug":"diagnosis","fullItemName":"Diagnosis"}]},{"id":"d07d5382-3d58-534c-80b0-ebb514c9d790","fullItemName":"Management","slug":"management","subChapters":[{"id":"adfa1e25-924b-5e4d-b909-bbd62bfa3981","slug":"management","fullItemName":"Scenario: Management"}]},{"id":"1a83f73e-9ca7-5f30-9cda-aaa563048a36","fullItemName":"Prescribing information","slug":"prescribing-information","subChapters":[{"id":"0b63ad08-27a9-5af8-8fb8-6940aa3d3dc3","slug":"ssris","fullItemName":"SSRIs"},{"id":"32401b30-535f-57bf-8154-4e5efa0884e3","slug":"clomipramine","fullItemName":"Clomipramine"}]},{"id":"34094942-974d-50ae-b83e-52a2243c1e47","fullItemName":"Supporting evidence","slug":"supporting-evidence","subChapters":[{"id":"06ebd4e9-a6ff-5645-8bf1-4a06d03e073b","slug":"psychological-treatments-in-adults","fullItemName":"Psychological treatments in adults"},{"id":"73a36a4c-8f66-5d63-a4ad-c1667bd42f3b","slug":"ssris-in-adults","fullItemName":"SSRIs in adults"},{"id":"f077f54e-c77f-533b-84b3-6f81c9eb4f89","slug":"pharmacological-versus-psychological-treatments-in-adults","fullItemName":"Pharmacological versus psychological treatments in adults"},{"id":"d63bb159-7b2d-54b3-a251-0fb81b09618f","slug":"combination-treatments-in-adults","fullItemName":"Combination treatments in adults"}]},{"id":"ed477751-4d36-5e3b-bfcb-60739e1daea7","fullItemName":"How this topic was developed","slug":"how-this-topic-was-developed","subChapters":[{"id":"6e26607d-6208-5c71-a5ee-ba2bd8567311","slug":"search-strategy","fullItemName":"Search strategy"},{"id":"700ff2f4-6d6b-5235-8301-91ad6701f206","slug":"stakeholder-engagement","fullItemName":"Stakeholder engagement"},{"id":"20682403-8c70-5f97-86c4-1f8234b42261","slug":"evidence-exclusion-criteria","fullItemName":"Evidence exclusion criteria"},{"id":"9242ca74-0efb-54f8-9cb4-267acc46dc6c","slug":"organizational-behavioural-financial-barriers","fullItemName":"Organizational, behavioural and financial barriers"},{"id":"8a264e61-1997-5859-8b1d-e1d859ffa219","slug":"declarations-of-interest","fullItemName":"Declarations of interest"}]},{"id":"c91ccb0b-b8e6-5c2a-ab14-79b9eff3e63a","fullItemName":"References","slug":"references","subChapters":[]}]},"parentChapter":{"id":"34094942-974d-50ae-b83e-52a2243c1e47","slug":"supporting-evidence","fullItemName":"Supporting evidence"},"subChapters":[]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
