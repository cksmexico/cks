Following assessment, a low intensity cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), including exposure and response prevention (ERP) may be offered. The format for low-intensity CBT should be up to 10 therapist-hours per person, of one of the following:<ul><li>Brief individual CBT (including ERP) with structured self-help materials.</li><li>Brief individual CBT (including ERP) by phone.</li><li>Group CBT (including ERP) which may be for more than 10 hours.</li></ul></li><li>If the person has been unable to engage in low-intensity CBT (including ERP) or the response is inadequate, treat as for moderate functional impairment.</li></ul></li><li><strong>For adults with moderate functional impairment, </strong>if you are confident of your assessment of moderate functional impairment (expert opinion suggests that it is easy to underestimate this):<ul><li>Offer the choice of intensive CBT including ERP (accessed by referral or self referral to <a data-hyperlink-id=\"a9484ae4-be6e-404a-9f55-a90a00e23e13\" href=\"http://www.iapt.nhs.uk/services/services/\">IAPT</a>), or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (see below). </li><li>Consider prescribing clomipramine (as an alternative first-line drug treatment to an SSRI) if the person prefers clomipramine or has had a previous good response to it, or if an SSRI is contraindicated.

Explain that adverse effects early in treatment with an SSRI may include increased anxiety, agitation, and sleeping problems.</li><li>Advise the person that in OCD, when compared with depression, treatment with an SSRI usually requires a higher dose and a longer duration of treatment (at least 12 weeks) for an initial response.</li><li><strong>Be aware that in a minority of people aged under 30 years of age, SSRIs are associated with an increased risk of suicidal thinking and self-harm.</strong> Anyone in this age group receiving an SSRI should therefore be seen within 1 week of first prescribing, and the risk of suicidal thinking and self-harm should be <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/management/management/#monitoring\">monitored</a> weekly for the first month. </li><li>When adults with comorbid depression are assessed to be at a high risk of suicide, the use of additional support such as more frequent direct contacts with primary care staff or telephone contacts should be considered, particularly during the first weeks of treatment. For people at high risk of suicide, a limited quantity of medication should be prescribed.</li><li>Adults started on SSRIs who are not considered to be at increased risk of suicide or self-harm should be <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/management/management/#monitoring\">monitored</a> closely — the effectiveness and adverse effects of the drug should ideally be reviewed every 2 to 4 weeks during the first 3 months of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. Dose adjustment may be required. Bear in mind that an absence of clinical benefit within four weeks suggests that a response to unchanged treatment is unlikely, but that the full efficacy of the drug may take up to 12 weeks to be realised.</li><li>For more information on prescribing an SSRI, please see the relevant sections in <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/prescribing-information/\">Prescribing information</a>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>When prescribing clomipramine, </strong>be aware of the need to <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/management/management/#monitoring\">monitor</a> patients for the emergence of other psychiatric symptoms, as well as the emergence of suicidality. Advise the person to report such symptoms immediately.<ul><li>For more information on prescribing clomipramine, please see the relevant section in <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/prescribing-information/\">Prescribing information</a>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>If a pregnant woman requires treatment for OCD:</strong><ul><li>If drug treatment is considered necessary in the first trimester (such as in a women for whom psychological intervention has proved ineffective), the potential risks and benefits should be discussed. For example, it is still unclear whether SSRIs used in the first trimester may slightly increase the risk of infant congenital heart defects above the background rate of approximately 1 in 100. This must be balanced against the risks to both mother and fetus if the maternal condition is not optimally controlled. Consider discussion with a specialist in obstetrics for women who may require SSRI medication in pregnancy. </li><li>If a woman with OCD who is stabilised on current treatment reports a pregnancy, the risk of relapse must be taken into account when considering discontinuing or switching medication. In cases where drug treatment is continued in pregnancy, the lowest effective dose should be used. Consider discussion with a specialist in obstetrics for women who may require changes to their SSRI medication in pregnancy. </li><li>Treatment with an SSRI after around 20 weeks of pregnancy may raise the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) and/or can lead to neonatal withdrawal. Women using these medications should therefore be advised to give birth at a unit with the facilities to provide treatment and support for these conditions.</li><li>Patient information leaflets on use of drugs to treat OCD in pregnancy are available at <a data-hyperlink-id=\"0ecfb63b-c59b-4228-aabb-a90a00d6171c\" href=\"http://www.medicinesinpregnancy.org/\">medicinesinpregnancy.org</a>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>For children and young people (under the age of 18 years) with mild functional impairment:</strong><ul><li>If confident of the diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and that functional impairment is mild, refer for guided self-help in conjunction with support and information for the family or carers to your local service provider.</li><li>If guided self-help is unavailable or ineffective, refer to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).</li></ul></li><li><strong>For children and young people (under the age of 18 years) with moderate-to-severe functional impairment:</strong><ul><li>Refer to CAMHS.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Note: a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) should only be prescribed to people under 18 years of age following assessment and diagnosis by a child and adolescent psychiatrist.</strong></li><li><strong>Arrange active <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/management/management/#monitoring\">monitoring</a> of the person's symptoms, functioning, and response to treatment (if applicable) at intervals determined by clinical judgement.</strong></li></ul><!-- end field 86a03560-29ee-417b-a116-66fb3693e348 --><!-- end item 8ef4d847-3ae5-4ed1-93dd-708bfc36f8d5 -->","subChapters":[{"id":"14e32edf-b0be-524c-9e7a-d04048b6c847","slug":"yale-brown-obsessive-compulsive-scale","fullItemName":"Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 6927a065-5cf7-473d-b95c-cae357c6ee9b --><h4>Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale</h4><!-- end field 6927a065-5cf7-473d-b95c-cae357c6ee9b -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item eb253805-2229-40d8-a419-f95769ca7c34 --><!-- begin field 3d8d1427-8bb4-498b-8dd6-3f5d72d84176 --><ul><li>This list of questions, derived from the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), is included as a guide — see <a data-hyperlink-id=\"d0c164b2-0828-45b8-87e2-a93100a084cc\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150502042646/http://www.stlocd.org/handouts/YBOC-Symptom-Checklist.pdf\">Y-BOCS</a> for a full symptom checklist, and <a data-hyperlink-id=\"a1f1b4d6-63e9-404a-8a2e-a93100a08735\" href=\"http://ocd.stanford.edu/about/diagnosis.html\">http://ocd.stanford.edu</a> for interpretation of the score:<ul><li>How much of your day is occupied by obsessive thoughts or spent performing compulsive acts (mild, less than 1 hour; moderate, 1–3 hours; severe, more than 3 hours)?</li><li>How much do your obsessive thoughts or compulsive behaviours interfere with your social or work/school functioning (including relationships)?</li><li>How much distress do your obsessive thoughts cause you?

Advise the person to report cardiac symptoms such as palpitations, vertigo, syncope, or seizures and if these develop during treatment, arrange for the person to have an ECG.</li></ul></li><li><strong>If a drug is effective, advise the person to continue taking it for at least a year.</strong><ul></ul></li><li><strong>Re-evaluate the required frequency of follow-up based on:</strong><ul><li>The person's preference.</li><li>Severity of symptoms</li><li>Comorbid conditions.</li><li>Change since last review and response to interventions.</li><li>Symptoms during treatment changes.</li></ul></li><li><strong>When an adult with OCD has taken an SSRI or clomipramine for 12 months after remission (symptoms are not clinically significant and the person is fully functioning for at least 12 weeks), review the need for continued treatment.</strong><ul><li>Consider the severity and duration of the initial illness, the number of previous episodes, the presence of residual symptoms, and concurrent psychosocial difficulties.</li><li>If treatment is continued for an extended period beyond 12 months after remission, the need for continuation should be reviewed at regular intervals and written in the notes.</li><li>When reducing or stopping SSRIs or clomipramine, the dose should be tapered gradually over at least several weeks, according to the person's need. The rate of reduction should take into account the starting dose, the drug half-life and particular profiles of adverse effects. Advise the person to seek advice if they experience significant discontinuation/withdrawal symptoms.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field ba7d0d3b-55dc-4a5a-a5b8-a90a016ca61a --><!-- end item 161dd7f3-4def-4d26-8127-a90a016ca356 -->","subChapters":[]},{"id":"bb05a9e9-2b6c-5084-a05d-369cdfb89621","slug":"basis-for-recommendation-5c5","fullItemName":"Basis for recommendation","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field c50fb864-c547-4d79-85d6-a6b800de787c --><h4>Basis for recommendation</h4><!-- end field c50fb864-c547-4d79-85d6-a6b800de787c -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 5c5eeb76-5a6d-4728-8b15-a6b800de7686 --><!-- begin field 7dcf7143-016f-4585-b826-a6b800de787c --><p>The recommendations on management of people with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are largely based on the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Guideline <em>Obsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder: treatment</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">NICE, 2005</a>] and the full version of this guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2006</a>].</p><h5>Assessing severity of functional impairment</h5><ul><li>NICE recommends initial treatments for OCD according to whether the level of functional impairment is mild, moderate, or severe, but does not suggest how the severity of functional impairment should be assessed [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">NICE, 2005</a>].</li><li>CKS found no published evidence specifically relating to the most appropriate method of assessing severity of functional impairment in people with OCD in primary care. Recommendations are therefore largely based on expert opinion [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">Freeston, Personal Communication, 2008</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">Williams, Personal Communication, 2008</a>] and also from information in the BMJ Best Practice guideline <em>Obsessive-compulsive disorder</em>, which suggests use of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) by 'therapists' [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2017a</a>].</li></ul><h5>Suicide risk</h5><ul><li>NICE advises that people with severe OCD, particularly with comorbid depression, should be assessed for risk of suicide [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">NICE, 2005</a>].</li><li>The advice on how to assess suicide risk is derived from information within the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline <em>Depression in adults: recognition and managemen</em>t [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>], the British Columbia Medical Association guideline <em>Major depressive disorder in adults - diagnosis and management </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">British Columbia Medical Association, 2013</a>], and the Singapore Ministry of Health guideline <em>Depression </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">Singapore Ministry of Health, 2012</a>].</li><li>The information on comorbidities that should prompt assessment of suicide risk is extrapolated from the NICE guideline <em>Depression in adults: recognition and </em><em>managemen</em>t [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>].</li></ul><h5>Safeguarding issues</h5><ul><li>The advice to assess for safeguarding issues is pragmatic, based on the fact that NICE states that 'Part of the risk assessment [for OCD] should include the impact of their compulsive behaviours on themselves or others'  [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">NICE, 2005</a>].</li><li>NICE guidelines on depression also state that marital and family relationships are frequently negatively affected, and parental depression may lead to neglect of children and significant disturbances in children [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>]. CKS has extrapolated this advice to also potentially apply to people with OCD, particularly as those severely affected may also have comorbid depression.</li></ul><h5>Frequency of monitoring</h5><ul><li>The advice on frequency of monitoring for people on SSRIs with or without risk factors for suicide is extrapolated from expert opinion within the NICE guideline <em>Generalised anxiety disorder and panic disorder in adults: management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">NICE, 2011</a>].</li></ul><h5>Clomipramine</h5><ul><li>The advice relating to monitoring people who are prescribed clomipramine for the emergence of other psychiatric symptoms and suicidality, and also regarding the monitoring of cardiac function during long-term therapy,  and gradual drug withdrawal, is contained within the summary of product characteristics for clomipramine [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">ABPI, 2017a</a>].</li><li>The advice to monitor cardiac function in people undergoing long-term clomipramine treatment is contained within the summary of product characteristics for clomipramine [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">ABPI, 2017a</a>]. In the absence of any specific information relating to the frequency of monitoring, the recommendation to apply clinical judgement to routine monitoring, and to arrange immediate monitoring if cardiac symptoms emerge, is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good medical practice.</li></ul><h5>Pregnant women</h5><ul><li>The information on use of SSRIs in pregnant women with OCD is extrapolated from expert opinion in the BMJ Best Practice guideline <em>Generalised anxiety disorder </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2017b</a>], and from a UK Teratology Information Service (UKTIS) monograph on use of SSRIs in pregnancy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">UKTIS, 2017</a>].</li></ul><h5>Children</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to refer children and young people with moderate or severe functional impairment to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) is based on a Department of Health recommendation that family and individual therapies for disorders of childhood and adolescence should normally take place within secondary care [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/references/\">RCPsych and RCGP, 2008</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field 7dcf7143-016f-4585-b826-a6b800de787c --><!-- end item 5c5eeb76-5a6d-4728-8b15-a6b800de7686 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
