It is not part of the normal skin flora, but there may be transient colonization of fingers or body folds. </li><li>Colonization with <em>Candida</em><em> </em>is usually asymptomatic. However, if mucosal barriers are disrupted or defences lowered, it can cause infections ranging from non-life threatening superficial mucocutaneous disorders to invasive disseminated disease involving multiple organs. <em>Candida albicans </em>is the most common species that can cause infection in humans.</li><li>Candidal skin infections are common and are more likely to occur where skin rubs on skin (such as between skin folds) and where heat and moisture lead to maceration and inflammation.</li><li>The diagnosis of candidal skin infection is usually made as a result of typical presenting clinical features; investigations are usually unnecessary. An underlying cause should be excluded if the skin infection is widespread or recurrent.</li><li>If systemic candidiasis is suspected (for example there is peritonitis or meningitis), hospital admission should be arranged.</li><li>If the infection is not widespread and the person is not significantly immunocompromised:<ul><li>Adults should be treated with a topical imidazole (clotrimazole, econazole, miconazole, or ketoconazole) or topical terbinafine.</li><li>Children should be treated with topical clotrimazole, econazole, or miconazole.</li></ul></li><li>If inflammation or itch are particularly problematic, a mildly potent corticosteroid cream (for example hydrocortisone 1%) should be prescribed (in addition to the topical antifungal cream) to be used once or twice a day for 7 days after which the person should be reviewed:<ul><li>If there has been a significant improvement in symptoms, treatment should be continued for a further 7 days.</li><li>If there is no response to treatment, treatment should be discontinued and the diagnosis reassessed. </li></ul></li><li>If topical treatment is ineffective, infection is widespread, or the person is significantly immunocompromised: <ul><li>For people aged 16 years and older, oral fluconazole should be prescribed for 2 weeks after which response to treatment should be reviewed. If the infection has not completely resolved, consideration should be given to treating with oral fluconazole for a further 2 weeks (referral should be arranged if the infection persists after this); swabbing to identify the causative organism; seeking specialist advice; or arranging referral to a dermatologist. Clinical judgement should be used, taking into account the severity of infection (there should be a low threshold for early referral if infection is severe), the level of immunocompromise, and the response to treatment. </li><li>For children younger than 16 years of age, or if fluconazole is contraindicated, specialist advice should be sought.</li></ul></li><li>People with candidal skin infection should be advised to:<ul><li>Avoid skin occlusion when possible.</li><li>Wash skin regularly with a soap substitute and ensure it is dried adequately.</li><li>Lose weight, if obesity is a contributing factor.</li></ul></li><li>Referral to a dermatologist should also be arranged if:<ul><li>There is widespread or recurrent infection for which an underlying cause has not been identified in primary care.</li><li>The diagnosis is uncertain.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 1c3f0508-05f4-4b42-ac98-cf359843540f --><!-- end item 692c4c73-aaf1-472c-be22-313de7bd344c -->","topic":{"id":"0d4d1ca9-1f95-59a6-9163-91faf2fce35e","topicId":"44d93cc7-56e9-4f35-92ee-6fe5c97d5646","topicName":"Candida -
