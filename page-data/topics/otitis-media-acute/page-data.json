Younger children may hold or rub their ear, or may have non-specific symptoms such as fever, crying, poor feeding, restlessness, cough, or rhinorrhoea.</li><li>On examination the tympanic membrane is distinctly red, yellow, or cloudy and may be bulging.</li><li>Pain and fever should be managed with paracetamol or ibuprofen.</li><li>Many people with AOM will not need antibiotic treatment as symptoms usually resolve spontaneously within a few days. However, antibiotics are necessary in a number of situations, including for:<ul><li>People who are systemically very unwell.</li><li>People who have symptoms and signs of a more serious illness or condition.</li><li>People who have a high risk of complications.</li></ul></li><li>If an antibiotic is required, a 5–7 day course of amoxicillin is recommended first-line. Clarithromycin or erythromycin are alternatives for people who are allergic to penicillin (erythromycin is preferred in pregnant women).</li><li>The following groups of people should be admitted to hospital for immediate specialist assessment:<ul><li>People with a severe systemic infection.</li><li>People with suspected complications of AOM, such as meningitis, mastoiditis, intracranial abscess, sinus thrombosis, or facial nerve paralysis.</li><li>Children younger than 3 months of age with a temperature of 38°C or more.</li></ul></li><li>Management of persistent AOM involves:<ul><li>Reassessing the person.</li><li>Considering the need for paediatric or ENT referral or admission, depending on the clinical situation.</li><li>Considering a first-line antibiotic (if not already prescribed) or a second-line antibiotic if the initial treatment was ineffective.</li></ul></li><li>Measures to prevent recurrent AOM include:<ul><li>In children — avoiding exposure to passive smoking, use of dummies, and flat, supine feeding; and ensuring that children have had a complete course of pneumococcal vaccinations as part of the routine childhood immunization schedule.</li><li>In adults — avoiding smoking and/or passive smoking.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 850a35b0-13e0-4a21-9eb5-b2b35733b282 --><!-- end item c0fde562-cd6b-4779-8cd1-f988b737303c -->","topic":{"id":"0671aacb-4e00-5bb2-8b54-aa0da27fb4ab","topicId":"009f13e7-d649-401b-8b63-061c029e67f2","topicName":"Otitis media -
