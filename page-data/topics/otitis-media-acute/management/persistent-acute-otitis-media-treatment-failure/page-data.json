This is also consistent with advice in the NICE guideline <em>Otitis media (acute): antimicrobial prescribing </em>regarding children with fever [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">NICE, 2018a</a>].  </li><li>Specific evidence on the most appropriate management of children younger than 3 months of age with suspected AOM is limited.<ul><li>CKS recommends considering admission in this age group on the basis of expert opinion in a US guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">University of Michigan Health System, 2013</a>] which suggests that AOM may be associated with an increased risk of 'a severe or atypical outcome' in infants less than 8 weeks old.</li></ul></li><li>According to the NICE guideline <em>Feverish illness in children — Assessment and initial management in children younger than 5 years</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">NICE, 2013</a>], children aged 3–6 months with a temperature of 39ºC or more are in at least an intermediate risk group for serious illness, so CKS advises using clinical judgement to consider admitting this group.</li></ul><h5>Self care advice for all people with acute otitis media</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the NICE guideline <em>Otitis media (acute): antimicrobial prescribing </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">NICE, 2018a</a>]. </li><li>A Cochrane systematic review (search date August 2016) on paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for pain relief in acute otitis media in children included three randomised controlled trials (n = 327). The Cochrane authors were unable to draw conclusions on the comparative efficacy of paracetamol and ibuprofen due to insufficient available evidence. Low-quality evidence suggested that paracetamol and ibuprofen, when used individually, were more effective than placebo in terms of pain relief at 48 hours [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">Sjoukes et al, 2016</a>]:   <ul><li>Paracetamol compared with placebo (n = 148): 10% compared with 25% of children with pain at 48 hours; RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.85.</li><li>Ibuprofen commpared with placebo (n = 146): 7% compared with 25% of children with pain at 48 hours; RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.70.</li><li>The number needed to treat to benefit was calculated as 7 for paracetamol and 6 for ibuprofen.</li><li>Adverse effects were not significantly different between the groups (based on very low-quality evidence), but the sample sizes were small and the adverse effects were infrequent [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">NICE, 2018a</a>]. </li></ul></li></ul><h5>Use of antibiotics</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is extrapolated from the NICE guideline <em>Otitis media (acute): antimicrobial prescribing </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">NICE, 2018a</a>]. This advises that most people get better within 3 days without antibiotics and recommends using a back up antibiotic prescription if symptoms do not start to improve within 3 days with watchful waiting. It therefore seems reasonable to prescribe an antibiotic for a person for whom an episode of AOM fails to improve or worsens who has not already had antibiotic treatment.</li><li>This is supported by a US guideline which advises starting antibiotic treatment if a child with AOM worsens or does not improve within 48–72 hours of symptom onset [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">Lieberthal et al, 2013</a>].  </li></ul><h5>Choice of first-line antibiotics</h5><ul><li>Recommendations on the choice and duration of antibiotic are based on the NICE guideline <em>Otitis media (acute): antimicrobial prescribing </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">NICE, 2018a</a>], the PHE publication <em>Management of infection guidance for primary care for consultation and local adaptation </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">PHE, 2017</a>], the British National Formulary (BNF) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">BNF 75, 2018</a>], and the BNF for Children [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">BNF for Children, 2017</a>]. </li><li>NICE reviewed the evidence in a systematic review and meta-analysis and found no major differences between different classes of antibiotics in terms of treatment effectiveness [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">NICE, 2018a</a>]. <ul><li>The NICE committee therefore based the choice of antibiotic on resistance risk, and decided amoxicillin is most appropriate because although phenoxymethylpenicillin is likely to be effective and has a lower risk of resistance, the use of amoxicillin is current practice with an acceptable resistance risk, and it has a more convenient dosing schedule [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">NICE, 2018a</a>]. </li><li>Clarithromycin and erythromycin are recommended as alternative first-line choices based on the experience of the NICE committee and resistance data. Azithromycin is another option, but this is not recommended because the NICE committee were of the opinion that this should be reserved for more serious infections [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">NICE, 2018a</a>]. <strong> </strong></li></ul></li><li>A Cochrane systematic review (search date November 2009) identified 49 trials (n = 12,045) comparing short courses of antibiotics (less than seven days) with long courses (seven days or longer) for the treatment of AOM in children [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">Kozyrskyj et al, 2010</a>]. The review found that compared with short courses, long courses of antibiotics reduced short-term treatment failure (21% treatment failure for short courses compared with 18% for long courses), but had no benefit in the longer term compared with short courses.<ul><li>The NICE committee reviewed this evidence and concluded that a 5–7 day course of antibiotics is appropriate for acute otitis media in children and that the shortest course possible should be prescribed to minimise the risk of resistance, noting the small absolute difference in treatment failure with antibiotic courses of less than 7 days duration compared with 7 days or more [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">NICE, 2018a</a>].  </li></ul></li></ul><h5>Choice of second-line antibiotics</h5><ul><li>The NICE guideline <em>Otitis media (acute): antimicrobial prescribing </em>recommends co-amoxiclav as a second-choice antibiotic based on RCT evidence, resistance data, and clinical experience. Co-amoxiclav is active against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria that have resistance to amoxicillin, and a lack of response to amoxicillin may indicate resistance is present [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">NICE, 2018a</a>]. Public Health England does not make recommendations on second-line antibiotics for people with persistent AOM [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">PHE, 2017</a>], but this recommendation is in line with advice in a US guideline and Canadian position statement regarding treatment failure in AOM [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">Lieberthal et al, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">Le Saux and Robinson, 2016</a>]. </li><li>The recommendation to consult with a local microbiology department if the first-line antibiotic is not effective in a person with penicillin allergy is based on the NICE guideline <em>Otitis media (acute): antimicrobial prescribing </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">NICE, 2018a</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Persistent symptoms despite two courses of antibiotics</h5><ul><li>In the absence of evidence for the management of people with persistent symptoms after two courses of antibiotics, the recommendation to seek specialist advice is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.<ul><li>US guidelines and a Canadian position statement on the diagnosis and management of acute otitis media suggest a course of intramuscular ceftriaxone for children in the unusual event that symptoms are not improved with co-amoxiclav [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">Lieberthal et al, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">Le Saux and Robinson, 2016</a>], but CKS accepts this is not a practical choice in the UK primary care setting.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field f6bc1b8f-3450-4eb0-9406-a74c00b803e5 --><!-- end item c9a64305-7e9a-4f21-a56d-a74c00b803e5 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
