The recommendation to refer a person with complications is also extrapolated from the NICE guideline <em>Otitis media (acute): antimicrobial prescribing</em>, which advises referral of children and young people who have acute complications and are systemically unwell or have symptoms or signs of a more serious illness or condition [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">NICE, 2018a</a>].</li><li>People with craniofacial abnormalities are generally excluded from trials. Expert opinion in the textbook <em>Advanced therapy of otitis media</em> is that referral is recommended for this group of people because they are at high risk of recurrent AOM and are less likely to spontaneously improve with age [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">Shah, 2003</a>].</li></ul><h5>General management if referral is not necessary</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to manage acute episodes of recurrent acute otitis media in the same way as for initial presentation is extrapolated from expert opinion in a Swedish review article that discusses the use of watchful waiting and antibiotic treatment for children with recurrent acute otitis media experiencing a symptomatic episode [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">Granath, 2017</a>]. This is supported by US guidelines that advise if an episode of AOM occurs more than 14 days after completing antibiotic treatment it should be considered to be a new episode and suggests management as for an initial presentation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">University of Michigan Health System, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h5>Management of people with grommets (tympanostomy tubes) who present with acute discharge</h5><ul><li>There is insufficient evidence on the most effective treatment of AOM in people with grommets (ventilation or tympanostomy tubes). Taking an ear swab for culture and sensitivity is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.<ul><li>Seeking specialist advice is recommended as an alternative to routine management on the basis that topical treatment is advised for people with grommets and otorrhoea by an ENT UK consensus statement [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">Phillips et al, 2007</a>], a US clinical practice guideline on tympanostomy tubes in children [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">Rosenfeld, 2013</a>], and a Swedish review article on the treatment of recurrent otitis media [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">Granath, 2017</a>]. Avoidance of oral antibiotics reduces the risks of their adverse effects and bacterial resistance, but CKS advises seeking specialist advice on choice of topical treatment because of the potential for ototoxicity with aminoglycoside-containing ear drops [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">Rosenfeld, 2013</a>]. </li></ul></li></ul><h5>Measures to prevent recurrence of AOM</h5><ul><li>The recommendations for children are extrapolated from risk factors for AOM discussed in US guidelines on the management of acute otitis media issued by the American Academy of Paediatrics [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">Lieberthal et al, 2013</a>] and the University of Michigan Health Systems [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">University of Michigan Health System, 2013</a>], a Canadian Paediatric Society position statement [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">Le Saux and Robinson, 2016</a>], a clinical guideline published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on <em>Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease: recognition, diagnosis and management in children and young people, </em>which states that gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a risk factor for frequent AOM [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">NICE, 2015b</a>], and expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">Rosa-Olivares et al, 2015</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to ensure that children have had a complete course of pneumococcal vaccinations as part of the routine childhood immunization schedule is also based on evidence from a Cochrane systematic review of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for preventing otitis media [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">Fortanier, 2014</a>], which showed that the pneumococcal vaccine had modest beneficial effects in preventing AOM in healthy infants with a low baseline risk:<ul><li>The 7-valent vaccine reduced overall AOM episodes by 5% in high-risk children and 7% in low-risk children when given in early infancy.</li><li>When the 9-valent vaccine was administered in healthy children aged 12–35 months old, AOM episodes were reduced by 17%.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation for adults is pragmatic, based on the fact that environmental tobacco smoke is a recognized risk factor for developing AOM [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">Lieberthal et al, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2018</a>].  </li></ul><h5>Prophylactic antibiotics</h5><ul><li>There is evidence from a Cochrane systematic review on antibiotics for the prevention of acute and chronic suppurative otitis media in children (n = 1586, search date August 2010 with no change to conclusions) that long-term antibiotics reduce the risk of any further episodes (as well as the number of episodes) of AOM while the person is taking them. For every 12 months of treatment, antibiotics prevented 1.5 episodes of AOM [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">Leach and Morris, 2006</a>]. </li><li>However, CKS has based this recommendation on US guidelines and expert opinion in a review article which, taking into consideration the small reduction of AOM episodes, cost, potential adverse effects, and risk of bacterial resistance, agree that long-term prophylactic antibiotics should not be used to reduce the frequency of episodes for people with recurrent AOM [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">Lieberthal et al, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">University of Michigan Health System, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/otitis-media-acute/references/\">Schilder et al, 2016</a>]. </li></ul><!-- end field 45d1f6d7-4e44-4119-a894-a74c00b85d12 --><!-- end item f6e85c49-1e94-404a-9e83-a74c00b85d12 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
