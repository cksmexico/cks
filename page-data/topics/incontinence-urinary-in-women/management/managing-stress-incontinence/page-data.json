The European Association of Urology (EAU) also notes obesity as a risk factor for urinary incontinence in women and found evidence from three systematic reviews and two RCTs suggesting that urinary incontinence is improved by weight loss [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">EAU, 2018</a>]. </li><li><strong>Smoking</strong> — NICE does not make any recommendations on stopping smoking [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>], however, smoking is associated with stress urinary incontinence and overactive bladder syndrome [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>].<strong> </strong>European guidelines found no evidence that stopping smoking improves urinary incontinence, but acknowledge that smoking cessation is a generalised public health measure, therefore recommends offering smoking cessation advice to people who have urinary incontinence and smoke [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">EAU, 2018</a>]. </li></ul></li></ul><h5>Self-help resources</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to provide information on self-help resources has been extrapolated from expert opinion in the NICE guideline <em>The management of lower urinary tract symptoms in men </em>published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">NICE, 2010</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Referral for pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT)</h5><ul><li>For stress incontinence, evidence indicates that surgery is more effective than pelvic floor muscle training. However, the 2019 NICE guideline committee noted the risks of surgery compared with pelvic floor muscle training. They found evidence suggesting that around half of women with stress incontinence experience the same effectiveness from pelvic floor muscle training as for surgery, and recommended pelvic floor muscle training as a first-line treatment in this group [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>]. </li><li>NICE found evidence that daily PFMT is an effective treatment in women with stress and mixed urinary incontinence compared with no treatment. The only adverse effects are occasional pain and discomfort. Clear evidence on an optimal training regimen is lacking. NICE therefore adopted the minimum number of pelvic floor exercises advised across the studies (that is, 24; eight contractions three times a day). As most studies evaluated 3 months of treatment, NICE considered this an appropriate duration of PFMT to recommend [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>]. This is consistent with an evidence review and recommendations in the EAU guideline <em>Urinary incontinence</em> that found a benefit of pelvic floor muscles training over no treatment for improving urinary incontinence and quality of life in women with stress and mixed urinary incontinence [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">EAU, 2018</a>]. </li><li>A Cochrane systematic review (search date February 2018) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">Dumoulin et al, 2018</a>]<strong> </strong>assessed the effects of PFMT in women with urinary incontinence and found that, for women with stress incontinence, compared with inactive control or no treatment, women in the PFMT groups were more likely to report:<ul><li>Cure in four high-quality trials of 165 women (risk ratio RR 8.38, 95% CI 3.68 to 19.07).</li><li>Improvement in symptoms or cure in three moderate-quality trials involving 242 women (RR 6.33, 95% CI 3.88 to 10.33).</li><li>Significant improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms in seven moderate-quality trials (n = 376).</li><li>Significant improvement in urinary incontinence quality of life in six low-quality trials (n = 348). </li></ul></li></ul><h5>Absorbent products, hand-held urinals, and toileting aids</h5><ul><li>The 2019 NICE guideline committee found no evidence on the use of absorbent containment products for urinary incontinence and noted potential adverse effects in the long term on skin integrity (including breakdown of vulval skin). Annual review of the use of these products by a continence-trained healthcare professional was considered important to enable prompt identification of problems and discussion of management options [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>].</li></ul><h5>Referral</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to refer the woman to secondary care if conservative treatments have failed, and the information on potential treatment options in secondary care, is based on expert opinion from NICE [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>]. The opinion of the NICE GDG was that conservative management should be pursued prior to surgical procedures, and the NICE quality standard <em>Urinary incontinence in women</em> states that surgery or other invasive treatments may be considered if symptoms associated with stress urinary incontinence are not adequately treated by conservative and pharmacological management [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">NICE, 2015a</a>]. </li><li>Expert opinion in a review article notes that if initial treatment is not successful, an incontinence specialist can decide if there is a need for further diagnostic tests [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">Lukacz et al, 2017</a>]. </li><li>Examples of treatment options in secondary care are based on the NICE guideline <em>Urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse in women: management </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>].</li></ul><h5>Duloxetine</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the NICE guideline, <em>Urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse in women: management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>].<ul><li>NICE found studies of up to 12 weeks' duration indicating a reduction in leakage episodes, increased voiding interval, and improved quality of life with duloxetine in women with stress urinary incontinence or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence.
