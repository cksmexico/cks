This meta-analysis of placebo controlled trials showed no statistically significant difference in effectiveness between the 13 antimuscarinic drugs compared, including darifenacin, fesoterodine, oxybutynin (immediate release, extended release, transdermal, and topical gel), propiverine (immediate release and extended release), solifenacin, tolterodine (immediate and extended release), and trospium (immediate and extended release); except for superiority of solifenacin, fesoterodine and trospium (extended release) over tolterodine (extended release) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>]. Oxybutynin (immediate release), propiverine (immediate release), and fesoterodine all had clinically significantly higher discontinuation rates than the other antimuscarinic drugs.<ul><li>The NICE GDG concluded that none of the 13 antimuscarinic drugs can be recommended or removed solely on the clinical data presented.</li></ul></li><li>The EAU recommends offering antimuscarinic drugs if conservative treatment fails, but found limited evidence of superiority of one antimuscarinic drug over another for the outcomes of cure or improvement of urge urinary incontinence [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">EAU, 2018</a>].</li><li>A health economic model identified by NICE showed that oxybutynin (immediate release), despite its higher discontinuation rates, was the most cost-effective option when compared with all other antimuscarinic drugs except for tolterodine (immediate release) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>]. <ul><li>The NICE GDG was aware of the perception that oxybutynin (immediate release) is not well tolerated by women and therefore recommended tolterodine (immediate release) as an alternative for an immediate release antimuscarinic preparation. They also acknowledged that some women would prefer a once daily preparation and therefore included darifenacin as a once daily preparation as it was the most cost-effective drug in this group.</li><li>The NICE GDG made no recommendation on the use of a second-line drug due to the lack of evidence for the efficacy of a second-line antimuscarinic drug if a first-line drug has failed. However, they recommend that if a woman would like to use another overactive bladder drug before considering other treatment options, the choice of drug should be guided by cost.</li></ul></li><li>A meta-analysis noted the modest improvement in symptoms with anticholinergic drugs to treat overactive bladder, rarely curing symptoms [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">Reynolds et al, 2015</a>]. A subsequent network meta-analysis (search date February 2017) on anticholinergic treatment for overactive bladder found similar effects with all anticholinergic drugs and identified no best treatment in terms of improvement or cure (differences were small and unlikely to be clinically important) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">Herbison and McKenzie, 2019</a>].  </li><li>The NICE committee for the 2019 guideline acknowledged the lack of evidence on how anticholinergic medicines for overactive bladder affect women's cognitive function. They recommended a full discussion with the woman, considering her anticholinergic load, and regular reviews, since the long-term effects of anticholinergic medicines are not certain [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Mirabegron drug treatment</h5><ul><li>NICE recommends mirabegron, based on evidence from a technology appraisal, as a treatment for people with overactive bladder syndrome in whom antimuscarinic drugs are contraindicated [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">NICE, 2013</a>]. <ul><li>The manufacturer of mirabegron conducted two systematic reviews which identified six RCTs and one safety trial. All the trials compared mirabegron with either placebo or tolterodine tartrate, or both, for the management of overactive bladder syndrome. An additional mixed-treatment comparison was performed comparing mirabegron with placebo, tolterodine tartrate, oxybutynin hydrochloride, solifenacin succinate, fesoterodine fumarate, and trospium chloride.<ul><li>The mixed-treatment comparison indicated that mirabegron, as with all antimuscarinic drugs, offers modest improvements compared with placebo however, it was uncertain whether it had equivalent efficacy to the other antimuscarinics.</li><li>The rate of adverse effects were no different between mirabegron and tolterodine tartrate 4 mg however, the nature of the adverse effects differed. For example, dry mouth was more common with tolterodine tartrate than with mirabegron. The appraisal committee concluded that the different adverse effect profile of mirabegron could be of benefit for people who cannot tolerate the specific adverse effects of antimuscarinic drugs, particularly dry mouth.</li><li>The cost effectiveness of mirabegron when compared with other antimuscarinic drugs was uncertain. However, the appraisal committee concluded that mirabegron was likely to be a cost-effective treatment for people with overactive bladder for whom antimuscarinics are contraindicated, ineffective, or not tolerated.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Subsequent systematic reviews showed a similar efficacy of mirabegron to most antimuscarinics and a lower incidence of dry mouth [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">Maman et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">Chen et al, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">Kelleher et al, 2018</a>]. An evidence review by the EAU found that, for the improvement of urge urinary incontinence, mirabegron is better than placebo and as efficacious as antimuscarinics [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">EAU, 2018</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Follow up</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on when to review after starting an antimuscarinic drug are based on expert opinion in national guidance [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>]. <ul><li>The recommendation to review women older than 75 years more frequently than younger women is also supported by a meta-analysis that notes that for older adults with frailty, comorbidities, functional or cognitive deficits, and additional medication are more significant in their management. Higher rates of adverse effects were found with antimuscarinic drugs (53.8%) compared with placebo (41.7%) in older adults [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">Vouri et al, 2017</a>]. </li></ul></li><li>The recommendations on treatment options at review are based on the NICE guideline <em>Urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse in women: management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>] and NICE technology appraisal guidance that recommends mirabegron as an option for treating the symptoms of overactive bladder only if antimuscarinic drugs are contraindicated or clinically ineffective, or have unacceptable side effects [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">NICE, 2013</a>]. The EAU also suggests considering dose escalation, an alternative antimuscarinic, or mirabegron as an option if an antimuscarinic treatment is ineffective [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">EAU, 2018</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Topical oestrogens</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is largely based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline, <em>Urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse in women: management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>].<ul><li>NICE found evidence from short-term studies that the use of intravaginal oestrogens may improve incontinence and frequency in post-menopausal women with vaginal atrophy. There is no evidence of benefit for systemic oestrogens alone in postmenopausal women with urinary incontinence [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>].

The EAU found few studies on the use of desmopressin purely to treat urinary incontinence and no evidence to suggest an effect on nocturnal incontinence, but there is evidence to suggest a reduction in nocturnal polyuria with desmopressin treatment.
