This could include, taking into account their preferences and clinical circumstances for care and treatment, discussing the risks and benefits of these decisions, whilst involving all relevant members of the multidisciplinary team in the decision and recording the reasoning behind each decision.</li></ul><h4>Medicines</h4><ul><li>NICE advises that people should continue taking their medicines (including ACE inhibitors [angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor], angiotensin receptor blockers, immunosuppressants, and diuretics) as normal, unless advised to stop by their healthcare professional. This includes people who have symptoms of COVID‑19.</li><li>For people with CKD and suspected or confirmed COVID‑19, review the use of medicines, taking into account whether any have the potential to adversely affect renal function.</li><li>Prescribe usual quantities of medicines to meet the person's clinical needs.</li></ul><h4>Monitoring CKD</h4><ul><li>NICE advises that renal function should be reassessed in people with CKD who have recovered from COVID‑19. The urgency of reassessment should be based on the person’s premorbid eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate), comorbidities, and their clinical circumstances.</li><li>For people who are stable on treatment, assess whether it is safe to reduce the frequency of routine blood and urine tests during the COVID‑19 pandemic. Take into account any comorbidities and whether their CKD is progressive.</li><li>Encourage self-monitoring and self-management (including blood pressure monitoring) for people who are able to do this. NICE advise that where possible, these people should be offered access to their medical data (including diagnosis, comorbidities, test results, treatments, and correspondence).</li><li>Ensure that people who are self-monitoring or self-managing know when they should seek help and who to contact.</li></ul><h4>Referrals to renal services</h4><ul><li>To minimize risk from COVID‑19, NICE advises that clinicians should delay referral if the clinical need is not urgent, for example, if the person has mild-to-moderate proteinuria and a stable eGFR (including people with suspected inherited kidney disease).</li><li>Continue to refer people for urgent outpatient appointments if there is a clinical need, for example, if the person has accelerated progression of CKD, which is defined as:<ul><li>A sustained decrease in GFR (glomerular filtration rate) of 25% or more and a change in GFR category within 12 months <em>or </em>a sustained decrease in GFR of 15 ml per minute per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> per year.</li><li>Nephrotic syndrome or very severe proteinuria (urinary albumin to creatinine ratio more than 300 mg per mmol).</li><li>A new diagnosis of GFR category G5 (GFR less than 15 ml per minute per 1.73m<sup>2</sup>).</li></ul></li><li>Clinicians should contact their local renal specialist team if there is uncertainty about the need for an urgent outpatient referral.</li></ul><h4>Renal ultrasound</h4><ul><li>To minimize risk from COVID‑19, NICE advises delaying referral for renal ultrasound if the result is unlikely to change management immediately, for example, if the person has:<ul><li>A family history of polycystic kidney disease and needs renal ultrasound to exclude this disease.</li><li>A GFR less than 30 ml per minute per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (GFR category G4 or G5) that has been stable for at least 6 months.</li><li>Been identified by a nephrologist as having a possible need for a non‑urgent renal biopsy.</li></ul></li><li>Continue to refer people for renal ultrasound if the result might immediately change management, for example, if the person has:<ul><li>Accelerated progression of CKD.</li><li>Visible or persistent invisible haematuria.</li><li>Symptoms of urinary tract obstruction.</li><li>Been identified by a nephrologist as needing an urgent renal biopsy.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Hospital admission</h4><ul><li>When deciding whether to refer a person with CKD and COVID‑19 for hospital admission, NICE advises that this discussion with the admitting clinician should take into account:<ul><li>The person's preferences.</li><li>The severity of the CKD and any comorbidities.</li><li>Whether the person is taking immunosuppressants.</li><li>The benefits and risks of admission.</li><li>The care that can be offered in hospital compared with that at home.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 962469d8-ebe1-42f3-9e4f-abbc01058cbc --><!-- end item d3f8d1ac-4192-4bfa-ac44-abbc01058cbb -->","subChapters":[{"id":"060e76b3-aaa9-5c2f-9d0a-cbb88320f851","slug":"basis-for-recommendation-e07","fullItemName":"Basis for recommendation","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 0b61ff03-7ef7-410f-919e-abbc01058cbe --><h4>Basis for recommendation</h4><!-- end field 0b61ff03-7ef7-410f-919e-abbc01058cbe -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item e072a335-3237-47d9-bcb9-abbc01058cbe --><!-- begin field 0a720e9e-f1c4-48be-8d11-abbc01058cbe --><p>These recommendations are based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) <em>COVID-19 rapid guideline: chronic kidney disease</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">NICE, 2020a</a>].</p><ul><li>The recommendation to continue taking medication is derived from the lack of evidence from clinical or epidemiological studies that ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers might worsen COVID‑19, this is based on <em>The Renal Association, UK position statement on COVID-19 and ACE inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker use</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Renal Association, 2020a</a>] and the Renal Association <em>Guidance for clinicians with patients receiving immunosuppression treatment for autoimmune conditions of their native kidneys during COVID-19</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Renal Association, 2020b</a>]. </li><li>The recommendation to provide usual quantities of medications is based on the pragmatic advice that prescribing larger quantities of medicines could put the supply chain at risk. </li></ul><!-- end field 0a720e9e-f1c4-48be-8d11-abbc01058cbe --><!-- end item e072a335-3237-47d9-bcb9-abbc01058cbe -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
