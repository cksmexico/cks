In addition, it can allow for timely preparation for renal replacement therapy in end-stage disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Vassalotti, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Gaitonde, 2017</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to repeat the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) within two weeks is to identify an acute deterioration in renal function, due to acute kidney injury (AKI) following starting a new nephrotoxic drug, for example [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">NICE, 2015a</a>].</li><li>NICE notes that GFR is the best overall measure of kidney function, however measuring GFR directly (for example by measuring a filtration marker such as inulin) is expensive and impractical. Therefore, prediction equations have been developed which combine serum creatinine levels (an endogenous test of kidney function) with age, gender, and ethnicity to give an eGFR result. Serum creatinine levels alone are insensitive for detecting moderate CKD as it is a late marker of disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">NICE, 2015a</a>].</li><li>Creatinine is a by-product of muscle metabolism and an imperfect indicator of renal excretory function, and it is influenced by factors such as muscle mass, age, sex, ethnicity, co-morbidities, trauma, exercise, and protein in the diet [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Fraser, 2016</a>].<ul><li>In people with muscle disease, limb amputation, or malnourishment causing reduced muscle mass, serum creatinine generation may be low, causing overestimation of the GFR. Conversely, in people with increased muscle mass such as bodybuilders, meat-eaters, and those using protein supplements, serum creatinine generation may be high, leading to an underestimation of the GFR [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Webster, 2017</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to avoid eating meat prior to eGFR testing is based on the fact that the cooking process converts creatine in meat to creatinine, which is subsequently absorbed into the bloodstream. Ingestion of cooked meat causes a significant increase in serum creatinine concentration, causing a potential underestimation of GFR [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">NICE, 2015a</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to interpret the eGFR result with caution in people who are pregnant or have oedema is based on the NICE clinical guideline, which notes that serum creatinine concentration and eGFR values are affected by individual patient fluid status [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">NICE, 2015a</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to interpret the eGFR result with caution in people of Asian or Chinese origin is based on the fact eGFR is less well validated in these ethnic groups. It is recommended that the eGFR is multiplied by 1.159 if a person is of African-Caribbean or African ethnicity to correct for differences in muscle mass.</li><li>The NICE clinical guideline on CKD notes that changes of serum creatinine concentration of less than 5% may simply be due to biological and analytical variability [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">NICE, 2015a</a>].</li></ul></li><li>Cystatin C is a further measure of renal function from which eGFR can be derived, which is less influenced by muscle mass and may be more accurate in detecting CKD in people with 'borderline' renal function (eGFR values between 45–59 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup> with no evidence of proteinuria) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">NICE, 2015a</a>]. In addition, the KDIGO CKD Work Group suggest using additional tests (such as cystatin C) for confirmatory testing in specific circumstances when eGFR based on serum creatinine is less accurate [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">KDIGO, 2013</a>]. CKS notes, however, that cystatin C is not routinely available in clinical practice, and its use will depend on local availability in laboratory settings [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Fraser, 2016</a>].</li></ul><h4>Measuring and interpreting urine albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR)</h4><ul><li>Persistent proteinuria is a key marker of renal disease, irrespective of eGFR results, and has implications for CKD prognosis, as significant proteinuria independently predicts CKD progression, end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular risk, and mortality [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Gaitonde, 2017</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to check an early morning urine sample is based on the fact there is a diurnal variation in urine protein loss, with morning urine being most concentrated and therefore protein is more likely to be detected at this time [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">NICE, 2015a</a>]. Conversely, false positive proteinuria (due to the presence of orthostatic proteinuria, which is not clinically significant) is less likely to be detected on a morning urine sample [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">KDIGO, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Gaitonde, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Webster, 2017</a>].</li><li>The recommendations on the need for urine ACR re-testing depending on quantification of proteinuria are based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">NICE, 2015a</a>].<ul><li>Urinary ACR is able to detect low levels of proteinuria, and is a more sensitive and specific marker of CKD than a urinary protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">NICE, 2015a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Vassalotti, 2016</a>]. NICE notes that urine PCR may be used for the quantification and monitoring of high levels of proteinuria, such as a urine ACR result greater than or equal to 70 mg/mmol [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">NICE, 2015a</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The information on the use of urine dipstick testing to detect proteinuria is based on the KDIGO guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">KDIGO, 2013</a>] and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Fraser, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Webster, 2017</a>].<ul><li>Most reagent strips are poor at detecting low-grade, clinically relevant urinary albuminuria, and results may be falsely positive if there is concentrated or highly alkaline urine, or frank haematuria.</li></ul></li><li>The information on causes of transient proteinuria are based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Webster, 2017</a>].</li></ul><h4>Assessing for haematuria</h4><ul><li>The recommendation to assess for haematuria on urine dipstick testing is based on the fact this may be a marker of kidney damage, and if detected, it can help identify the underlying nephrological or urological cause of CKD, such as glomerulonephritis or renal tract calculi, depending on associated clinical features [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">NICE, 2015a</a>]. In addition, a cohort study of adults with CKD found the presence of haematuria (one positive urine dipstick test) was associated with a higher risk of progressive disease, end-stage renal disease, and mortality during the first two years of follow-up [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Orlandi, 2018</a>].</li><li>The recommendation on the management of isolated persistent haematuria with no associated marker of kidney damage is based on the NICE clinical guideline on suspected cancer [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">NICE, 2017b</a>].</li></ul><h4>Confirming a diagnosis of CKD</h4><ul><li>The recommendations on when to confirm a diagnosis of CKD and when to take serum creatinine measurements into account are based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">NICE, 2015a</a>].<ul><li>When assessing the rate of decline in eGFR, the NICE guideline development group agreed that a minimum of 3 measurements in not less than 90 days was required (depending on the initial level of eGFR).</li><li>A GFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2 </sup>is associated with a higher risk of complications of CKD.</li><li>An ACR level of 3 mg/mmol is greater than three times the normal value for young men and women, with associated increased risks of cardiovascular disease, CKD progression, and mortality, irrespective of eGFR result.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation to classify CKD category is based on the NICE clinical guideline, which uses the US 'National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative' (NKF-KDOQI) classification of five CKD stages [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">NICE, 2015a</a>].<ul><li>The NICE guideline development group found evidence from five large high-quality meta-analyses to support the use of the classification. It specifically examined the effect of proteinuria at any given eGFR on adverse outcomes, such as disease progression, end-stage renal disease, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and AKI. It concluded that classifying CKD using a combination of eGFR and urine ACR categories was useful to indicate the risk of adverse outcomes and guide treatment options.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation to arrange annual testing for CKD for people with risk factors if initial results exclude a definite diagnosis of CKD is extrapolated from the opinion and expertise of the NICE guideline development group, which recommends this approach in people taking long-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) who are at risk of developing CKD [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">NICE, 2015a</a>], and it is supported by expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Gaitonde, 2017</a>].</li></ul><h4>Assessing cardiovascular risk factors</h4><ul><li>The recommendation to check blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors to allow risk stratification is based on the fact that a diagnosis of CKD increases the risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Measurement of body mass index (BMI) is also important as malnutrition may complicate advanced CKD [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Gaitonde, 2017</a>].</li></ul><h4>Arranging a renal tract ultrasound</h4><ul><li>The indications for renal tract ultrasound scan are based on the experience and opinion of the NICE guideline development group [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">NICE, 2015a</a>] and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Vassalotti, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Gaitonde, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Webster, 2017</a>].<ul><li>Ultrasound is the first-line imaging study for evaluating people with previously undiagnosed CKD, as it helps distinguish end-stage renal disease from potentially reversible AKI or earlier stages of CKD, by identifying obstructive uropathy, renal scarring, and cystic disease, for example [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">NICE, 2015a</a>].</li><li>Ultrasound scanning cannot exclude the diagnosis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in people under the age of 20 years, and is therefore not recommended in this age-group to detect this condition [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">NICE, 2015a</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 6670e028-f18b-4921-8e16-258ee047dc2a --><!-- end item 388976f8-82c5-4be6-a420-7016461b977b -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
