The recommendation to investigate people with risk factors for CKD is based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">NICE, 2015a</a>] and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Fraser, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Vassalotti, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-kidney-disease/references/\">Webster, 2017</a>].
