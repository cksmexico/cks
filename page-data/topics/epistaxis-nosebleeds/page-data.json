First-aid measures should be used whilst awaiting the ambulance:<ul><li>The person should sit with their upper body tilted forward and their mouth open; the soft part of the nose should be pinched firmly and held for 10–15 minutes.</li></ul></li><li>If the person is haemodynamically stable, epistaxis can usually be managed with first-aid measures. If a posterior bleed is suspected (bleeding is profuse, from both nostrils, and the bleeding site cannot be identified on examination), admission to hospital is recommended.</li><li>If bleeding stops with first aid measures, a topical antiseptic such as Naseptin® (chlorhexidine and neomycin) cream may be applied to prevent re-bleeding. After bleeding has stopped:<ul><li>Self-care advice (for example avoiding nose picking and heavy lifting for 24 hours after bleeding) should be offered.</li><li>The need for referral should be considered, for example if epistaxis occurs in a child younger than 2 years of age (as epistaxis is rare in this age group) or if there is a likely underlying cause for bleeding (for example conditions predisposing to bleeding, such as haemophilia or leukaemia).</li></ul></li><li>If bleeding does not stop after 10–15 minutes of adequate pressure to the nostrils, nasal cautery or nasal packing may be used to stop the bleeding if the appropriate expertise and facilities are available in primary care.
