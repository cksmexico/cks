people who should receive screening for chlamydia is based on expert opinion in the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) <em>2015 UK national guideline for the management of infection with Chlamydia trachomatis</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chlamydia-uncomplicated-genital/references/\">BASHH, 2015</a>], and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guideline <em>Management of genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chlamydia-uncomplicated-genital/references/\">SIGN, 2009</a>].</p><h4>Sexual partners of those with proven or suspected chlamydial infection</h4><ul><li>Testing is recommended because chlamydia infection has a high frequency of transmission, with reported partner concordance rates of up to 75% [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chlamydia-uncomplicated-genital/references/\">BASHH, 2015</a>].</li></ul><h4>All sexually active people younger than 25 years of age</h4><ul><li>Annual screening is recommended because the highest prevalence rates are consistently reported in this age group [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chlamydia-uncomplicated-genital/references/\">BASHH, 2015</a>].</li></ul><h4>People under the age of 25 years who have been treated for chlamydia in the previous 3 months</h4><ul><li>Testing is recommended as adults under 25 years of age who test positive for chlamydia are 2–6 times more likely to have a subsequent positive test, and repeated chlamydia infection is associated with an increased risk of complications [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chlamydia-uncomplicated-genital/references/\">BASHH, 2015</a>].</li></ul><h4>People who have had two or more sexual partners in the previous 12 months</h4><ul><li>Testing is recommended as this has been shown to be a risk factor associated with a chlamydia infection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chlamydia-uncomplicated-genital/references/\">SIGN, 2009</a>].</li></ul><h4>All women seeking termination of pregnancy (TOP)</h4><ul><li>Women undergoing TOP are at risk of ascending chlamydial infection and so screening prior to TOP is recommended [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chlamydia-uncomplicated-genital/references/\">SIGN, 2009</a>].</li></ul><h4>All men and women attending genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinics</h4><ul><li>Testing is recommended because GUM clinic attendees have the highest prevalence of infection among any group of patients in healthcare settings [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chlamydia-uncomplicated-genital/references/\">SIGN, 2009</a>].</li></ul><!-- end
