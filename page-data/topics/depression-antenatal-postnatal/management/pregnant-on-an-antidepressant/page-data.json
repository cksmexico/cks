National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) that advises considering seeking advice, preferably from a specialist perinatal mental health service, when more detailed advice about risks of mental health problems or the benefits and harms of treatment in pregnancy is needed, or when psychotropic medication is started in pregnancy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>]. It is also extrapolated from an evidence review commissioned by NICE that noted that considerable caution should be used when changing or stopping antidepressant drugs in pregnancy and the postnatal period [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2014</a>].</li><li>Seeking specialist advice is also recommended due to the uncertainty regarding the benefits, risks and potential harms of mental health treatments in pregnancy and the postnatal period [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2014</a>], the fact that the UK Teratology Information Service (UKTIS) does not make specific recommendations on the 'safest' antidepressants in pregnancy, the fact that there are no antidepressants licensed for use during pregnancy (although the use of antidepressants during pregnancy is common) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2014</a>] and the opinion of the NICE guideline development group that specialist knowledge is required when assessing the trade-off of the benefits and harms of psychotropic medication for mental health problems in pregnancy and the postnatal period [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2014</a>].</li></ul><h5>Decision making</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the NICE <em>Antenatal and postnatal mental health: clinical management and service guideline </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>]<strong> </strong>and the expert opinion of the NICE guideline development group, which advocated women being actively involved in decisions about their care [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2014</a>]. The list of information to take into account also includes advice from a British Association for Psychopharmacology consensus guidance [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">McAllister-Williams et al, 2017</a>] and Canadian best practice guidelines for mental health disorders in the perinatal period [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">BC Reproductive Mental Health Program, 2014</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Areas for discussion</h5><ul><li>This recommendation largely reflects the NICE <em>Antenatal and postnatal mental health: clinical management and service guideline,</em> including the treatment options available to women and specific discussion points associated with them [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>]. The National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health states that, for women with depression in pregnancy or the postnatal period, there should be a discussion about treatment options, including benefits and harms, and the potential consequences of abruptly stopping or changing drug treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2014</a>]. <ul><li><strong>The woman's preferences regarding breastfeeding</strong> — women being prescribed an antidepressant in pregnancy are likely to need to continue treatment in the postpartum period as well. Therefore, it seems sensible to consider the woman's desire to breastfeed at this stage, to avoid the need to consider switching antidepressants later [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">SIGN, 2012</a>].  </li><li><strong>Risks of abrupt withdrawal of antidepressants </strong>— the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) advises that abrupt discontinuation of antidepressant treatment in women with serious mental illness who are at high risk of relapse is unwise, as relapse may ultimately be more harmful to the mother and child than continued drug treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">SIGN, 2012</a>]. NICE also emphasises the importance of not stopping medication without professional advice because of the risk of triggering or exacerbating an episode [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>]. This is consistent with advice from a British Association for Psychopharmacology consensus guidance which discusses avoidance of suddenly stopping antidepressants on discovering a pregnancy because of the risk of discontinuation syndrome and relapse. Suddenly stopping medication when a woman finds out she is pregnant may not remove the risk of malformations [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">McAllister-Williams et al, 2017</a>].  </li><li><strong>Risks of not treating depression</strong> — there is some evidence to suggest an increased risk of adverse outcomes for women with severe depression and their babies, including low birthweight, prematurity, sudden infant death syndrome, and self harm [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2014</a>]. <strong> </strong></li><li><strong>Risks associated with any pregnancy</strong> — the information about the background risk of fetal malformations for pregnant women without a mental disorder is based on information from the UK Teratology Information Service [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">UKTIS, 2013</a>]. </li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 398203f9-4119-4764-96ad-ddd2f1bda5dc --><!-- end item 6d594605-a1a3-4893-946a-b7d7d2a8749e -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"b07c7426-307f-59df-9109-dbf324168693","slug":"managing-a-woman-on-treatment-who-becomes-pregnant","fullItemName":"Managing a woman on treatment who becomes pregnant","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 86358686-72d3-4971-99d4-a76f00bd9e54 --><h3>How should I manage a woman being treated for depression who becomes pregnant?</h3><!-- end field 86358686-72d3-4971-99d4-a76f00bd9e54 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 0180623c-c015-4a33-9f3d-a76f00bd9c5f --><!-- begin field c31b7e42-83e1-4441-8348-a76f00bd9e54 --><p><strong>Before discussing the benefits and harms of treatment, or starting, stopping or switching antidepressant treatment during pregnancy, seek advice, ideally from a specialist perinatal mental health team, where available; or from a secondary mental health service; or the UK Teratology Information Service (UKTIS) on 0344 892 0909.
