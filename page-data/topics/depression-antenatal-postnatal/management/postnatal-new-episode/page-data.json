the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) that advises considering seeking advice, preferably from a specialist perinatal mental health service, when more detailed advice about risks of mental health problems or the benefits and harms of treatment is needed, or when psychotropic medication is started in the postnatal period [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>]. It is also extrapolated from an evidence review commissioned by NICE that noted that considerable caution should be used when changing or stopping antidepressant drugs in pregnancy and the postnatal period [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2014</a>].</p></li><li><p>When considering the risk and benefit of antidepressant treatment for women considering breastfeeding, NICE also recommends taking into account the benefits of breastfeeding, uncertainty of the safety of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and (serotonin-) noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors [(S)NRIs] while breastfeeding, and the risks of stopping a previously effective medication, and advises seeking specialist advice for a breastfeeding woman if there is uncertainty about specific drugs [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>]. The NICE guideline development group was of the opinion that specialist knowledge is required when assessing the trade-off of the benefits and harms of psychotropic medication for mental

guideline </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>]<strong> </strong>and the expert opinion of the NICE guideline development group, which advocated women being actively involved in decisions about their care [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2014</a>]. The list of information to take into account also includes advice from a British

2017</a>] and Canadian best practice guidelines for mental health disorders in the perinatal period [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\"

them [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>]. The National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health states that, for women with depression in pregnancy or the postnatal period, there should be a discussion about treatment options, including benefits and harms, and the potential consequences of abruptly stopping or changing drug treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2014</a>].    <ul><li><strong>Risks of abrupt withdrawal of antidepressants </strong>— the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) advises that abrupt discontinuation of antidepressant treatment in women with serious mental illness who are at high risk of relapse is unwise, as relapse may ultimately be more harmful to the mother and child than continued drug treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">SIGN, 2012</a>]. NICE also emphasises the importance of not stopping medication without professional advice because of the risk of triggering or exacerbating an episode [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>]. </li><li><strong>Risks of not treating depression</strong> — there is some evidence to suggest an increased risk of adverse outcomes for women with severe depression and their babies, including sudden infant death syndrome, and self harm [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2014</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field ca9c2957-154f-487f-9877-a76c00f4c68d --><!-- end item 93de0019-b992-43cf-a665-a76c00f4c68d -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"1075ee2d-7fac-5d4b-89fe-124720daf2cc","slug":"managing-a-new-episode-in-the-postnatal-period","fullItemName":"Managing a new episode in the postnatal period","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field f1c97e2f-8a33-4125-8d20-a770009cdb7c --><h3>How should I manage a new episode of depression in the postnatal period?</h3><!-- end field f1c97e2f-8a33-4125-8d20-a770009cdb7c -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item d56d793f-4292-4547-b88e-a770009cd929 --><!-- begin field ac521214-fc12-48c9-a838-a770009cdb7c --><p><strong>Before discussing the benefits and harms of treatment or starting, stopping, or switching antidepressant treatment for a postnatal woman, seek advice, ideally from a specialist perinatal mental health team, where available; or from secondary psychiatric care.

When making its recommendations for women with varying severities of depression in pregnancy and the postnatal period, the NICE guideline development group (GDG) considered the evidence for the clinical and cost-effectiveness of facilitated self help and structured psychological interventions for the treatment of depression in non-pregnant women and also took into account the findings of an evidence review [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2014</a>]:   <ul><li>Up to three studies (n = 1136) showed moderate clinical benefits of facilitated self help on the symptoms of depression compared with usual treatment in women with subthreshold to moderate symptoms of depression in pregnancy or the postnatal period (very low to high quality evidence).</li><li>Up to ten studies showed large to moderate benefits with structured psychological interventions (CBT or IPT) in terms of depression diagnosis and symptoms (very low to high quality evidence), in addition to continued moderate to large effects in the short and intermediate term (low quality evidence).</li><li>One study showed a large effect of structured psychological interventions on anxiety symptoms in women with depression (low quality evidence).</li></ul></li><li>For persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms, or mild to moderate depression, the GDG recommended considering facilitated self help and that its delivery should include written materials, support by a trained practitioner face-to-face or by telephone, and take place in usually six to eight sessions over a nine to twelve week period [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2014</a>].</li><li>For moderate to severe depression in pregnancy or the postnatal period, the GDG advised offering options in line with existing NICE guidance (taking into account the higher threshold for pharmcological treatment in pregnancy or breastfeeding), including structured psychological interventions (CBT or IPT) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2014</a>].</li><li>A subsequent meta-analysis on the effectiveness of psychological interventions for postnatal depression in primary care included trials on CBT, IPT, counselling and support groups and found that psychological interventions produced lower levels of symptoms of depression in the longer term compared with control, (although the mean attrition rate was 23%) and higher levels of remission immediately following treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">Stephens et al, 2016</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Efficacy of pharmacological treatment in pregnancy and the postnatal period</h5><ul><li>There is good evidence of efficacy for pharmacological treatments for depression in the general population (see the NICE guideline <em>Depression: the treatment and management of depression in adults</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">NICE, 2009</a>] for more information).
