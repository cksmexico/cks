A new section on prognosis has been added. There have been no major changes to recommendations, however, assessment, diagnostic, and management recommendations have been updated in line with the NICE <em>Antenatal and postnatal mental health: clinical management and service guidance </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>]. Detail on the risks of individual antidepressants in pregnancy and breastfeeding has been removed and links to specialist sources of information included. Prescribing information specifically relevant to antidepressants in the antenatal and postnatal period is now included in the management scenarios.

A literature search was conducted in December 2012 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key RCTs published since the last revision of the topic. Due to conflicting data on the safety of antidepressants during pregnancy, CKS no longer make specific recommendations on antidepressant choices during pregnancy. CKS now recommends that specialist advice should be sought before starting antidepressant treatment in a woman with a new episode of antenatal depression, and before stopping or switching antidepressant in a woman who becomes pregnant whilst taking an antidepressant. No major changes have been made to the recommendations for managing breastfeeding women with postnatal depression; however, it is also recommended that the prescriber considers seeking specialist advice if considering antidepressant treatment for this group of women.</p><p><strong>October 2012 </strong>— minor update.
