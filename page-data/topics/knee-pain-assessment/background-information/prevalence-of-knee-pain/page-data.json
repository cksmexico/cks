In people 75 years of age or older, the prevalence in women was 36% and in men was 27%.</li><li>The prevalence of knee pain with disability was 6%, and the prevalence of moderate or severe knee pain was 12%.</li><li>It was estimated (from a survey of a subset of initial responders) that 13% of people had consulted their GP for knee pain.</li></ul></li><li>In 1 year, 3% of people registered with a GP in the UK consult their GP for a knee problem.

The prevalence rates were 13–28%, with the variation being explained by differences in case definitions, study group composition, and survey methods [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/knee-pain-assessment/references/\">Peat et al, 2001</a>].</li><li>In one subsequent large community survey (with 6792 respondents), 47% of people older than 50 years of age reported knee pain in the previous 12 months, and of these a third had consulted their GP for knee pain in the same period [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/knee-pain-assessment/references/\">Jinks et al, 2004</a>].</li></ul></li><li><strong>Prevalence of knee pain in children</strong><ul><li>One community survey of 1756 pre-adolescent schoolchildren (8–13 years of age) in Finland found the prevalence of knee pain occurring at least once a week was 12% [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/knee-pain-assessment/references/\">El-Metwally et al, 2006</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 784a2d2b-1fda-44a5-b6b5-8de98ef4e047 --><!-- end item ceeb97ab-6b35-495f-89a7-dd556c11b8bf -->","topic":{"id":"84961219-d5cb-56f0-9720-29d4d2e0498a","topicId":"a886232a-01dd-4812-8102-1442093b822a","topicName":"Knee pain -
