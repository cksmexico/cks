Investigations which may be arranged by the specialist include:<ul><li>Neuroimaging — MRI scanning is the standard imaging tool to identify lesions such as small tumours, vascular malformations, and cortical dysplasia that are not detected by CT [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">Krishnamurthy, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">SIGN, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">Thijs et al, 2019</a>].  </li><li>Electroencephalography (EEG) — helpful in determining the likely seizure type and the likely risk of seizure recurrence [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">Gavvala and Schuele, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">Thijs et al, 2019</a>], although it cannot exclude a diagnosis of epilepsy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">SIGN, 2018</a>]. </li></ul></li></ul><h5>Advice to family or carers</h5><ul><li>Advising the family or carers on how to recognize and manage a seizure is extrapolated from a checklist of information patients and carers may find helpful in the SIGN guideline <em>Diagnosis and management of epilepsy in adults</em><em><strong> </strong></em>that highlights the importance of advising on general first aid guidelines and when to call an ambulance [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">SIGN, 2018</a>].<ul><li>The risk of a subsequent seizure is at its greatest shortly after the first seizure, with 60–70% of seizure recurrences occurring within the first 6 months [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">Legg and Newton, 2017, Counselling adults who experience a first seizure</a>].  </li></ul></li><li>The recommendation to record any further episodes of possible seizures is based on expert opinion in the NICE guideline <em>The Epilepsies.
