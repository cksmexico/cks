Major malformations most commonly associated with antiepileptic drugs are neural tube defects, cardiovascular defects, oral clefts, and urinary tract defects. The prevalence of congenital abnormalities increases with increasing numbers of antiepileptic drugs taken and is particularly high for sodium valproate compared with other antiepileptic drugs [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">SIGN, 2018</a>].</li></ul></li><li>An update to the NICE guideline advises discussing with women and girls of childbearing potential (including young girls who are likely to need treatment into their childbearing years), and their parents and/or carers if appropriate, the risk of antiepileptic drugs causing malformations and possible neurodevelopmental impairments in an unborn child, and assessing the risks and benefits of treatment with individual drugs [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">NICE, 2020</a>]. </li><li>The information about the risks of inheriting epilepsy is based on the NICE guidance [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012b</a>], and evidence quoted in the SIGN guideline, which states that chromosomal and single gene disorders causing epilepsy are rare, but the risks of having a child with epilepsy are higher for mothers with genetic, compared with symptomatic, epilepsies [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">SIGN, 2018</a>].  </li></ul><h5>Advice about valproate</h5><ul><li>The recommendation on discussing the risks of taking valproate during pregnancy is based on a 2018 update to the NICE guideline <em>The Epilepsies. The diagnosis and management of the epilepsies in adults and children in primary and secondary care </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012b</a>] and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advice on the contraindications of valproate medications in women and girls of childbearing potential unless conditions of the pregnancy prevention programme are met [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">MHRA, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">MHRA, 2019a</a>]. </li><li>An update to the NICE guideline advises specifically discussing the risk of continued use of sodium valproate to the unborn child in women and girls of childbearing potential and<strong> </strong>being aware that higher doses of sodium valproate (more than 800 mg/day) and polytherapy, particularly with sodium valproate, are associated with greater risk [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">NICE, 2020</a>]. </li><li>Sodium valproate is associated with an increased rate of teratogenicity compared to other antiepileptic drugs [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">SIGN, 2018</a>]. There is no safe dose of valproate in pregnancy and risks include [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">MHRA, 2019b</a>]: <ul><li>Around 1 in 10 babies exposed to valproate in pregnancy are born with a congenital malformation, compared with 2–3% of the general population.</li><li>Around 3 to 4 children exposed to valporate in pregnancy show signs of developmental delay (for example late talking and walking, lower intellectual ability, reduced language skills, and problems with memory.</li><li>Children exposed to valproate in pregnancy have an increased risk of autistic spectrum disorder and childhood autism and may be at increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Referral for specialist pre-conceptual counselling</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to refer women with epilepsy for specialist pre-conceptual counselling is based on:<ul><li>SIGN advice that, if appropriate, women with epilepsy should have their diagnosis and treatment reviewed by specialist services <em>before</em> conception; women with epilepsy should receive pre-pregnancy counselling regularly (especially if taking antiepileptic drug treatment); and that women with epilepsy should be given advice on continuing antiepileptic drug treatment during pregnancy at the recommended doses to avoid poor adherence during pregnancy causing problems with seizures [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">SIGN, 2018</a>]. </li><li>NICE recommendations offering referral for specialist pre-conceptual counselling for all women taking antiepileptic drugs to discuss the risks and benefits of continuing, adjusting, or stopping treatment before becoming pregnant based on evidence from systematic reviews and the consensus opinion of its guideline development group [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012b</a>]. </li><li>Advice from the RCOG that a clinician competent in the management of epilepsy should have responsibility for discussing choice and dose of antiepileptic drugs and the associated risks to the fetus and seizure control. Specialists can make adjustments to medication before the woman becomes pregnant [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">RCOG, 2016</a>]. </li></ul></li><li>Specialist referral is also important because good seizure control during pregnancy is more likely if a woman's seizures are controlled before conception [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">SIGN, 2018</a>]. Another important factor influencing the decision to refer for specialist preconceptual counselling is that risk perception is likely to affect adherence to epilepsy treatment in pregnancy, and women with epilepsy tend to overestimate the risks<strong> </strong>of antiepileptic drugs at this time [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">SIGN, 2018</a>]. </li><li>CKS recommends advising the woman with epilepsy to continue her antiepileptic drugs if she becomes pregnant unexpectedly in line with RCOG advice that antiepileptic drugs should not be stopped or altered without discussion in this situation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">RCOG, 2016</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Prescribing high-dose folic acid before pregnancy</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to prescribe high-dose daily folic acid is based on guidance from the RCOG which advises 5 mg of folic acid before conception and until the end of the first trimester in all women with epilepsy with the aim of reducing the risk of major congenital malformation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">RCOG, 2016</a>].  </li><li>SIGN advice is largely in line with this, although SIGN recommends a 400 micrograms daily dose for women not taking an antiepileptic drug, unless they have a body mass index of more than 30, a previous child with a neural tube defect, or family history of neural tube defect [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">SIGN, 2018</a>]. NICE recommends that all women and girls on antiepileptic drugs should be offered 5 mg per day of folic acid before any possibility of pregnancy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2012b</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Consider offering written information</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on a review article on epilepsy in pregnancy that discusses the lack of information provision reported by some women and its potential impact on decision making.
