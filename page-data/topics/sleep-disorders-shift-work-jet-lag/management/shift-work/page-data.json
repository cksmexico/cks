It improved several aspects of cognitive performance, such as orientation, attention, memory, and reasoning during work shifts, and significantly reduced errors when compared with placebo. It was uncertain, however, the extent to which these findings are generalisable to real shift work and worker safety, and there was a high risk of bias in all studies due to selective outcome reporting [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Ker et al, 2010</a>].</li><li>A further Cochrane systematic review found one RCT on the use of caffeine plus pre-night shift naps, which cites limited evidence that it reduced participant sleepiness and increased alertness during the shift [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Liira, 2014</a>].</li><li>An additional systematic review and meta-analysis of eight studies of the effects of caffeine in emergency clinicians found low- to moderate-quality evidence from four studies which showed caffeine improved psychomotor vigilance and performance, and lessened the slowing of reaction time at the end of shifts. In contrast, two studies found that caffeine reduced sleep quality and duration. It notes that long-term caffeine use can result in tolerance, and concludes that the risk-benefit ratio of long-term caffeine use in shift workers is not known [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Temple, 2018</a>].</li><li>This approach is supported by the US publication on fatigue management which found low-quality evidence to recommend caffeine as a countermeasure to fatigue [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Patterson, 2018</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in review articles highlights that caffeine is a commonly used stimulant which may act as a countermeasure to fatigue and sleepiness, to improve alertness and cognitive performance at work during periods of prolonged wakefulness [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Kecklund, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Richter, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Advice on optimal working schedules and work environment</h5><ul><li>Organisational strategies such as improved scheduling of shifts may reduce the risk of complications of shift work. Expert opinion in a review article recommends avoiding short recovery times between shifts, avoiding long shifts and work weeks, recommends morning shifts starting at 7am if possible, and states the benefits of forward rotation of shifts [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Kecklund, 2016</a>]. A further review article states that circadian adaptation is not possible during short-term rotating shift work [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">McKenna, 2018</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article notes that occupational health departments can liaise with employers and help to screen for sleep disorders [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Kecklund, 2016</a>]. The recommendation to consider occupational health team involvement is also pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li><li>The recommendations on taking regular breaks and napping during a shift are based on limited evidence from a Cochrane systematic review of non-pharmacological interventions to reduce the impact of shift work [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Slanger, 2016</a>], a systematic review of scheduled napping in emergency workers [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Martin-Gill, 2018</a>], a US publication on fatigue management [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Patterson, 2018</a>], and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Kecklund, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Richter, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">McKenna, 2018</a>].<ul><li>A Cochrane systematic review identified four RCTs of the effect of napping during night shift, and found very low-quality evidence of a reduction in mean reaction time following a single nap opportunity.

Napping did, however, have a moderate, significant effect on sleepiness and fatigue measured at the end of shift. The authors noted, however, that the evidence was of very low quality for all outcomes, with mixed or inconclusive findings in some studies, and methodological limitations included variable nap times, risk of bias due to crossover studies, lack of blinding, and small study sample sizes [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Martin-Gill, 2018</a>].</li><li>A US publication on fatigue management found very low-quality evidence to recommend napping during shifts to reduce fatigue [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Patterson, 2018</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in review articles suggest these strategies reduce sleepiness and reaction times and improve performance, but naps may not be feasible in certain work situations, and may result in sleep inertia [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Wright Jr et al, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Kecklund, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Richter, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">McKenna, 2018</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation on bright light exposure during shifts is based on a Cochrane systematic review of non-pharmacological interventions to reduce the impact of shift work [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Slanger, 2016</a>], a randomized crossover trial [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Griepentrog, 2018</a>], the AASM publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Morgenthaler, 2015</a>], and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Kecklund, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Richter, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">McKenna, 2018</a>].<ul><li>A Cochrane systematic review identified 10 RCTs of the effect of bright light during work shifts and found low-quality evidence that sleepiness scores were reduced in one study, but there was no significant change in another study. Bright light during the night plus sunglasses at dawn in one small study (n = 17) found very low-quality evidence that this intervention did not significantly influence sleepiness or reaction times compared to normal light. It was also unclear whether the small sleepiness reduction in one study was a clinically significant outcome in a real work situation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Slanger, 2016</a>].</li><li>A single-centre randomized crossover trial of the effect of 10 hours of bright light compared with standard hospital lighting on nurses working night shift on an intensive care unit (43 matched pairs) found mixed results. The treatment group had reduced subjective sleepiness scores, however they displayed reduced psychomotor performance. There was no significant effect on other parameters such as lapses and response times.

It found moderate-quality evidence from three RCTs that stimulant medications such as modafinil are effective in reducing sleepiness during night shift and increasing alertness, compared with placebo. It noted, however, that modafinil has been associated with severe skin reactions and other neuropsychiatric adverse effects, and has an uncertain long-term safety profile [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Liira, 2014</a>].</li><li>The AASM publication found mixed results from two good-quality simulation studies and five mixed-quality field studies for melatonin given prior to daytime sleep after night shift work. It improved daytime sleep quality and duration, caused a shift in circadian phase in some but not all study participants, but failed to improve alertness at night compared with placebo. Variability in shift schedules, melatonin dosage and timing in different studies were noted as potential limitations. It found evidence from three studies suggesting that modafinil can improve night-time alertness in shift workers [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Morgenthaler, 2015</a>].</li><li>A small Iranian randomized, double-blind crossover trial comparing melatonin drug treatment with placebo for emergency clinicians working night shift (n = 24) found limited evidence for the use of melatonin.
