It notes, however, that this regime may be associated with increased sleep disturbance and recovery time following the return flight, and may be difficult to maintain in practice [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Morgenthaler, 2015</a>].<ul><li>It identified one crossover study that found after a 9-hour westward flight, the participants who kept their home-based sleep hours had less sleepiness and symptoms of jet lag compared with the group that adopted the destination time. However, one-third of the study population reported they would prefer to adopt the destination sleep times in order to participate fully in local activities.</li></ul></li><li>This approach is supported by expert opinion in a review article that for short stopovers, the aim is to preserve sleep and alertness without necessarily modifying the circadian system [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Arendt, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Advice for longer stay travel</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to maximize sleep prior to travel and minimize residual 'sleep debt' is based on the fact that sleep deprivation during travel may contribute to jet lag symptoms [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Bin, 2019</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to shift pre-flight bedtimes to be in line with those at the destination are based on limited evidence in review articles that sleep and light treatment on a shifting schedule pre-flight can help rapid adaptation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Arendt, 2018</a>]. A review of non-pharmacological interventions for jet lag notes that shifting sleep schedules prior to travel is a common strategy, but found no evidence for impact on jet lag symptoms [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Bin, 2019</a>].</li><li>The AASM publication did not find any studies where adjusting sleep schedule was the only intervention to improve jet lag symptoms [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Morgenthaler, 2015</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article also recommends encouraging napping and attempting to follow the destination sleep schedule prior to travel [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Weingarten, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h5>Advice on in-flight travel strategies</h5><ul><li>The recommendations to maintain hydration and avoid alcohol during travel are based on expert opinion in a review article, as alcohol can increase urine output and dehydration and can impair the quality of sleep [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Weingarten, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h5>Advice on strategies at the destination</h5><ul><li>A review article of 13 studies (n = 392) investigating various non-pharmacological interventions for jet lag including light exposure, sleep scheduling, physical activity, and meal timing and diet changes, found no significant impact of jet lag outcomes for nine studies, mixed findings in three studies, and one observational study reported a benefit of dietary changes prior to travel (but this was not randomized and was subject to confounding factors). It concluded that there is limited evidence for the effectiveness of interventions for jet lag due to the low- to moderate-quality of included studies, with a high risk of selection bias, small number of studies, and lack of blinding [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Bin, 2019</a>].<ul><li>Nine studies examined the effect of light exposure on jet lag symptoms. It theorized that appropriately-timed, scheduled bright light and darkness can facilitate the shift of circadian rhythms and sleep/wake cycles to a new time zone, with subsequent improvement in alertness. Only two very small studies showed a beneficial impact of light on sleep efficiency and psychomotor performance, and they were underpowered to detect statistically significant results. Additional limitations may have been inefficient timing of light exposure, lack of control over ambient light (which can counteract the light intervention), and large individual variability in circadian phase. The authors propose that appropriate light exposure and avoidance before and during the flight as well as at the destination could reduce the degree of circadian misalignment and the time required for adaptation to a new time zone.</li><li>Two observational studies found little evidence that physical activity before or after travel improves jet lag symptoms, but the authors highlighted possible confounding factors between the self-selected exercise and control groups, which make the results difficult to interpret.</li><li>It found no strong evidence that meal timing or diet changes have an impact on jet lag symptoms, but suggested it may be an area that would benefit from further study.</li></ul></li><li>These limited findings on the impact of supplementary light treatment are supported by a small RCT (n = 22) of professional athletes which found no clinically relevant effects of light treatment for jeg lag symptoms following eastwards travel from the USA to Europe. The study also noted large differences in the perception of jet lag symptoms between study participants [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Thompson, 2013</a>].</li><li>The specific recommendations on scheduled light and dark exposure for east- and westwards travel and sunglasses use are based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Weingarten, 2013</a>]. This is supported by another review article which recommends avoidance of light at critical times, for example by using light-blocking glasses [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Arendt, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Advice on measures to promote sleep</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on strategies to promote sleep at the destination are largely extrapolated from studies on the effect of shift work on sleep. This approach is also supported by the expert opinion of previous external reviewers of this CKS topic.<ul><li>The recommendations on creating an optimal sleeping environment are based on expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Wright Jr et al, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">McKenna, 2018</a>].</li><li>The recommendations on meal timing are based on expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Kecklund, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">McKenna, 2018</a>].</li><li>The recommendations on physical activity are based on expert opinion in review articles that regular exercise can improve sleep quantity and quality, but it may affect sleep if performed too close to anticipated sleep time [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Wright Jr et al, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Kecklund, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Richter, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">McKenna, 2018</a>].</li><li>The recommendations on avoiding stimulants such as caffeine and nicotine, and alcohol close to anticipated sleep time is based on expert opinion in review articles. Caffeine in particular has a peak onset of action 20–45 minutes after consumption, and its effects last 3–5 hours [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Kecklund, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">McKenna, 2018</a>].</li><li>The recommendation on a regular routine and relaxation techniques prior to anticipated sleep time is based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">McKenna, 2018</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Advice on the use of caffeine</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to consider the use of caffeine to counteract sleepiness associated with jet lag is extrapolated from a Cochrane systematic review of 12 RCTs on caffeine use in shift workers which also studied the effects of caffeine in people with jet lag [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Ker et al, 2010</a>].<ul><li>It found caffeine improved several aspects of cognitive performance, such as orientation, attention, and reasoning during jet lag, when compared with placebo.</li></ul></li><li>This strategy is supported by the AASM publication which analyzed two small double-blind trials of moderate quality that investigated the use of slow-release caffeine compared with placebo or melatonin to counteract sleepiness due to jet lag. It found caffeine is an option to treat excessive daytime sleepiness but noted it may disrupt night-time sleep. Information was lacking on the effects of caffeine on other daytime symptoms of jet lag [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Morgenthaler, 2015</a>]. </li><li>Expert opinion in review articles also suggests considering caffeine use early in the day to help counteract daytime sleepiness [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Weingarten, 2013</a>]. Caffeine improves alertness and performance, such as reaction time, vigilance, and reasoning, and is generally used to maintain daytime alertness in the new time zone [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Arendt, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Managing stressors contributing to travel fatigue</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to reduce environmental and individual stressors before, during, and after travel to help reduce travel fatigue associated with jet lag is based on expert opinion in a systematic review of non-pharmacological interventions for jet lag [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Bin, 2019</a>].</li><li>In addition, expert opinion in a review article states that eating at the conventional time at the destination may help adaptation to the new time zone [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Arendt, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Considering short-term hypnotic drug treatment</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to consider the short-term use of a hypnotic drug for sleep disturbance associated with jet lag is based on limited evidence of benefit and potential risks of treatment.<ul><li>The ASSM publication recommends the short-term use of a hypnotic drug for the treatment of jet lag-induced sleep disturbance and insomnia based on an evaluation of nine studies (including three high-quality RCTs), but highlights the risks of adverse effects such as global amnesia, and states that the effects on daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder are unproven and have not been adequately studied [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Morgenthaler, 2015</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article suggests that hypnotics may provide short-term alleviation of sleep problems and may speed up adaptation to the destination time zone, but drug treatment does not address the underlying lack of synchrony between the 'internal clock' and local time cues. They may also have a role in short stopovers when adaptation to the new time zone is not wanted. The review highlights potential problems with adverse effects and risks of dependency [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">Arendt, 2018</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Melatonin drug treatment not recommended</h5><ul><li>Sleep-promoting drugs such as melatonin are licensed in the UK for short-term management of jet lag disorder [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sleep-disorders-shift-work-jet-lag/references/\">BNF 76, 2018</a>], however CKS has not recommended their use in primary care as there is limited and conflicting evidence of benefit.<ul><li>A Cochrane systematic review of nine randomized trials assessed the effects of melatonin on various subjective jet lag symptoms compared with placebo.
