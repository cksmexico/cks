The Cochrane authors reported no data in relation to their agreed outcomes but noted that nearly half of the women in the placebo and antacid group discontinued the study drug because of inadequate symptom relief, compared with no discontinuations in the ranitidine and antacid group [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-pregnancy-associated/references/\">Phupong and Hanprasertpong, 2015</a>].</li><li>A small, double-blind crossover RCT (18 women at 29 or 31 weeks' gestation) compared ranitidine 150 mg twice daily or once daily with placebo. It found that only the twice daily regimen significantly reduced symptoms of heartburn compared with placebo (mean reduction of 44%, 95% CI 15 to 73). Adverse fetal outcomes were not reported [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-pregnancy-associated/references/\">Larson et al, 1997</a>]<strong>. </strong>This study was not included in the Cochrane systematic review because of its crossover design [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-pregnancy-associated/references/\">Phupong and Hanprasertpong, 2015</a>].</li></ul></li><li>A review by the UK Teratology Information Service (UKTIS) found data for over 1500 pregnancy exposures to ranitidine (more than for other individual H2-receptor antagonists). An overall increased risk was not found for congenital malformations, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine death, low birth weight, preterm delivery, neonatal complications, or adverse neuro-developmental outcomes, either for H2-receptor antagonists as a class or for ranitidine [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-pregnancy-associated/references/\">UKTIS, 2015b</a>].</li></ul><h5>Omeprazole</h5><ul><li>The recommendation that omeprazole is an option as an acid-suppressing drug if symptoms are severe or persist despite treatment with an antacid or alginate is based on World Gastroenterology Organisation global guidelines: <em>Global perspective on gastroesophageal reflux disease </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-pregnancy-associated/references/\">World Gastroenterology Organisation, 2015</a>], and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-pregnancy-associated/references/\">UKMi, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-pregnancy-associated/references/\">van der Woude et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-pregnancy-associated/references/\">Body and Christie, 2016</a>], and the British National Formulary [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-pregnancy-associated/references/\">BNF 72, 2016</a>]. </li><li>CKS did not find any controlled studies on the effectiveness of omeprazole in pregnant women with dyspepsia, and the authors of a Cochrane systematic review noted the need for future research on the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for the treatment of heartburn in pregnancy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-pregnancy-associated/references/\">Phupong and Hanprasertpong, 2015</a>]. However, trials of omeprazole in the general population, where it is known to be more effective than ranitidine [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-pregnancy-associated/references/\">Christopher, 2005</a>], coupled with a large amount of anecdotal evidence, can reasonably be extrapolated to suggest that it is an effective treatment in pregnancy.</li><li>Of all the PPIs, omeprazole has more data to support its safety profile [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-pregnancy-associated/references/\">UKMi, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-pregnancy-associated/references/\">UKTIS, 2015a</a>].<ul><li>CKS found no controlled trials addressing the safety of omeprazole in pregnancy. </li><li>A review by UKTIS found no evidence that first-trimester exposure to PPIs as a group, or specifically omeprazole, increases the overall risk of congenital malformation, or the risk of specific malformations. The risk of preterm delivery or low birth weight in the infant does not appear to be increased by PPIs as a group or omeprazole. However, data are insufficient to ascertain whether the risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes are increased by PPI use in pregnancy. UKTIS found conflicting evidence on the effect of gastric acid suppression during pregnancy on the risk of atopy in childhood, but was unable to draw conclusions from this [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-pregnancy-associated/references/\">UKTIS, 2015a</a>].</li><li>A review by UK Medicines Information (UKMi) noted the findings of a meta-analysis of seven cohort studies (n = 1530 exposed pregnancies) which concluded that first-trimester use of PPIs, and omeprazole individually is not an important teratogenic risk [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-pregnancy-associated/references/\">Gill et al, 2009b</a>]. A large cohort study (n = 1800 exposed infants) supported these findings [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-pregnancy-associated/references/\">Pasternak and Hviid, 2010</a>]. <ul><li>UKMi also identified other smaller observational studies with similar conclusions and discussed that although there may be an indication from a couple of studies that omeprazole may be related to an increased risk of stillbirth or cardiac malformations, this could be due to chance. The lack of available RCTs and limitations to existing studies (for example different exposure times) and evidence of fetal toxicity with omeprazole in animal studies was also noted [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-pregnancy-associated/references/\">UKMi, 2014</a>].</li><li>The manufacturer of omeprazole found no adverse effects of omeprazole on pregnancy or the fetus from epidemiological studies of over 1000 exposures [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-pregnancy-associated/references/\">ABPI Medicines Compendium, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 4b8cbef5-98b0-43d9-8ded-543add9af813 --><!-- end item 1079f9c4-2087-4fb2-a470-f49ee596e507 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"cd2893a3-2df9-5fcb-8b45-4b81dcbf91a6","slug":"referral","fullItemName":"Referral","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field fb233e11-db0e-46ed-a854-c57c75356e3e --><h3>When should I refer or seek specialist advice?</h3><!-- end field fb233e11-db0e-46ed-a854-c57c75356e3e -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item ad4652d9-6829-4018-afac-512e6c81b407 --><!-- begin field 4bba55ca-1d65-4c4b-961f-afccf1b2d8a9 --><ul><li>Refer <em>immediately</em> (same-day) if there is dyspepsia and significant acute gastrointestinal bleeding.</li><li>Refer <em>urgently </em>to a gastroenterologist if there are features suggestive of malignancy.
