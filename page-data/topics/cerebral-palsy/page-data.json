Effects may include musculoskeletal problems, neurogenic bladder, gastro-oesophageal reflux, excessive salivation, and feeding and swallowing difficulties. </li><li>In resource-rich countries, the overall prevalance of CP is 2.0 to 3.5 per 1,000 live births.</li><li>Prematurity, multiple gestation, and maternal infection such as chorioamnionitis are the primary causes of CP.<ul><li>Approximately 35% of infants born prior to 26 weeks' gestation develop CP.</li><li>Prevalence of CP has been noted as 12.6 per 1,000 live births in twins, and 44.8 per 1,000 live births in triplets.</li></ul></li><li>Possible early motor features suggestive of CP include:<ul><li>Unusual fidgety movements or other abnormalities of movement, including asymmetry or paucity.</li><li>Abnormalities of tone, including hypotonia, spasticity, or dystonia.</li><li>Abnormal motor development, including late head control, rolling, and crawling.</li><li>Feeding difficulties.</li></ul></li><li>The most common delayed motor milestones in children with CP (corrected for gestational age) are:<ul><li>Not sitting by 8 months.</li><li>Not walking by 18 months.</li><li>Asymmetry of hand function before 1 year.</li></ul></li><li>Children at increased risk of CP should receive enhanced clinical and developmental follow‑up by a multidisciplinary team up to the age of 2 years (corrected for gestational age).</li><li>If CP is suspected by a general practitioner (GP), referral to a child development service for a multidisciplinary assessment is indicated, in order to facilitate early diagnosis and intervention.</li><li>Children with confirmed CP should receive specialist management from a local integrated multidisciplinary team:<ul><li>Depending on local availability, this may incorporate paediatric medicine, nursing care, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, dietetics, and psychology. </li><li>These teams can also enable access to other specialist services.</li></ul></li><li>Adults with CP should ideally have access to a network of specialist services:<ul><li>Depending on local availability, these may include advocacy support, learning disability services, mental health services, orthopaedic surgery (and post-surgery rehabilitation), rehabilitation engineering services, rehabilitation medicine or specialist neurology services, secondary care expertise for managing comorbidities, social care, specialist therapy services, and wheelchair services.</li></ul></li><li>The main roles of a GP in the management of a person with CP are in coordinating care, identifying associated problems early (and managing/referring where appropriate), and providing support to the person and their family/carers. <ul><li>Common medical issues in people with CP include nutritional problems, pain, mental health problems, constipation, gastro-oesophageal reflux, and respiratory problems.</li></ul></li><li>Other roles of a GP may include prescribing medications under shared care arrangements, providing information about physical activity, national screening services, support groups, social care, and obtaining a carer's assessment, supporting any transitions from child to adult care or from hospital to home, and assisting with advance care planning.</li></ul><!-- end field 61beaac1-3ed8-4d66-a97f-aa0600b1089e --><!-- end item b3b0078c-7eac-44d4-a88f-aa0600b1089e -->","topic":{"id":"cb080700-b809-5879-ba1c-4734226ab00f","topicId":"0f1011cb-425e-4af4-96bc-aa0600b1059f","topicName":"Cerebral palsy","slug":"cerebral-palsy","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"2c97cf22-ded7-5f6b-9971-01fa96e34742","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"199a5d03-ed79-5a2f-98f6-b2957bcb8e98","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"4beff83c-dbfa-5637-b784-ebf8ff3588cb","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"dbe5efff-8172-5718-a5c7-dc541fceaf89","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"9a469f88-c893-5796-9d0a-7fae1d29ea46","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"4377ee38-3a9b-5372-b6dd-1f61066abb6f","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"00a993ca-5a58-595b-a2ae-71e6bd0a4d5a","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"b2f18eae-4cd0-5e76-afee-943fd5d27473","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"b62686c1-ae56-5bc6-bde4-b081b3426c3c","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"0d458c8d-1e7b-54fd-a524-3b5a0e7674a4","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"9e93039d-84e2-5f74-968a-8af573f4329e","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
