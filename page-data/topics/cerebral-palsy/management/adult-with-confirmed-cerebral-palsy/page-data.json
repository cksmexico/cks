Be aware that some of these services may be provided by charities.</li><li><strong>Severity of CP will have been assessed by specialists involved in the person's care.</strong> The Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) is a 5‑level clinical classification system that describes the gross motor function of people with cerebral palsy based on self-initiated movement abilities. People assessed as level I are the most able and people assessed as level V are dependent on others for all their mobility needs.</li><li><strong>Reassessment by the multidisciplinary team may be required at different points an adult's life to ensure that changing needs are met, </strong>for example, during pregnancy and parenting, if the person experiences decreased mobility, and/or if there is loss of care and support from a parent.</li><li><strong>The key responsibilities of a general practitioner in the management of an adult with CP are in:</strong><ul><li><strong>Coordinating care.</strong></li><li><strong>Identifying associated problems early (and managing/referring where appropriate), and </strong></li><li><strong>Providing support to the person and/or their family/carers. </strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>When caring for an adult with CP:</strong><ul><li>Recognise any barriers to the person accessing primary care including communication difficulties, mental health problems, fear of stigma, lack of motivation, exhaustion, and practical issues such as access to transport and bulidings. Consider extending appointment times if necessary. Ensure that the person has an advocate, if required.</li><li>Refer adults to a service within the multidisciplinary team experienced in the management of neurological impairments if the person's ability to carry out their usual daily activities deteriorates or a neurosurgical or orthopaedic procedure is being considered that may affect their ability to carry out their usual daily activities. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Be aware that medical issues commonly experienced by people with cerebral palsy, that may be reported to/noted in primary care include:</strong><ul><li><strong>Communication difficulties:</strong><ul><li>Speech and communication needs in adults with CP may change with time and social circumstances. Ask adults with cerebral palsy (and their families and carers, if agreed) about any changes in their hearing, speech and communication.</li><li>Refer adults with CP who have communication difficulties to speech and language therapy services to assess their need for intervention.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Pain:</strong><ul><li>Common causes of pain in people with CP include musculoskeletal problems, increased muscle tone, muscle fatigue and immobility, constipation, vomiting, and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.</li><li>Assess for the presence, severity and location of pain using pain assessment tools including observational or descriptive pain scales.</li><li>Be aware that some people with CP have difficulty communicating or are unable to communicate that they are in pain.</li><li>Treat any identified underlying causes of pain. For more information, see the CKS topics on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/analgesia-mild-to-moderate-pain/\">Analgesia - mild-to-moderate pain</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/constipation/\">Constipation</a>, and <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-gord/\">Dyspepsia - proven GORD</a>.</li><li>Seek specialist advice where appropriate.</li><li>If the person has problems participating in physical activities because of pain or joint problems that do not respond to any other treatments, consider referring them to a musculoskeletal specialist or an orthopaedic surgeon with experience and expertise in managing musculoskeletal problems in adults with cerebral palsy.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Abnormal muscle tone:</strong><ul><li>Be aware that the severity of symptoms may fluctuate in response to health, social and emotional wellbeing, and environmental factors. Specific factors that may exacerbate spasticity or dystonia include bladder problems (for example, urinary tract infection or bladder stones), constipation, emotional distress, pain, posture, pressure sores, changes in home or work environments, including seating, and medication changes and side effects. Address any modifiable factors that may be exacerbating the person's spasticity or dystonia. For further information, see the CKS topics on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/analgesia-mild-to-moderate-pain/\">Analgesia - mild-to-moderate pain</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/constipation/\">Constipation</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/urinary-tract-infection-lower-men/\">Urinary tract infection (lower) - men</a>, and <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/urinary-tract-infection-lower-women/\">Urinary tract infection (lower) - women</a>.</li><li>Consider prescribing enteral baclofen as the first-line drug treatment for adults with CP and generalised spasticity causing functional impairment, pain, or spasms. For more information, see the section on <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cerebral-palsy/prescribing-information/baclofen/\">prescribing information</a>. If enteral baclofen is ineffective or not tolerated, refer the person to a tone or spasticity management service, where other interventions may be offered, including Botulinum toxin type A injections, intrathecal baclofen, and selective dorsal rhizotomy. When considering a treatment for abnormal muscle tone, discuss with the person, and document their treatment goals.</li><li>In addition, consider referring adults with spasticity in a limited number of muscle groups that is affecting their care (such as hygiene or dressing), causing pain, or impairing activity and participation for botulinum toxin type A treatment.</li><li>Refer people with problematic dystonia (for example, affecting function, pain or participation) to a tone or spasticity management service to consider treatment options, which may include enteral anti-dystonic drug treatments, Botulinum toxin type A injections, intrathecal baclofen, and deep brain stimulation.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Bone and joint disorders:</strong><ul><li>Because of abnormal musculoskeletal development, adults with CP are more likely to have bone and joint disorders. Refer to a specialist orthopaedic or musculoskeletal service if a bone or joint disorder is suspected and causing pain or affecting posture or function. These may include osteoarthritis, cervical instability or spondylosis (including athetosis), spinal deformity (including scoliosis, kyphosis and lordosis), subluxation of the hips, wrist and shoulders, biomechanical knee problems, and abnormalities of the foot structure.</li><li>Be aware that low bone mineral density is common in adults with CP, particularly in people with reduced mobility or reduced weight bearing, taking anticonvulsants or proton pump inhibitors. Factors that may increase fracture risk include needing help with moving (especially hoisting), history of falls, low BMI, history of low-impact fractures, other medical factors that may adversely affect bone health (such as steroid use). If the person has two or more risk factors for fracture, consider referral for a dual-energy X‑ray absorptiometry (DXA) assessment, particularly if they have had a previous low-impact fracture.</li><li>Consider referral for specialist assessment and management, for example, to a rheumatology, endocrinology or bone health service, if the person has a high fracture risk or a positive DXA result.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Mental health problems:</strong><ul><li>Ask the person (and their family and carers, if agreed) if they are concerned about factors including mood, irritability, behaviour, social interaction, sleep, and/or general level of function.</li><li>Take into account factors that might affect the identification, assessment and management of mental health problems, such as communication difficulties, learning disabilities, impaired neuropsychological and executive functions, comorbidities, particularly epilepsy and pain, and side effects and drug interactions of multiple medicines (polypharmacy).</li><li>Discuss with the person (and their family and carers, if agreed) if physical problems, such as pain, or frustration from communication difficulties or lack of stimulation are contributing to emotional distress or challenging behaviour.</li><li>Manage any identified mental health problems/behavioural difficulties as appropriate. For more information, see the CKS topics on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/\">Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/autism-in-adults/\">Autism in adults</a>  <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression/\">Depression</a>, and <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/generalized-anxiety-disorder/\">Generalized anxiety disorder</a>.</li><li>Seek specialist advice if there is any uncertainty about management.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Nutritional problems:</strong><ul><li>Where possible, offer adults with CP a regular weight/BMI check and identify people who may be at risk of undernutrition or obesity.</li><li>Discuss with the person (and their family and carers, if agreed) whether they have difficulties with eating or if there have been any changes in their eating habits or bowel function. Ask about changes in appetite, changes in the person's ability to feed themselves, constipation, coughing or choking when eating, food refusal, increased frequency of chest infections (which may be related to swallowing difficulties or gastro-oesophageal reflux), and increased length of meal times.</li><li>Consider that factors that may affect appetite, eating habits, or weight include changes in carer support, depression, pain, reduced physical activity, and side effects of medications.</li><li>Refer to a relevant clinical specialist, such as a dietitian or speech and language therapist, if assessment suggests the person has difficulties with eating or malnutrition.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Respiratory disorders:</strong><ul><li>Adults with severe CP may have risk factors for respiratory impairment, such as aspiration pneumonia, chronic cardiorespiratory disorders (for example, cor pulmonale or pulmonary circulation hypertension), chronic suppurative lung disease, kyphoscoliosis, poor saliva control, and recurrent chest infections. Consider spirometry assessment for people suspected to be at high risk of respiratory impairment. Refer people with persistent or multiple signs and symptoms of respiratory impairment, or risk factors for respiratory impairment to specialist services.</li><li>Offer vaccinations to adults with CP in line with the national immunisation programme. For further information, see the CKS topics on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/immunizations-pneumococcal/\">Immunizations - pneumococcal</a> and <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/immunizations-seasonal-influenza/\">Immunizations - seasonal influenza</a>.</li><li>Refer people with recurrent chest infections and suspected dysphagia to a speech and language therapist with training in dysphagia, to assess swallowing.</li><li>If a person with CP is at high risk of lower respiratory tract infection, consider referral to physiotherapy for a prophylactic chest care review. </li><li>Prophylactic antibiotics for lower respiratory tract infections may be initiated by a respiratory specialist with expertise in neurodisability management if the person is at high risk of respiratory impairment. These may then be prescribed by a primary care physician as part of a shared care arrangement.</li><li>Be aware that adults with cerebral palsy are at increased risk of respiratory failure. Symptoms may include breathlessness, changes in behaviour (such as irritability or inability to concentrate), daytime drowsiness, worsening epilepsy, headaches on waking, increasing frequency of chest infections, poor sleep pattern, and sleep apnoea.</li><li>Home-based non-invasive ventilation for adults with cerebral palsy and respiratory failure may be appropriate. Seek specialist advice where there is uncertainty.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</strong> — for information on management, please see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-gord/\">Dyspepsia - proven GORD</a>.
