--><ul><li><strong>Children with CP should receive specialist management via a local integrated multidisciplinary team. </strong><ul><li>Depending on local availability, this may incorporate paediatric medicine, nursing care, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, dietetics, and psychology. </li><li>Such teams can also enable access to other specialist services, including paediatric neurodisability, neurology, neurorehabilitation, respiratory, gastroenterology and surgical specialist care, orthopaedics, orthotics and rehabilitation services, social care, visual and hearing specialist services, and teaching support for preschool and school-age children, including portage (home teaching services for preschool children). </li></ul></li><li><strong>The key responsibilities of a general practitioner in the management of a child with CP are in:</strong><ul><li><strong>Coordinating care where necessary.</strong></li><li><strong>Identifying associated <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cerebral-palsy/background-information/complications-comorbidities/\">problems</a> early (and managing/referring where appropriate), and </strong></li><li><strong>Providing support to the child and/or their parents/carers. </strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>Referral from primary care may involve notifying the multidisciplinary team of any newly recognised issues so that they can manage or refer accordingly, or direct referral to an appropriate specialist, depending on local arrangements for accessing the required services.</strong></li><li><strong>Be aware that common issues for which a primary care physician may be the first point of contact include:</strong><ul><li><strong>Problems with eating, drinking, and swallowing </strong>— the child or young person should be referred to a specialist with training in assessing and treating dysphagia if there are clinical concerns about: <ul><li>Coughing, choking, gagging, altered breathing pattern or change in colour while eating or drinking.</li><li>Recurrent chest infection.</li><li>Mealtimes regularly being stressful or distressing for the child or young person or their parents or carers.</li><li>Prolonged meal duration.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Concerns about speech, language and communication</strong> — during routine reviews, it is appropriate to assess speech, language and communication, including speech intelligibility. If concerns are noted or raised by the parent/carer, the child or young person should be assessed by a speech and language therapist within the local multidisciplinary team.</li><li><strong>Nutritional status </strong>— this should be regularly reviewed in children and young people with cerebral palsy, including measurement of height and weight (where possible). If there are concerns about oral intake, growth, or nutritional status, assessment and nutritional interventional support from a dietitian should be offered. If oral intake is still insufficient to provide adequate nutrition after assessment and nutritional interventions, the child or young person should be referred for assessment for enteral tube feeding by a specialist within the multidisciplinary team with relevant expertise.</li><li><strong>Drooling </strong>— be aware that factors that may affect drooling include positioning, medication history, reflux and dental issues. The local integrated multidisciplinary team should be made aware of any issues and may<strong> </strong>determine the need for anticholinergic medication such as glycopyrronium bromide (oral or by enteral tube), transdermal hyoscine hydrobromide, or with input from specialist services, trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride for children with dyskinetic cerebral palsy. GPs may subsequently be involved in prescribing these medications under local shared care arrangements. Other specialist interventions which may be offered to relieve drooling include high-dose botulinum toxin A injection to the salivary glands and in some situations salivary gland surgery.</li><li><strong>Pain </strong>— condition-specific causes of pain in people with CP include musculoskeletal problems, increased muscle tone, muscle fatigue and immobility, constipation, vomiting, and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Children and young adults with CP may also experience other common types of pain such as back pain, headache, abdominal pain, dental pain, and dysmenorrhea. Ask about signs of pain and related discomfort, distress, and sleep disturbance at every contact.<ul><li>Recognise that assessing the presence and degree of pain in children and young people with CP can be challenging, especially if there are difficulties with communication, registering or processing sensory information, or there is a learning disability.</li><li>If the cause of pain is not clear after routine assessment, the child or young person should be assessed by the specialist multidisciplinary team.</li><li>If the cause of pain is identified and pain is mild to moderate, consider a 'stepped approach' trial of simple analgesia (such as paracetamol and/or ibuprofen) For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/analgesia-mild-to-moderate-pain/\">Analgesia - mild-to-moderate pain</a>.</li><li>If there is any doubt, or a trial of analgesia is unsuccessful, seek advice from the local multidisciplinary team, or an appropriate pain specialist.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Sleep disturbances </strong>— recognise that parents and carers have the primary role in identifying sleep disturbances in children and young people with CP.  In order to assess sleep disturbances, consider using sleep questionnaires or diaries.<ul><li>Optimise sleep hygiene for children and young people with cerebral palsy.</li><li>Manage any identified treatable causes of sleep disturbances.</li><li>If no treatable cause is found, a trial of melatonin (off license) may be appropriate, particularly if there are problems with falling asleep. This should be inititated by a specialist.</li><li>Do <em>not </em>offer regular sedative medication to manage primary sleep disorders in children with cerebral palsy without seeking specialist advice.</li><li>The child or young person should be referred to specialist sleep services for multidisciplinary team assessment and management if there are ongoing sleep disturbances.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Mental health problems</strong> — children and young people with cerebral palsy should be referred for specialist psychological assessment and ongoing management if there are concerns about their mental health or if they experience persistent emotional and/or behavioural difficulties. Routine behavioural difficulties can be managed within the multidisciplinary team, with onward referral to specialist services if difficulties persist. Medications prescribed by a specialist to treat mental health problems in children and young adults with CP may subsequently be prescibed by a GP under a local shared care arrangement.</li><li><strong>Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</strong> — for information on management, please see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/gord-in-children/\">GORD in children</a>. Use clinical judgement to determine whether specialist referral is appropriate. If there is a marked change in the pattern of any vomiting, assess for a clinical cause.</li><li><strong>Constipation</strong> — Children and young people with CP should receive regular clinical assessments for constipation. For information on management, please see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/constipation-in-children/\">Constipation in children</a>. Use clinical judgement to determine whether specialist referral is appropriate.</li><li><strong>Epilepsy</strong> — urgently refer following local protocols if new-onset or worsening seizures are reported. For more information on general management, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/epilepsy/\">Epilepsy</a>. GPs may subsequently be involved in prescribing anticonvulsant medications under local prescribing arrangements.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Note: If the child has a learning disability, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/learning-disabilities/\">Learning disabilities</a> for specific advice on management.</strong></li><li><strong>Where medication inititated by a specialist is subsequently to be prescribed in primary care as part of a shared care arrangement, the GP should have received clear guidance relating to:</strong><ul><li>Monitoring of beneficial and side effects.</li><li>Dosage.</li><li>How long the medication should be taken for.</li><li>Plans for stopping the medication (if applicable).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Other roles of a primary care physician in the general care of a child with CP can include:</strong><ul><li><strong>Providing information to the parents/carers about:</strong><ul><li>Local and regional services available (such as sporting clubs, voluntary organisations, respite care, and specialist schools).</li><li>Support groups (including psychological and emotional support for the child or young person and their parents or carers and siblings).</li><li>Resources available and access to financial, respite and hospice services, social care, and other support for children and young people and their parents, carers and siblings.</li><li>Obtaining a formal carer's assessment of their own needs (including their physical and mental health). Carers should be encouraged to register themselves as a carer, for example, with their own GP. </li><li>Transition from child to adult care.
