Osteoporosis itself is asymptomatic and often remains undiagnosed until a fragility fracture occurs.</li><li>An osteoporotic fracture is a fragility fracture occurring as a consequence of increased bone fragility caused by osteoporosis. Characteristically fractures occur in the wrist, spine, and hip. A fragility fracture is defined as a fracture following a fall from standing height or less, although vertebral fractures may occur spontaneously, or as a result of routine activities.</li><li>In England and Wales, it is estimated that annually around 180,000 fractures occur as a result of osteoporosis.</li><li>Risk factors for osteoporosis include:<ul><li>Female gender.</li><li>Increasing age.</li><li>Menopause.</li><li>Oral corticosteroids.</li><li>Smoking.</li><li>Alcohol.</li><li>Previous fragility fracture.</li><li>Rheumatological conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthropathies.</li><li>Parental history of hip fracture.</li><li>Body mass index of less than 18.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.</li></ul></li><li>Investigations to check for non-osteoporotic causes for fragility fracture (such as metastatic bone cancer) and undiagnosed secondary causes (such as hyperthyroidism) should be arranged where appropriate, prior to calculating fracture risk. <br></li><li>A 10-year fragility fracture risk score should be calculated prior to arranging a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan to measure bone mineral density (BMD), or starting a bisphosphonate, except in people:</li><ul><li>Over 50 years of age with a history of fragility fractures — a DXA scan should be offered.</li><li>Under 40 years of age who have a major risk factor for fragility fracture — a DXA scan should be offered, then referral to a specialist experienced in the treatment of osteoporosis depending on the BMD T-score. The T-score is the number of standard deviations below the mean BMD of young adults at their peak bone mass.</li><li>With vertebral or hip fractures — starting treatment without undertaking DXA should be considered if this is inappropriate or impractical.</li></ul><li>Fragility fracture risk should be calculated using the QFracture® (preferred) or FRAX® online assessment calculators.<ul><li>People at high risk should be offered a DXA scan to confirm osteoporosis.</li><li>People at intermediate risk whose fracture risk is close to the recommended threshold and who have risk factors that may be underestimated by FRAX®, such as people taking high doses of oral corticosteroids, should be offered a DXA scan.</li><li>People at low risk should not be offered treatment or a DXA scan, but given lifestyle advice.</li></ul></li><li>A bisphosphonate should be offered to people with a BMD T-score of -2.5 or less, if appropriate and there are no contraindications. </li><li>Hormone replacement therapy should be offered to women who have experienced a premature menopause to reduce their risk of osteoporotic fracture, and for the relief of menopausal symptoms.</li><li>Risk factors for osteoporosis, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and calcium and vitamin D deficiency, should be managed if present.</li><li>Risk factors for falls should be managed if present.</li><li>Follow up should be arranged to assess and manage the:<ul><li>Adverse effects of bone-sparing treatment.</li><li>Adherence to treatment.</li><li>Need for continuing treatment with bisphosphonates after 3–5 years.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field af74a1b7-6b1a-4b55-816a-232c0ff1c7e4 --><!-- end item 8bf1b2ab-f239-44f4-acbb-7cf49f6cfe63 -->","topic":{"id":"9f86812a-068c-512b-a1a4-07fda4301d21","topicId":"a4e2c95c-bf7f-4277-b693-c3b2761380ed","topicName":"Osteoporosis -
