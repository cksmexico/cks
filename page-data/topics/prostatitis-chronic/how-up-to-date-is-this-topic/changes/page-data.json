This was on the advice of the MHRA and the European Medicines Agency. EMA reviewed serious, disabling and potentially permanent side effects with quinolone and fluoroquinolone antibiotics given by mouth, injection or inhalation.</p><p>The EMA human medicines committee (CHMP) confirmed that the use of the remaining fluoroquinolone antibiotics should be restricted. In addition, the prescribing information for healthcare professionals and information for patients will describe the disabling and potentially permanent side effects and advise patients to stop treatment with a fluoroquinolone antibiotic at the first sign of a side effect involving muscles, tendons or joints and the nervous system.</p><p>Restrictions on the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics will mean that they should <strong>not</strong> be used:</p><ul><li>To treat infections that might get better without treatment or are not severe (such as throat infections);</li><li>To treat non-bacterial infections, e.g. non-bacterial (chronic) prostatitis;</li><li>For preventing traveller’s diarrhoea or recurring lower urinary tract infections (urine infections that do not extend beyond the bladder);</li><li>To treat mild or moderate bacterial infections unless other antibacterial medicines commonly recommended for these infections cannot be used. </li></ul><p><strong>January 2019</strong> — minor update. Aortic aneurysm and dissection is now listed as an adverse effect of ciprofloxacin. </p><p><strong>September 2017 </strong>— minor update. SPC update on quinolones to align all CKS topics prescribing advice. Prostatitis – chronic, Gonorrhoea, Pyelonephritis, Diarrhoea – prevention and advice for travellers, Dyspepsia – unidentified cause, Dyspepsia – proven functional, Dyspepsia – proven peptic ulcer, Diverticular disease, Gastroenteritis and Scrotal pain and swellings. </p><p><strong>December 2016 </strong>— minor update.</p><ul><li>The adverse effects section for ciprofloxacin has been updated to include vision disorders in line with the manufacturer's updated Summary of Product Characteristics.</li><li>Uveitis, severe liver injury and exfoliative dermatitis have been added as possible adverse effects of ofloxacin, in line with the manufacturer's updated Summary of Product Characteristics.</li></ul><p><strong>December 2014 to February 2015 </strong>— reviewed. A literature search was conducted in December 2014 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key RCTs published since the last revision of this topic. The main changes are to the management section. For men with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome initial management in primary care now includes a 4–6 week trial of an alpha-blocker or an antibiotic (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin or trimethoprim if a quinolone is contraindicated or not tolerated).</p><p> </p><p><strong>February 2013 </strong>— minor update. The 2013 QIPP options for local implementation have been added to this topic.</p><p><strong>October 2012 </strong>— minor update. The 2012 QIPP options for local implementation have been added to this topic.</p><p><strong>September 2010 </strong>— minor update. The lower age limit for quinolone prescriptions has been raised from 16 to 18 years. Issued in September 2010.</p><p><strong>June 2010 — </strong>minor update. The recommendation to delay PSA testing if the man has ejaculated in the past 48 hours has been removed — the evidence that ejaculation affects PSA levels is inconsistent and unconvincing. Issued in June 2010.</p><p><strong>May 2009 </strong>— minor update. A section on the <em>Complications </em>has been added.</p><p><strong>August 2009 </strong>— minor update. The <em>Diagnosis </em>section about the PSA test now includes advice on when to defer testing (e.g. for at least 1 week after digital rectal examination). Issued in August 2009.</p><p><strong>October 2008 to February 2009 </strong>— converted from CKS guidance to CKS topic structure. The evidence-base has been reviewed in detail, and recommendations are more clearly justified and transparently linked to the supporting evidence. The only major change to the recommendations is to offer an antibiotic only when there is clinical evidence (such as a previous urinary tract infection) that makes bacterial infection likely. Together with the CKS topic on <em>Prostatitis - acute</em>, this CKS topic replaces the former topic on <em>Prostatitis.</em></p><p><strong>June 2005 </strong>— reviewed. Validated in September 2005 and issued in November 2005.</p><p><strong>December 2001 </strong>— rewritten, replacing guidance on <em>Prostatitis — acute</em>. Validated in March 2002 and issued in April 2002.</p><p><strong>January 2000 </strong>— reviewed.</p><p><strong>December 1998 </strong>— written.
