However, the benefits of domperidone still outweigh the risks [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-nausea-vomiting/references/\">McNeil Products Ltd and Winthrop Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, 2011</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field 851e6343-e2a0-404b-83e8-be9f09fd204e --><!-- end item ced86f6a-fcfa-4b87-87e2-2053516bac0a -->","topic":{"id":"8a2e6dd8-7d6f-5fcf-a744-1b12e2a14232","topicId":"329a162f-132a-4d7e-afd5-7ff2f86369d2","topicName":"Palliative care -
