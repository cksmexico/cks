For example, discuss the following:<ul><li>Stroke risk reduction — DOACs are non-inferior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke in people with AF [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/atrial-fibrillation/references/\">Ruff et al, 2014</a>].</li><li>Risks associated with treatment — DOACs are associated with a reduced risk of haemorrhagic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage compared with warfarin.</li><li>Adherence to treatment — adherence to anticoagulation treatment is vital, but is more important with the NOACs than with warfarin. This is because the DOACs have a relatively short half-life and their anticoagulant effect fades rapidly after 12 to 24 hours. With warfarin, some benefit is retained for 48 to 72 hours after missing a dose.</li><li>Monitoring of treatment — DOACs have predictable pharmacokinetics, so coagulation control does not need to be monitored. Warfarin, on the other hand, needs regular blood tests to monitor coagulation control.</li><li>Reversibility of effect — unlike warfarin, there are, as yet, no specific antidotes for DOACs; however, there are steps that can be taken to reverse their effect in the event of a major bleed.</li></ul></li><li>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has produced a <a data-hyperlink-id=\"14fa2bc8-9564-429f-bdc5-a8f701556a0b\" href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg180/resources/cg180-atrial-fibrillation-update-patient-decision-aid2\">patient decision aid</a> to help people decide on the most suitable option.</li></ul></li><li><strong>If anticoagulation is contraindicated</strong>, consider offering a combination of aspirin and clopidogrel.
