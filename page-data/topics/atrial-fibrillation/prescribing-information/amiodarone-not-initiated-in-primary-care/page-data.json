If this occurs, stop treatment with amiodarone.<ul><li>If bradycardia is severe and symptomatic, refer to secondary care for consideration of a pacemaker.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Visual disorders </strong>are common, and most people develop corneal microdeposits during treatment with amiodarone. These rarely interfere with vision, but drivers may be dazzled by headlights at night.<ul><li>If vision is impaired or if neuropathy or optic neuritis (very rare) occurs, stop amiodarone treatment (to prevent blindness), and seek specialist advice. The manufacturer recommends annual eye examinations in all people taking amiodarone; however, expert opinion suggests that these are only necessary for people with visual symptoms.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Neurological symptoms</strong>, such as tremor, ataxia, and (rarely) peripheral neuropathy, have been associated with amiodarone treatment. These are usually seen with loading doses and improve when maintenance treatment is started. Peripheral neuropathy may occur in people who have been taking amiodarone for a long time.</li><li><strong>Photosensitivity reactions </strong>are common and may persist for several months after stopping amiodarone treatment. A blue-grey skin discolouration has been reported in approximately 2% of people taking amiodarone.

If colestyramine is started, monitor the person for decreased amiodarone effects. If necessary, seek specialist advice about adjusting the amiodarone dose, or consider prescribing an alternative to colestyramine.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Centrally acting anticholinesterases</strong><ul><li>The risk of adverse effects, including bradycardia, may be increased if amiodarone is given with a centrally acting anticholinesterase (such as galantamine, donepezil, or rivastigmine).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Drugs that prolong the QT interval</strong><ul><li>Only specialists should co-prescribe amiodarone and drugs that prolong the QT interval. This is because of the risk of additive effects, which may lead to serious and potentially life-threatening torsades de pointes arrhythmias. Examples of drugs that are known to have a high risk of causing QT prolongation include:<ul><li>Antiarrhythmics, such as sotalol, disopyramide, and quinidine.</li><li>Antihistamines, such as astemizole and terfenadine.</li><li>Antipsychotics, such as amisulpride, haloperidol, and droperidol.</li><li>Antibiotics, such as erythromycin and clarithromycin.</li><li>Antidepressants, such as citalopram, escitalopram, clomipramine, and amitriptyline; and lithium.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Drugs that affect the liver enzyme cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4</strong><ul><li>Drugs that <em>inhibit </em>CYP 3A4 may increase serum concentration of amiodarone with the potential for toxicity. Examples include erythromycin, azole antifungals, and protease inhibitors. Grapefruit juice should also be avoided.<ul><li>Concomitant use of fluconazole with amiodarone is contraindicated [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/atrial-fibrillation/references/\">ABPI, 2015</a>]. </li></ul></li><li>Drugs that <em>induce </em>CYP 3A4 may decrease serum concentrations of amiodarone with the potential for loss of efficacy. Examples include carbamazepine, rifampicin, midazolam, lidocaine, fentanyl, sildenafil, St John's wort, and phenytoin. Amiodarone may also inhibit the hepatic metabolism of phenytoin resulting in an increase in phenytoin plasma levels.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Digoxin</strong><ul><li>Amiodarone may increase plasma levels of digoxin because of reduced renal digoxin clearance. If concurrent use is indicated, prescribe half the recommended dose of digoxin, and monitor the person closely in view of potential toxicity.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Hepatitis C drugs</strong><ul><li>Concomitant use of amiodarone and some drugs used to treat hepatitis C (Harvoni<sup>® </sup>[sofosbuvir with ledipasvir] or a combination of Sovaldi<sup>® </sup>[sofosbuvir] and Daklinza<sup>® </sup>[daclatasvir], or Sovaldi® and Olysio® [simeprivir]) may increase the risk of severe bradycardia or heart block [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/atrial-fibrillation/references/\">EMA, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/atrial-fibrillation/references/\">MHRA, 2015</a>]. The summary of product characteristics for Sovaldi<sup>®</sup> states that life-threatening cases of severe bradycardia and heart block have been observed when sofosbuvir is used in combination with another direct-acting antiviral and concomitant amiodarone (with or without other drugs that lower heart rate). Amiodarone should therefore only be used in patients taking Sovaldi and another DAA when other alternative anti-arrhythmic treatments are not tolerated or are contraindicated. Patients should be monitored closely [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/atrial-fibrillation/references/\">ABPI, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li><li><strong>Simvastatin</strong><ul><li>Rarely, myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in people taking amiodarone with high doses of simvastatin. The dose of simvastatin should not exceed 20 mg a day in people taking amiodarone unless the clinical benefit is likely to outweigh the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Stimulant laxatives</strong><ul><li>Concurrent use of amiodarone and a stimulant laxative (such as senna) may cause hypokalaemia, thus increasing the risk of torsades de pointes. Consider prescribing other types of laxatives (for example bulk forming [such as ispaghula husk] or osmotic laxatives [such as lactulose]).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Warfarin</strong><ul><li>The anticoagulant effects of warfarin are increased by amiodarone. The onset of this interaction may be slow (up to 2 weeks), with the peak effect occurring about 7 weeks after warfarin treatment is started. Reduce the dose of warfarin by one-third to two-thirds if amiodarone is added, and monitor the international normalized ratio (INR) once a week for the first 7 weeks of concurrent treatment.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Be aware that amiodarone has a long half-life (25–100 days); thus, interactions may occur for some time after drug withdrawal.</strong></p><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/atrial-fibrillation/references/\">DTB, 2003</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/atrial-fibrillation/references/\">Preston, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/atrial-fibrillation/references/\">ABPI, 2017d</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/atrial-fibrillation/references/\">Joint Formulary Committee, 2019</a>]</p><!-- end field 19c4e73a-349f-4868-be42-8734667d04d9 --><!-- end item d371342e-ce4b-47c1-8ad9-dc657b2109bd -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
