<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/atrial-fibrillation/references/\">ICSI, 2008</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to refer people with AF associated with a pre-excitation syndrome, valvular heart disease, or heart failure is based on expert opinion that these conditions may require specialist interventions such as pulmonary vein isolation, pacemaker therapy, arrhythmia surgery, catheter ablation, or atrial defibrillation, to reduce the risk of acute ventricular dysfunction [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/atrial-fibrillation/references/\">Fuster et al, 2011</a>].</li></ul><h5>Driving</h5><ul><li>The information on driving is based on the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency's (DVLA's) guidance for medical practitioners: <em>At a glance guide to the current medical standards of fitness to drive </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/atrial-fibrillation/references/\">DVLA, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Flying</h5><ul><li>The information on flying is based on the British Heart Foundation Factfile: <em>Fitness to fly for passengers with cardiovascular disease</em>, which is based on the British Cardiovascular Society Working Group's expert guidance [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/atrial-fibrillation/references/\">BHF, 2010</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Follow-up</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to follow-up a person within 1 week of starting rate-control treatment or any dose alteration to assess tolerance, symptom control, heart rate, and blood pressure is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good medical practice and is also supported by previous expert reviewers of this CKS topic.<ul><li>For people who cannot tolerate the initial treatment, CKS recommends prescribing an alternative rate-control drug because tolerance to different treatments varies from person-to-person.</li><li>For people whose symptoms, heart rate, and/or blood pressure are not controlled, NICE recommends combination treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/atrial-fibrillation/references/\">NICE, 2014a</a>]. However, CKS pragmatically recommends trying the maximum dose of the initial treatment before considering combination treatment because a dose increase may improve symptoms without the increased risk of adverse effects associated with combination treatment.</li><li>For people whose symptoms are not controlled by combination treatment, NICE recommends prompt referral based on evidence that found a clinical benefit for mortality, hospitalization, adherence to guidelines, and disease awareness favouring referral to specialist care compared with usual care. Based on their collective experience, the GDG defined prompt referral as within 4 weeks of the final failed treatment (or for cardioversion, when atrial fibrillation [AF] recurrence occurred) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/atrial-fibrillation/references/\">NICE, 2014b</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation to assess INR regularly in a person who has just started warfarin treatment is based on expert opinion in the British National Formulary (BNF), which states that when a vitamin K antagonist is started 'It is essential that the INR be determined daily or on alternate days in early days of treatment, <em>then</em> at longer intervals (depending on response), <em>then</em> up to every 12 weeks' [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/atrial-fibrillation/references/\">Joint Formulary Committee, 2019</a>] (based on [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/atrial-fibrillation/references/\">Keeling, 2011</a>]).</li></ul><h5>Corrected heart rate</h5><ul><li><p>The recommendations on corrected ventricular rate are based on expert opinion in the international <em>Guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/atrial-fibrillation/references/\">Fuster et al, 2011</a>].</p></li></ul><h5>Review</h5><ul><li>NICE states that many people with atrial fibrillation (AF) are elderly and have multiple comorbidities which can change over time. Regular assessment of the person's symptoms and their risk of stroke, bleeding, and other cardiovascular events are therefore needed. </li><li>NICE states that annual review of stroke and bleeding risks is indicated for people who are <em>not </em>taking an anticoagulant.</li><li>NICE advises that for people who are taking an anticoagulant, the need for anticoagulation and the quality of anticoagulation should be reviewed at least annually, or more frequently if clinically relevant events occur affecting anticoagulation or bleeding risk [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/atrial-fibrillation/references/\">NICE, 2014b</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field 456c5a24-eca2-4b8b-bffa-aa4501376389 --><!-- end item 2fac14d7-de25-4054-a22c-aa450137634c -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
