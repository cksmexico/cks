Removal of '8 units a week or more' as harmful alcohol consumption with regards to HAS-BLED scoring. This is in line with the NICE recommendation of using clinical judgement to define harmful alcohol consumption.</p><p><strong>April 2014 to July 2014 </strong>— reviewed. A literature search was conducted in March 2014 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key RCTs published since the last revision of this topic. The following changes have been made in line with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline <em>Atrial fibrillation: the management of atrial fibrillation</em>:</p><ul><li>Following assessment, rate-control treatment is now the first-line treatment for most people with atrial fibrillation (AF). Referral for rhythm-control treatment (cardioversion), in addition to rate-control treatment, may be appropriate if:<ul><li>The person has AF with a reversible cause (for example a chest infection); heart failure thought to be primarily caused, or worsened, by AF; or new-onset AF. If the onset is known to be within 48 hours, referral should be to an acute medical unit (rather than to a cardiologist) for immediate cardioversion without the need for anticoagulation treatment. The urgency of the referral will depend on how soon the person presents within 48 hours.</li><li>Rate-control or anticoagulation treatment is contraindicated.</li><li>Rate-control treatment fails to control the symptoms of AF (prompt referral within 4 weeks is required).</li><li>The person is found to have valve disease or left ventricular systolic dysfunction on echocardiography.</li><li>Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome or a prolonged QT interval is suspected on the electrocardiogram.</li></ul></li><li>The HAS-BLED scoring tool is now recommended for assessing the risk of bleeding in people who are starting or have started anticoagulation, and to highlight, correct, and monitor certain modifiable risk factors (for example uncontrolled hypertension and harmful alcohol consumption).</li><li>Anticoagulation treatment with warfarin or a novel oral anticoagulant (apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban) is recommended for stroke prevention in people with AF and a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>VASc score of 2 or more. It should also be considered for men with AF and a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>VASc score of 1.</li><li>Aspirin is no longer recommended as monotherapy solely for stroke prevention in people with AF.</li><li>The lowest age of people with AF for which these recommendations apply to has been changed from 16 years to 18 years.</li></ul><p><strong>March 2014 </strong>— minor update. Text about assessing stroke risk in people with AF has been updated to include the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>VASc tool which takes a risk factor-based approach to guide decisions about antithrombotic treatment, in line with updated European Society of Cardiology guidelines.</p><p><strong>July 2013 </strong>— minor update. Links to the DVLA website have been updated.</p><p><strong>June 2013 </strong>— minor update.

Issued in October 2010.</p><p><strong>May to August 2009 </strong>— converted from CKS guidance to CKS topic structure. The evidence-base has been reviewed in detail, and recommendations are more clearly justified and transparently linked to the supporting evidence. There have been no major changes to the recommendations.</p><p><strong>March 2009 </strong>— minor update. The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) indicators for atrial fibrillation have been updated in the <em>Goals and outcome measures </em>section. Issued in April 2009.</p><p><strong>September 2008 </strong>— minor correction to the <em>Changes </em>section. Issued in September 2008.</p><p><strong>June 2007 </strong>— updated to include a link to the recent <em>Patient Safety Alert </em>from the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) on actions that can make anticoagulant therapy safer.
