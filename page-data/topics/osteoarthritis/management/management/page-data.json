In contrast, the effect of weight loss on pain is inconsistent in the literature. NICE notes that all of the studies have been performed in people with osteoarthritis of the knee, so it is difficult to generalise the results to other joints, and there is reduced evidence for the functional benefits of weight loss for osteoarthritis of the hip.</li><li>The EULAR task force systematic literature review cited very low- to moderate-quality studies which found inconsistent results of no effects and positive effects of weight management on pain in osteoarthritis of the knee.</li><li>The OARSI guidelines found good-quality evidence supporting the benefits of weight reduction on pain and functioning for overweight people with osteoarthritis of the knee.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Advice on exercise</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on exercise are largely based on the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>], the EULAR expert consensus document on pain management [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Geenen, 2018</a>], the OARSI consensus guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">McAlindon, 2014</a>], four Cochrane systematic reviews [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Fransen, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Fransen, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Bartels, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Osteras, 2017</a>], and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Dickson et al, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Glyn-Jones, 2015</a>] , as increasing muscle strength reduces joint loading and associated pain.<ul><li>The NICE guideline notes that the majority of the evidence on exercise is related to osteoarthritis of the knee, with good-quality evidence of the benefits of exercise compared with no exercise, which were usually seen at 18 months. It found more limited evidence for hip and hand involvement, and limited evidence that exercise in water may be beneficial in the short-term.</li><li>The EULAR task force performed a systematic literature review which found that for general exercise, strength and resistance training, and aerobic exercise, the quality of studies was low to moderate, and effects on pain were mostly positive in osteoarthritis.</li><li>The OARSI guidelines evaluated good-quality evidence from meta-analyses and found small but clinically relevant short-term benefits of combination strength training and aerobic exercise for pain and function for osteoarthritis of the knee. In addition, it found good-quality evidence of small-to-moderate short-term benefits of water-based exercise for osteoarthritis of the hip and knee, particularly regarding joint function and quality of life.</li><li>In addition, a Cochrane systematic review found good-quality evidence of short-term benefit that is sustained for at least 2–6 months in terms of reduced pain, and moderate-quality evidence of an improvement in function for people with osteoarthritis of the knee. It noted a lack of blinding in the majority of studies [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Fransen, 2015</a>]. Similar findings of a positive effect on pain and function were found in a systematic review of exercise for people with osteoarthritis of the hip [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Fransen, 2014</a>]. A further Cochrane systematic review found moderate-quality evidence that aquatic exercise may have small, short-term effects on patient-reported pain, disability, and quality of life in people with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Bartels, 2016</a>].</li><li>The recommendations on joint protection advice for hand involvement are based on the NICE guideline and expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Dickson et al, 2015</a>], and these are supported by a Cochrane systematic review which found low-quality evidence of small beneficial effects of exercise on hand pain, function, and finger joint stiffness [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Osteras, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Advice on footwear and orthotic devices</h5><ul><li>The recommendation on provision of suitable footwear and other orthotic devices is based on the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>], the EULAR task force systematic literature reviews on pain management [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Geenen, 2018</a>] and non-pharmacological management of hip and knee osteoarthritis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Fernandes et al, 2013</a>].<ul><li>The NICE guideline found limited data for the effectiveness of insoles (either wedged or neutral) in reducing symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee. In the context of a lack of good-quality trial data and the low cost of the intervention, the Guideline Development Group (GDG) recommended consideration of footware with shock-absorbing properties.</li><li>The EULAR document on pain management found positive effects of orthotics on pain for orthopaedic shoes in osteoarthritis of the knee, splints in osteoarthritis of the hand, and sleeves and elastic bandages in osteoarthritis of the knee [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Geenen, 2018</a>].</li><li>The EULAR document on non-pharmacological management specifies that appropriate shoes should have thick, shock-absorbing soles, to provide support for the arches of the foot, to control foot pronation, and provide adequate space for the toes [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Fernandes et al, 2013</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Advice on additional local heat, cold, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) treatments</h5><ul><li>These recommendations are based on the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>] and the OARSI consensus guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">McAlindon, 2014</a>].<ul><li>The NICE GDG found very limited, poor-quality evidence on the use of the application of local heat and cold in the management of osteoarthritis joint pain. In the GDG's experience, however, these interventions are widely used as part of self-management, are very low cost and are considered safe, therefore they are recommended as an additional treatment option.</li><li>NICE found evidence that TENS is clinically beneficial for pain relief and reduction of stiffness in knee osteoarthritis, especially in the short term, however this was not shown in a community setting. It concluded that intermittent use for exacerbations of symptoms may be a helpful additional treatment.</li><li>The OARSI guidelines concluded that the use of TENS is of uncertain benefit in people with knee-only osteoarthritis, on the basis of limited evidence which produced inconclusive results.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Advice on treatments not recommended</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to avoid glucosamine, chondroitin, and topical rubefacients is largely based on the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>], and is supported by the OARSI consensus guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">McAlindon, 2014</a>], a Cochrane systematic review [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Derry, 2014</a>], and expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Glyn-Jones, 2015</a>].<ul><li>The NICE guideline reviewed the evidence for glucosamine and chondroitin in isolation and in combination, and found a relative lack of data and inconsistent effects on outcomes of pain and functional improvement. There was very-low to low-quality evidence that in osteoarthritis of the knee, glucosamine preparations compared with placebo showed no clinically important difference for the outcome of pain. Similarly, the GDG noted that the evidence showed no clinically important difference between chondroitin and placebo in pain, stiffness, or joint function scores at 3 months.</li><li>This is supported by the OARSI guidelines which found glucosamine and chondroitin were both 'not appropriate' for osteoarthritis of the knee when used for disease modification, and of 'uncertain' benefit when used for symptom relief.</li><li>Topical rubefacients are counter-irritants of the skin that may have some pain-relieving effect in musculoskeletal disorders. The recommendation to avoid topical rubefacients is based on the NICE guideline and supported by a Cochrane systematic review which found no evidence to support the use of salicylate-containing products for chronic musculoskeletal conditions.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation that there is no evidence of clinical effectiveness for the use of acupuncture is based on the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>], the OARSI consensus guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">McAlindon, 2014</a>], and a Cochrane systematic review [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Manheimer, 2018</a>].<ul><li>NICE found no clinically important difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture in studies of osteoarthritis of the knee for the outcomes of pain reduction, functional improvement, and reduction of stiffness for short and long-term follow-up. Similarly, no clinically important difference was found between acupuncture and sham acupuncture in osteoarthritis of the hip for the outcomes of pain reduction or functional improvement.</li><li>The OARSI guidelines concluded that good-quality evidence on acupuncture for osteoarthritis of the knee was of 'uncertain' significance, as pooled analysis found statistically significant benefit of acupuncture in sham-controlled trials, but this did not reach the threshold for clinical significance.</li><li>A Cochrane systematic review concluded that acupuncture probably has little or no effect in improving pain or function relative to sham acupuncture in people with osteoarthritis of the hip, and small sample sizes of the trials were noted.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Providing psychosocial support</h5><ul><li>These recommendations are based on the EULAR expert consensus document on pain management [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Geenen, 2018</a>], and are also pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good medical practice.<ul><li>The EULAR task force systematic literature review cited very low- to moderate-quality studies which found positive effects on pain from psychological interventions (such as cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness programmes, and stress management).</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Advice on pain management</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on pain management are largely based on the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>], the OARSI consensus guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">McAlindon, 2014</a>], and the EULAR expert consensus document on pain management [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Geenen, 2018</a>].<ul><li>The NICE guideline notes that most studies have focused on osteoarthritis of the knee (or single joint involvement), and studies are often of short duration using single therapies. It found a large evidence-base from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the efficacy of paracetamol compared with placebo in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee, with less evidence to support its use for other joint involvement. It also found paracetamol appears to be less effective than oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), especially in people with moderate-to-severe pain. In addition, a NICE evidence review suggests that paracetamol may have reduced efficacy in the management of osteoarthritis than previously thought, and further evidence is awaited.<ul><li>This is supported by the OARSI guidelines, which highlights increased potential risks (such as gastrointestinal adverse effects) with paracetamol for people with co-morbidities, particularly when used for extended durations, and classifies the use of paracetamol for these people as of 'uncertain' benefit.</li></ul></li><li>NICE reviewed several studies predominantly of people with osteoarthritis of the knee which showed short-term benefits lasting less than four weeks following the use of topical NSAID gels, creams, and ointments when compared with placebo. It noted there are limited data comparing the efficacy and safety of topical with oral NSAIDs in people with osteoarthritis, and the reduction of adverse effects with topical NSAID use compared with oral use, when assessed in RCTs. No data were found comparing the risks and benefits of topical NSAID use with paracetamol.<ul><li>This is supported by the OARSI guidelines, which recommend topical NSAIDs for people with knee-only osteoarthritis, and found that, overall, these were safer and better tolerated compared with oral NSAIDs. It found topical NSAIDs were of uncertain benefit for people with multiple joint involvement.</li></ul></li><li>NICE cited a large body of trial evidence supporting the efficacy of oral NSAIDs in reducing pain and stiffness associated with osteoarthritis, with the majority of studies reflecting short-term use and involving osteoarthritis of the knee or hip. There was a lack of strong evidence to suggest a consistent benefit of oral NSAIDs over paracetamol or opioids, however, NICE noted the lack of well-designed comparator studies.<ul><li>This is supported by the OARSI guidelines which found good-quality evidence that oral NSAIDs benefit people with osteoarthritis of the knee, if there are no associated relevant co-morbidities which increase the risk of adverse effects.</li></ul></li><li>NICE found limited, poor-quality evidence on the use of opioids for the management of osteoarthritis, but concluded that compared with placebo, opioid analgesics reduce pain in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. It highlighted there is little evidence to support dose escalation of these agents, and there is a lack of trial data comparing the efficacy and safety of opioids with other symptomatic treatments for osteoarthritis. In addition, there are very limited data comparing different formulations or routes of administration of opioids, and no specific recommendations could be made.<ul><li>This is supported by the OARSI guidelines which designated oral opioid analgesia with an 'uncertain' recommendation for osteoarthritis of the knee, due to concerns about increased risks of serious adverse effects compared with placebo.</li></ul></li><li>Topical capsaicin is a counter-irritant of the skin that also affects neurotransmitters in sensory terminals, reducing the transmission of painful stimuli. NICE found limited evidence from small RCTs of people with osteoarthritis of the knee which showed some positive effects from topical capsaicin compared with placebo, with short-term follow-up. The GDG were aware of the widespread use of this agent for self-management of osteoarthritis of the hand, and felt that the study efficacy data for knee involvement could be extrapolated to the hand joint.<ul><li>This is supported by the OARSI guidelines which recommended the use of capsaicin for people with knee-only osteoarthritis without co-morbidities, on the basis of good-quality evidence which found its use was superior to placebo for outcomes of pain reduction.</li></ul></li><li>The EULAR publication notes that multiple biological and psychosocial factors may influence a person's perception and experience of pain, including pain severity, degree of joint damage, health beliefs, mood, avoidance behaviour, functional impairment, obesity, sleep quality, social support, and pacing (the balance of activities and rest through the day). A systematic literature review highlighted that studies were heterogeneous with respect to intervention and comparator conditions.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Arranging regular review</h5><ul><li>The recommendation on arranging regular review is largely based on the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>] together with expert opinion in the Arthritis Research UK publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Arthritis Research UK, 2013</a>], and expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/references/\">Glyn-Jones, 2015</a>], as osteoarthritis symptoms may fluctuate and progress over time as may people's goals and expectations of treatment.<ul><li>The NICE guideline also highlighted that information sharing should be an ongoing, integral part of the management plan, rather than a single event at the time of presentation.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 0ee9cb5d-b5eb-4729-a01f-8453a9e040bb --><!-- end item 50e3080e-9471-489a-9c7f-bac27b0f896f -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"21712210-cdd9-5dfe-b3cc-f4f16aeaa557","slug":"follow-up-referral","fullItemName":"Follow-up and referral","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field a4d1322e-300c-40b9-8443-a77400cc01fe --><h3>When should I follow-up and refer a person with osteoarthritis?</h3><!-- end field a4d1322e-300c-40b9-8443-a77400cc01fe -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item e3df30db-b96f-4612-bb93-a77400cc0009 --><!-- begin field f146dcdf-dfb8-41b0-8cf6-a77400cc01fe --><p><strong>If initial <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/management/management/#initial-management\">self-management strategies</a> and/or <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/management/management/#initial-management\">drug treatments</a> are ineffective or not tolerated, offer referral to the multidisciplinary team, depending on clinical judgement.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Consider referral to a physiotherapist or local musculoskeletal clinic</strong> for individualised physical treatment, which may include:<ul><li>Advice on local muscle strengthening exercises, aerobic fitness training, and pacing of activities (balance of activities and rest, ideally integrating physical activity into the person's daily routine).</li><li>Additional manipulation and stretching, especially for hip involvement.</li><li>Provision of protective joint supports, splints, braces, gloves, and sleeves to reduce the load for joint pain or instability.</li><li>Intra-articular corticosteroid injections for moderate-to-severe joint pain (if the appropriate expertise and training is not available in general practice).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Consider referral to an occupational therapist</strong> for advice on assistive devices for daily activities which reduce repetitive high loads to different joints.<ul><li>For the hip and knee — walking sticks and walking aids, long-handled reachers, sock aids to reduce bending, bath aids, chair and bed raisers, raised toilet seats, perch stools, half steps and grab rails, additional stair rails, and home adaptations to improve access and mobility.</li><li>For the hand — enlarged grips for writing, using small non-slip mats for opening objects, electric can openers and peelers, tap turners.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Consider referral to a podiatrist</strong> <strong>for</strong>:<ul><li>A biomechanical assessment of joint pain — altered use because of pain in one joint may lead to increased mechanical stress and pain at other sites.</li><li>Advice on orthotic devices, such as appropriate footwear and insoles, if needed.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Consider referral to an orthopaedic surgeon,</strong> irrespective of the person's age, body mass index (BMI), or co-morbidities, <em>before</em> the person has severe functional limitation and/or pain if:<ul><li>Symptoms of joint pain, stiffness, and functional impairment are refractory to primary care management <em>and</em></li><li>There is a significant impact on the person's quality of life.</li><li>There is uncertainty about the diagnosis or atypical symptoms.</li><li>There is a sudden worsening of symptoms.<ul><li>Surgical treatment usually involves joint replacement or fusion. Arthroscopic lavage and debridement may be considered for people with knee osteoarthritis with a clear history of mechanical locking.
