CKS recommends the use of different categories of dressings, but not specific dressings. The exact dressing used will depend on personal preference and experience.<ul><li>Vapour–permeable film dressings are recommended for use on wounds with low levels of exudate because:<ul><li>They are waterproof and protect the wound from becoming infected or wet during normal daily activities.</li><li>They maintain a moist environment for optimal wound healing.</li><li>They are comfortable and convenient to use.</li><li>They allow the wound to be visually inspected for infection without the dressings being removed.</li></ul></li><li>Low-adherence, absorbent, perforated dressings are recommended for wounds with moderate amounts of exudate because:<ul><li>They can absorb moderate amounts of exudate, which prevents the wound from becoming macerated but maintains a moist environment for optimal wound healing.</li><li>Exudate from the wound discolours the dressing and is easily seen.
