These may be non-specific and non-localized, such as general malaise, agitation, or behavioural change.</li><li>One or more risk factor(s) for sepsis, and who looks unwell.</li><li>Concern from a relative or carer that there is a change in appearance or behaviour.</li></ul></li><li>Urgent assessment of a person with suspected sepsis should include:<ul><li>Evaluation for physiological symptoms and signs to identify markers of increased risk of severe illness or death.</li><li>Use of a sepsis risk stratification tool to assess the risk of clinical deterioration from sepsis.</li></ul></li><li>Management of a person with suspected sepsis may include, depending on clinical judgement:<ul><li>Arranging emergency transfer to hospital (usually by 999 ambulance) if the person is at high risk of severe illness or death from sepsis, or moderate-to-high risk in certain clinical situations.</li><li>Managing the person in primary care if they are at high risk of severe illness or death from sepsis, but transfer of care to hospital would be unnecessarily burdensome or inappropriate, for example people who are very frail or approaching the end of life.</li><li>Managing any underlying condition and arranging follow-up in primary care, if there are any moderate-to-high risk criteria for severe illness or death from sepsis, and a definitive diagnosis has been identified, and this can be treated in primary care.</li><li>Managing the person in primary care if they are at low risk of severe illness or death from sepsis, and providing safety-netting information.</li></ul></li><li>Management of a person with a confirmed diagnosis of sepsis following hospital discharge may include:<ul><li>Providing the person and/or carers with advice on the nature of sepsis, what to expect during recovery, and sources of information and support.</li><li>Assessing and managing any complications following sepsis, such as anxiety and/or post-traumatic stress disorder; persistent fatigue; or chronic pain.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field df62d2ae-4736-49b7-8236-aa0600a5693f --><!-- end item 3a57d915-68af-4568-80e5-aa0600a5693e
