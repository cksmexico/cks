The lack of consistency between results and inability to perform a meta-analysis resulted in the guideline development group using consensus opinion and other literature to guide recommendations [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>]. </li><li>The recommendation to ask about symptoms suggesting specific infection is based on expert opinion in an international consensus document, as this may help to identify the source of infection and the likely infecting pathogen [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">Singer, 2016</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to assess for reduced urine output and clinical features of dehydration is based on the fact that people with sepsis are at high risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), and oliguria or anuria may indicate tissue hypoperfusion [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">Gauer, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>].</li><li>The NICE clinical guideline notes that changes in behaviour and/or mental state are a strong risk factor for mortality from sepsis, based on very low-quality evidence from observational studies, and the experience and opinion of the NICE guideline development group [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>]. This is supported by expert opinion in a review article, which notes that behaviour changes such as agitation may be the only clinical feature of sepsis in older people [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">Gauer, 2013</a>].</li><li>The NICE clinical guideline notes that changes in cognitive function in older people may present as acute changes in functional abilities [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>].</li><li>The NICE clinical guideline states there should be a high index of suspicion of sepsis if a person has additional risk factors for sepsis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>]. This is supported by expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">Gauer, 2013</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to check for risk factors for antibiotic resistance is based on the SSC international consensus report [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">Rhodes, 2017</a>] and expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">Keeley, 2017</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to ask about immunization status is extrapolated from expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">Plunkett, 2015</a>].</li></ul><h4>Assessing clinical features on examination</h4><ul><li>The RCGP publication notes that respiratory rate, blood pressure/perfusion, and cognition are the three physiological elements most predictive of sepsis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">RCGP, 2018</a>].</li><li>The recommendation on performing a cognitive assessment is based on the RCP report on the NEWS 2 tool [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">RCP, 2017</a>], and is supported by the expert opinion of an external reviewer of this CKS topic.</li><li>The recommendation not to use temperature as the sole predictor of sepsis is based on the NICE clinical guideline, which notes that some people with sepsis are less likely to present with fever, including the elderly, frail, very ill, people who are immunosuppressed (for example taking anticancer treatment), and young infants or children. This was based on very low-quality evidence from observational studies and the experience and opinion of the guideline development group [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>].<ul><li>A rise in temperature may be a normal physiological response in people following surgery or trauma [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>]. It may also, however, help in the diagnosis of underlying infection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">Singer, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The NICE clinical guideline notes that tachycardia is associated with a poorer prognosis and increased risk of morbidity and mortality from sepsis, based on very low-quality evidence from observational studies and the experience and opinion of the NICE guideline development group [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>].<ul><li>It also notes that older people with infection may not develop tachycardia, and may develop a new arrhythmia instead.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation to assess for increased respiratory rate and signs of respiratory distress is based on the fact that they are associated with a poorer prognosis, and pneumonia is a common cause of sepsis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>].</li><li>The recommendations on measuring blood pressure and oxygen saturation in community settings is based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>].<ul><li>NICE notes that extremes of blood pressure are a cause of clinical concern, but should always be interpreted in the context of previous recorded blood pressure readings, if possible.</li><li>In addition, expert opinion in a review article notes that normal blood pressure does not exclude a diagnosis of sepsis, as organ perfusion can be impaired in the context of normal blood pressure [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">Cecconi, 2018</a>]. This is supported by expert opinion in an additional review article, which notes that children often maintain blood pressure even in late stages of septic shock [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">Plunkett, 2015</a>].</li><li>The information that hypotension is a presenting feature in 40% of people with sepsis is based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">Gauer, 2013</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The information about a delayed capillary refill time is based on expert opinion in an international consensus document [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">Singer, 2016</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to check for skin colour changes, signs of cyanosis, or a non-blanching rash are based on the fact these indicate a high risk of severe illness or death from sepsis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>].</li></ul><h4>Using a sepsis risk stratification tool to assess risk of serious illness and deterioration</h4><ul><li>The recommendation to use a structured risk stratification tool is largely based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>], the RCP working party report [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">RCP, 2017</a>], the UK Sepsis Trust publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">Daniels, 2017</a>], and expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">Freitag, 2016</a>].<ul><li>These tools are designed to identify people at highest risk of morbidity and mortality from sepsis who need immediate potentially life-saving hospital treatment.</li><li>The RCP National Early Warning Score (NEWS) 2 tool is recommended in the RCP report as it has now been validated in many settings within the NHS and internationally, including emergency departments and pre-hospital settings (including use by paramedic crews). More specifically, it has been shown to be a strong indicator of increased risk of serious clinical deterioration and mortality in people with sepsis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">RCP, 2017</a>]. The NICE guideline development group state that the NEWS could be implementable in primary care, but note the lack of validation studies in this setting [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>], and the RCGP publication also states that the NEWS 2 can be considered as part of the assessment of a person with suspected sepsis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">RCGP, 2018</a>]. The use of the NEWS 2 tool in primary care is also supported by the expert opinion of two external reviewers of this CKS topic.</li><li>The NICE clinical guideline based their recommendations on low-quality evidence with low specificity and sensitivity, and the experience and opinion of the NICE guideline development group [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>]. An expert reviewer of this CKS topic notes that the NICE recommendations on risk stratification tools used data with poor predictive values which were not derived from primary care, and which may have limited applicability in this setting.</li><li>CKS notes that there are subtle differences between the classification of risk categories and management pathways of the UK Sepsis Trust publication and the NICE clinical guideline. The UK Sepsis Trust acknowledges these differences and suggests either risk assessment approach can be used [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">Daniels, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li><li>CKS notes that the Sepsis-3 Task Force has developed an additional risk stratification tool (the 'quick Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA]' or 'qSOFA' clinical score) to identify adults with suspected sepsis who are at increased risk of significant morbidity and mortality from organ dysfunction. A retrospective analysis mainly US-derived hospital data identified increased respiratory rate, altered mental state, and low systolic blood pressure as markers for people at increased risk of clinical deterioration and mortality. The Task Force noted that it uses readily measurable identifiers, does not need laboratory tests, and can be assessed quickly and repeatedly [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">Singer, 2016</a>].<ul><li>The NICE clinical guideline evidence review of different risk assessment tools including qSOFA found insufficient evidence that one scoring tool performs better than another, and concluded that qSOFA needs further validation in clinical practice [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>].</li><li>Several additional commentators note that the qSOFA score needs further prospective validation in diverse clinical settings, and it may have reduced applicability as a stand-alone screening tool in the UK due to various limitations [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">Gotts, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">Daniels, 2017</a>]. Furthermore, it is not validated for use in children [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sepsis/references/\">Fleischmann-Struzek, 2018</a>]. As a result, CKS has not currently recommended this tool for use in UK community settings.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 8827db75-2128-48ec-b0ac-aa53008ea78e --><!-- end item fbdca5cf-7a8e-46f6-8dab-aa53008ea73f -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
