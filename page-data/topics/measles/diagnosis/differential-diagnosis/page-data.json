This is a mild self-limiting illness that, in addition to a bright red rash on the cheeks, may cause a red, lacy rash on the rest of the body which can be mistaken for measles. However, there are no Koplik's spots. Arthralgia and arthritis may occur in adults.</li><li><strong>Streptococcal infection</strong> (for example scarlet fever) — can cause a maculopapular rash which appears on the abdomen and spreads to the back and limbs 12–24 hours following symptom onset. Sore throat is usually a prominent symptom and cough generally is not a feature. 'Strawberry tongue' (a white coating) may be visible.</li><li><strong>Herpes virus type 6</strong> (roseola infantum) — a mild illness which may be asymptomatic. Fever can last for 3–5 days after which a maculopapular rash appears (when clinical improvement has occurred).</li><li><strong>Rubella</strong> — typically mild and presents with a rash which is maculopapular but not confluent. The rash usually starts behind the ears and on the face, and then spreads down the body (similar to measles). However, the infection is generally mild, and if fever is present it rarely occurs after the first day of the rash. There may be post-auricular and sub-occipital lymphadenopathy. Koplik's spots are not visible. </li><li><strong>Early meningococcal disease</strong> — may present with a maculopapular rash, but becomes purpuric in later stages, and does not fade when a glass is pressed against it. </li></ul></li><li>Other causes of rash to consider that are associated with lymphadenopathy include Kawasaki disease and infectious mononucleosis.</li></ul><!-- end field 296e62c7-62f3-47ee-bec3-e934b5cfc14d --><!-- end item 22a4d551-5a39-4651-ac6d-2c1bc4d70feb -->","topic":{"id":"0ec66249-42a4-5c0d-8a37-f2632ca7acde","topicId":"8b32d801-8035-4957-b21d-fdc0316b697d","topicName":"Measles","slug":"measles","lastRevised":"Last revised in March 2018","chapters":[{"id":"574596e7-391a-5ae2-bf0e-e7a3ac0db310","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"57c95110-4970-53c3-82ca-a0a02f782b1a","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"3968756f-72d2-5af8-a135-89adf3df1291","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"ef04938f-6cd8-5d2b-8031-e63619ffaae6","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"109f46c2-752c-5d34-a3a9-70f89ef6e6d8","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"0ac61cbb-f6a3-5cde-a49e-383cf998866c","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"af44849d-419b-5236-8667-1b06697011e9","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"8aa254cd-c0c4-5ad2-9778-896548b9ae3d","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"6e5a7bc2-88e4-5518-9a27-2c4cc8f96d43","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"e1e3d298-266c-53ca-a837-a43f7b51f000","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"e408b673-3cc9-556a-b3ad-7f2adc0c7e2f","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
