It appears on the face and behind the ears first (when other symptoms tend to be at their most severe), before descending down the body to the trunk and limbs, and forming on the hands and feet last, over the course of about 3–4 days. The rash fades after it has been present on an area for about 5 days, with the total duration of rash being up to 1 week, after which time the person should feel better.</li></ul></li><li>Consider a <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/diagnosis/differential-diagnosis/\">different cause</a> for the rash if the person is likely to have immunity to measles, clinical features are atypical, there is no history of contact with measles or travel to measles-endemic countries, and there are no local outbreaks.</li><li><strong>If there is any suspicion of measles infection, immediately notify the local HPT.

The result is that the positive predictive value of a clinical diagnosis is usually poor, therefore epidemiological factors should also be considered if laboratory results are not available [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2017a</a>].  </li></ul><h4>Immunization status and measles</h4><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the PHE <em>National Measles Guidelines</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2017a</a>].  <ul><li>Vaccination with one dose of the combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine confers about 90% immunity [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2013</a>]. However, vaccination with two doses of the MMR vaccine, as indicated by the UK Childhood Immunization Programme, has an effectiveness of around 95% [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2017a</a>]. </li><li>Contracting measles once confers lifelong immunity [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">Gershon, 2010</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">WHO, 2018</a>]. However, people born after 1990 are not likely to have been exposed to measles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2017d</a>]. This suggests that the people most likely to present with measles are younger people who have not received the MMR vaccine and who have not been previously exposed to the virus. </li></ul></li></ul><h4>Determining the level of contact with measles</h4><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the PHE <em>National Measles Guidelines</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2017a</a>],<strong> </strong>with the definition of significant contact being extrapolated from PHE guidance on viral rash in pregnancy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">HPA, 2011</a>]. </li><li>PHE also notes that epidemiological information is a better predictor of measles than clinical features [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2017a</a>]. </li></ul><h4>Clinical features of measles</h4><ul><li>The clinical features of measles are described in the PHE <em>National Measles Guidelines  </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2017a</a>], <em>Immunisation against infectious disease</em> (the 'Green Book') [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2013</a>], a fact sheet from the World Health Organization [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">WHO, 2018</a>], and expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">Cockbain et al, 2017</a>]. </li></ul><h4>Considering a different cause</h4><ul><li>CKS has based this recommendation on the fact that a number of other diagnoses can have similar presentations (for example roseola, fifth disease, and scarlet fever), so it is important to consider the timing and nature of symptoms to help exclude these if there is doubt about the diagnosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2017a</a>]. <strong> </strong></li></ul><h4>Notification and testing</h4><ul><li>Notification of measles is recommended by PHE in its publications <em>Immunisation against infectious disease </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2013</a>] and <em>PHE</em><em> National Measles Guidelines</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2017a</a>]. Laboratory confirmation is necessary for surveillance and to enable public health action to be taken [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2017a</a>]. Since 1994, most people with clinically-diagnosed measles are not subsequently confirmed to have measles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2013</a>].  <ul><li>Data from Public Health England over a 3-month period from July to September in 2017 showed that of 437 suspected cases of measles, only 36 (8.2%) were laboratory confirmed. From October to December 2017 there were 970 suspected cases, with 149 (15.4%) being confirmed on laboratory investigation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2017e</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2018</a>].  </li></ul></li><li>The information on the tests required is based on the <em>PHE National Measles Guidelines</em>.<strong> </strong>Surveillance, including oral fluid testing of all notifications of suspected measles, is organised by the Virus Reference Department at PHE Colindale which supplies HPTs with oral fluid testing kits [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2017a</a>].  </li></ul><!-- end field 0bcb75b6-8de3-4efa-b93e-849e29fbb9a1 --><!-- end item fa05e12f-a833-432d-b0d5-656310232fe7 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
