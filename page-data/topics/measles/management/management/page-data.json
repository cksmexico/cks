Neonates born to mothers with measles (when the rash appears six days before to six days after birth) require human normal immunoglobulin [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">HPA, 2011</a>].  </li></ul></li><li>The recommendation to seek advice regarding management of immunocompromised people is based on the increased risk of complications in this group such as severe, prolonged illness and pneumonitis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2017a</a>].  </li></ul><h5>Self-care advice</h5><ul><li>For most people, measles is a self-limiting but unpleasant illness. For a person with uncomplicated measles there is no specific treatment or antiviral therapy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">Bester, 2016</a>], therefore experts suggest home management with simple measures including rest and adequate fluid intake [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">Cockbain et al, 2017</a>].  </li><li>Paracetamol and ibuprofen are recommended for the symptomatic relief of measles on the basis that they reduce fever and pain [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">BNF 74, 2017</a>]. <ul><li>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends that, when using paracetamol or ibuprofen in children with fever, treatment should 'continue only as long as the child appears distressed' and does not recommend using antipyretics purely to reduce body temperature in feverish children [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">NICE, 2013</a>]. </li><li>Aspirin is not usually recommended as it has a less favourable adverse effect profile. It is contraindicated in children younger than 16 years of age, because of the risk of Reye's syndrome [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">BNF for Children, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li><li>Guidance from PHE states that people with suspected measles should be kept away from school or nursery for 4 days after the development of rash (the infectious period), and this can reasonably be extrapolated to adults. PHE also advise people with suspected measles to avoid contact with vulnerable people, even though most cases will not be confirmed as measles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2017a</a>]. </li><li>CKS recommends people should be advised to seek urgent advice if they develop any symptoms of a complication of measles based on what it considers to be good clinical practice, expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">Cockbain et al, 2017</a>], and the serious implications of some sequelae of measles:<ul><li>Encephalitis affects about 1 child in every 1000 with measles and may cause permanent brain damage [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">CDC, 2017</a>].  </li><li>Respiratory and neurologic complications cause the deaths of one or two children out of every 1000 with measles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">CDC, 2017</a>].  </li></ul></li></ul><h5>Providing written advice</h5><ul><li>CKS found no evidence on providing patient information, but recommends giving written advice about measles based on what it considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><h5>Follow up and further management</h5><ul><li>The recommendation on follow up is pragmatic, and is based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><h5>Outstanding vaccinations when recovered</h5><ul><li>Vaccination with the combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is recommended when the person has recovered, to provide future protection against mumps and rubella<strong>. </strong>However note that the MMR vaccine is contraindicated in certain groups, for example, immunocompromised people and pregnant women [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/measles/references/\">PHE, 2013</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field ea0dda1c-7a41-4756-82a2-19f92cc10809 --><!-- end item 22dd07ed-ea92-4cbe-9b2d-4ae18c857832 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"eea2295e-b03a-5a31-aa58-074c80e25f90","slug":"admission-referral","fullItemName":"Admission and referral","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 91e04d70-900c-4e75-a005-872f166923a5 --><h3>Which people with suspected measles should be admitted or referred?</h3><!-- end field 91e04d70-900c-4e75-a005-872f166923a5 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 4504d578-3ab6-47d9-8f2f-485869abc27a --><!-- begin field 779df09b-4b17-4dbc-890b-8404eb5a3558 --><ul><li>Seek advice from the local Health Protection Team if the person is:<ul><li>Immunosuppressed.</li><li>Pregnant.</li><li>An infant who is 1 year of age or younger.</li></ul></li><li>Contact the local hospital regarding appropriate isolation before admission.</li><li>Consider admission if the person develops a serious complication of measles, for example:<ul><li>Pneumonia.</li><li>Neurological problems, such as convulsions or encephalitis.</li><li>Children with fever who are otherwise at serious risk.
