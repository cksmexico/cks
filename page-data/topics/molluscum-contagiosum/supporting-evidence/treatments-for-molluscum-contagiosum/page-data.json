To date, no trial has compared watchful waiting with different treatment strategies. Most available trials are small, have poor methodological quality and are not easily replicated to primary care. A Cochrane review concluded that, at present, no reliable evidence-based recommendations can be given for the treatment of non-genital molluscum contagiosum in immunocompetent people. Unless robust evidence emerges for effective and safe treatment, clinicians should consider expectant management (e.g. waiting for spontaneous resolution of the molluscum lesions).</p><ul><li>A Cochrane review (search date: June 2009) included eleven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 495 people. Most of the studies identified could not be included because they were uncontrolled case series, which were open to significant bias, and the results were difficult to evaluate due to the high rate of spontaneous resolution of molluscum contagiosum. The studies that met the inclusion criteria were small, had methodological problems and high drop-out rates, and some did not include intention-to-treat analysis. Although the update from the 2006 review included six new studies, most of which reported on interventions not included previously, the author's conclusions did not change [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/molluscum-contagiosum/references/\">van der Wouden et al, 2009</a>]:<ul><li>One study (n = 30) compared sodium nitrite 5% and salicylic acid 5% under occlusion with salicylic acid 5% alone. A statistically significant higher rate of lesion cure at 3 months was found with sodium nitrite compared with salicylic acid alone. This finding is difficult to interpret as there was no placebo arm.</li><li>Another study (n = 35) found a shorter mean duration to cure in the group treated with iodine plus salicylic acid plaster compared with iodine alone or salicylic acid alone. All participants developed redness of the skin at the treatment site within 3 to 7 days after the start of treatment.</li><li>The other three studies showed no significant difference in complete cure or lesion improvement compared with placebo for topical potassium hydroxide 10% (n = 20), systemic cimetidine, or calcarea carbonica (a homeopathic remedy).</li></ul></li><li>A prospective randomized trial compared four treatments for molluscum contagiosum in 124 children (1–16 years of age). The treatments included curettage, topical cantharidin 0.7%, topical salicylic acid 16.7% with lactic acid 16.7%, and imiquimod 5% [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/molluscum-contagiosum/references/\">Hanna et al, 2006</a>]:<ul><li>The trial suggested curettage was the optimal treatment based on individual and parental satisfaction, number of visits needed, and adverse effects.</li><li>The results of this study need to be considered with caution, as there was no placebo-control group, treatments were initiated in secondary care, and follow up was carried out over the telephone and relied on parental reporting. All children, in addition, received curettage to other lesions. This study did not meet the criteria for the Cochrane review and has limited relevance to primary care. </li></ul></li><li>A number of alternative/complementary therapies are advocated for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum but their effectiveness is unproven.<ul><li>In addition to the trial of a homeopathic remedy included in the Cochrane review, we found a small RCT (n = 31 children) assessing an essential oil. Results from this trial suggest that application of Australian lemon myrtle oil may be of benefit but further research is required [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/molluscum-contagiosum/references/\">Burke et al, 2004</a>].</li></ul></li><li>Since the Cochrane review in 2009 the following randomised controlled trials have been published: <ul><li>One study compared home-treatment with either 10% potassium hydroxide solution with imiquimod 5% cream achieved cure rates of 57% and 77% respectively. Both treatments were deemed safe and effective, although the sample size was relatively small [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/molluscum-contagiosum/references/\">Seo, 2010</a>]. </li><li>Another study found no statistically significant difference between the cure rate of imiquimod 5% cream versus cryotherapy, although the imiquimod was better tolerated in children [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/molluscum-contagiosum/references/\">Al-Mutairi, 2010</a>]. </li><li>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/molluscum-contagiosum/references/\">Kose, 2013</a>] compared the use of compared 10% potassium hydroxide solution with a combination of salicylic and lactic acid, showing that both treatments were effective with success rates of 83·3% and 100% respectively.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 861829ec-75d7-44dd-8718-89cc00441410 --><!-- end item c06c73f0-2a77-450b-8c6e-2010ae7c28c5 -->","topic":{"id":"ca6a0ee0-b108-5948-a385-2ca9fd25f3f2","topicId":"0b781cca-ea92-4b7b-8198-202123cf1f41","topicName":"Molluscum contagiosum","slug":"molluscum-contagiosum","lastRevised":"Last revised in March 2017","chapters":[{"id":"dd0236c1-7131-5ffc-9544-c838a578bb7f","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"c1b8ce66-a218-51e1-aeb2-df50d8bc8235","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"ad5fa2a4-8f1f-515a-bdfe-ad5d3c1218d0","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"628980d1-e848-5813-bf5d-7d8c5ded9093","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"c5c3bba0-b1f8-567a-b3da-bd2020fc62d0","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"fbface41-a9ba-543f-8448-2a1ac5fcda23","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"ba12888d-a27b-570d-9c3e-d444c24e98ca","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"c381e772-090b-54ad-8c8b-948a10596813","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"abc6b2ad-8415-5d64-bf0f-581d003f886c","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"6d3b1c5b-a093-5bc3-87db-2e1aec362c2d","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"4cdc5c27-8f2d-53ee-8963-7a3e75a3d0b0","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
