<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tennis-elbow/references/\">Ma, 2020</a>].<ul><li>Orthoses are recommended in the ACOEM practice guideline, which cites moderate-quality evidence for the use of elbow straps [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tennis-elbow/references/\">Hegmann, 2013</a>].</li><li>A systematic review of multiple interventions for tennis elbow found very low-quality evidence that orthoses are less effective than combination physical therapies at providing pain relief at 6 weeks, but low-quality evidence that orthoses may be more effective at improving the ability to perform daily activities than physiotherapy at 6 weeks follow up [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tennis-elbow/references/\">Bisset, 2011</a>].</li><li>Another systematic review concluded that orthoses provide little or no additional benefit when combined with physiotherapy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tennis-elbow/references/\">Sims, 2014</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The BMJ best practice guide recommends that an inelastic, non-articular, proximal forearm strap should be used for up to 12 weeks in addition to NSAIDs and that if rest, NSAIDs, and bracing fail to improve symptoms after 6 weeks then the person should be reassessed [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tennis-elbow/references/\">BMJ, 2018</a>]. </li><li>CKS notes that the expert opinion of previous external reviewers of this CKS topic was divided as to the benefits of different orthotic devices for tennis elbow, but some felt that forearm bands may be of benefit in the short term, especially if used in combination with physiotherapy. The recommendation to advise people to consider using an orthosis is pragmatic. </li></ul><h5>Corticosteroid injections</h5><ul><li>The recommendation that corticosteroid injections should not be offered routinely for people with tennis elbow is based on evidence that while there are short-term clinical benefits, the long-term outcomes may be less favourable and there may be higher recurrence rates than with physiotherapy or no treatment. <br><ul><li>A systematic review of multiple interventions for tennis elbow found low-quality evidence that corticosteroid injections are likely to be beneficial in providing short-term symptom relief at 6 weeks, with improved pain, function, and global improvement outcomes compared with placebo, orthoses, physiotherapy, and oral NSAIDs [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tennis-elbow/references/\">Bisset, 2011</a>].<ul><li>However, at 1 year follow up, people treated with corticosteroid injection have the same or more symptoms than people who have not received an injection, and some people have worse long-term outcomes compared with those receiving physiotherapy or oral NSAID treatment.</li><li>There was moderate-quality evidence that corticosteroid injections may increase the recurrence rate of tennis elbow compared with physiotherapy and a watch-and-wait approach at 6 weeks follow up.</li></ul></li><li>An additional systematic review of non-surgical treatment for tennis elbow found a short-term benefit for corticosteroid injection, but no differences between injection, oral NSAID, or placebo at 12 months follow up [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tennis-elbow/references/\">Sims, 2014</a>].</li><li>A systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that evaluated injection therapies (botulinum toxin, platelet-rich plasma [PRP], corticosteroid, and autologous blood injection) in people diagnosed with tennis elbow found that corticosteroid injection was the sub-optimal choice. However, the authors acknowledge that the data extracted were the results of the follow up closest to 6 months and while other systematic reviews also reported similar results, there was better performance over the short term (less than 12 weeks), so the effects of corticosteroid injection may have been underestimated [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tennis-elbow/references/\">Dong, 2016</a>].</li><li>A systematic review of overlapping meta-analysis comparing different injection treatments for people with tennis elbow found that corticosteroid injection improves functional outcomes and pain relief in the short term (less than 12 weeks) while autologous blood and PRP were the most effective treatment options in the intermediate term [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tennis-elbow/references/\">Houck, 2019</a>]. <ul><li>Many studies found that although corticosteroid injection exhibits positive short-term outcomes regarding pain relief and functional improvement, the recurrence rate of tennis elbow with this treatment should be taken into consideration.</li><li>One study found that reported recurrence rates after corticosteroid injection were 37% at 6 months and 72% at 6 weeks.</li></ul></li><li>A recent systematic review of RCTs that compared PRP with corticosteroid for treatment of tennis elbow found that local corticosteroid injections demonstrated favourable outcomes compared with those of local PRP treatments during the short-term follow-up period (4 weeks and 8 weeks post-treatment), but at long-term follow up (24 weeks post-treatment) PRP injections had improved pain and function more effectively than corticosteroid injections [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tennis-elbow/references/\">Li, 2019</a>]. </li></ul></li><li>The BMJ best practice guide advises against the use of corticosteroid injections [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tennis-elbow/references/\">BMJ, 2018</a>].<ul><li>While corticosteroid injections have been shown to improve short-term pain relief (4–6 weeks) compared with both placebo and bracing, there is evidence that the long-term outcome following corticosteroid injection for treatment of tennis elbow may be worse than no treatment or physiotherapy alone.</li><li>Despite the fact that some clinicians may recommend corticosteroid injections as a useful adjunct to physiotherapy, one study showed that corticosteroid injections counteract the short-term benefits seen with physiotherapy for lateral epicondylitis.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation to explain the possible adverse effects and long-term implications of corticosteroid injection is pragmatic and what CKS considers good medical practice.</li></ul><h5>Physiotherapy </h5><ul><li>The recommendation to arrange physiotherapy referral is based on the fact that exercises are simple, with minimal potential to cause harm [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tennis-elbow/references/\">Childress, 2013</a>], however, CKS notes there is limited, conflicting evidence on the benefits of physiotherapy in the literature.<ul><li>The ACOEM guidelines state that strengthening exercises are most helpful in the management of chronic elbow pain rather than stretching exercises, particularly if joint movement is preserved, and also cites evidence of modest efficacy for ultrasound treatment for tennis elbow [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tennis-elbow/references/\">Hegmann, 2013</a>].</li><li>A systematic review of multiple interventions for tennis elbow concluded that combination physical therapies, exercise, orthoses, and ultrasound therapy are of unknown clinical effectiveness, as there was insufficient good-quality evidence to draw conclusions [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tennis-elbow/references/\">Bisset, 2011</a>].<ul><li>In the short term, physiotherapy interventions (exercise and mobilization) may be less effective than corticosteroid injections in terms of pain scores and global improvement scores, but physiotherapy shows superior outcomes after 6 weeks.</li></ul></li><li>A systematic review of one clinical review and 12 RCTs found moderate-quality evidence for the short-term effectiveness of stretching plus strengthening exercises compared with ultrasound and massage treatment.
