However, difficulty in effective administration of thickeners to breastfed infants makes their use impractical.</li></ul></li><li>A subsequent Cochrane systematic review (search date 22 November 2016) reviewed the evidence for the effect of feed thickener on GOR in babies up to six months of age [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gord-in-children/references/\">Kwok, 2017</a>]. A total of eight studies (n = 637 infants) met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review, and the infants included in the review were mainly formula‐fed, term infants. <ul><li>Term babies with GOR given feed thickeners had nearly 2 fewer reflux episodes per day (moderate-quality evidence).</li><li>Babies with GOR were also 2.5 times more likely to have no reflux symptoms if feed thickeners were used (low-quality evidence).</li><li>No studies reported information on failure to thrive.</li><li>No major harms were reported in the included studies.</li><li>Due to the limited information available, it was not possible to determine which type of feed thickener is better and whether feed thickeners are useful in babies with GOR who are breastfeeding or preterm. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h5>Stopping treatment at regular intervals</h5><ul><li>NICE recommends stopping treatment with Gaviscon<sup>® </sup>Infant at regular intervals in order to see if symptoms have improved and treatment can be stopped completely.</li><li>As NICE does not give a definition of 'regular intervals', CKS recommends an interval of every 2 weeks. This a pragmatic recommendation and is in line with the trial period suggested by NICE for Gaviscon<sup>® </sup>Infant. </li></ul><h5>Considering a trial of alginate therapy</h5><ul><li>Gaviscon<sup>® </sup>Infant is the only product licensed for children who have not been weaned.</li><li>The NICE GDG identified two small, very low-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared Gaviscon<sup>® </sup>Infant with placebo in children younger than 1 year of age [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gord-in-children/references/\">Miller, 1999</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gord-in-children/references/\">Del Buono et al, 2005</a>].<ul><li>One study showed that the number of regurgitation episodes in a 24-hour period was statistically lower in infants treated with Gaviscon<sup>® </sup>Infant compared with those treated with placebo, but the frequency of regurgitation episodes was not statistically different at 14 days of treatment. No statistical difference was found in the incidence of adverse effects [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gord-in-children/references/\">Miller, 1999</a>]. </li><li>The second study reported that the number of reflux events, the number of acid reflux events, and the total reflux time per hour did not change significantly with Gaviscon<sup>® </sup>Infant treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gord-in-children/references/\">Del Buono et al, 2005</a>]. However, the dosage described in the study appeared to be lower than that recommended by the manufacturer. The NICE GDG also noted that outcomes were based on oesophageal measurements and that no data on regurgitation events was reported.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Considering a trial of a proton pump inhibitors (PPI) or a histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H<sub>2</sub>RA)</h5><ul><li><strong>Trial of a PPI </strong><ul><li>The NICE GDG found evidence from two small, low-quality, placebo controlled RCTs which suggested that compared with placebo, omeprazole is effective for resolving oesophagitis in children aged 3–12 months. The GDG agreed that there is no evidence that one PPI is superior to another and that all PPIs have a similar effect. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Trial of an H<sub>2</sub>RA</strong><ul><li>The NICE GDG found evidence from two small, very low to low-quality trials which suggested that compared with placebo, cimetidine and nizatidine both reduced oesophagitis in children aged 6 months to 12 years old. The evidence also suggested that compared with placebo, H<sub>2</sub>RAs did not reduce the frequency of regurgitation. There was no evidence that one drug was more effective than another. <ul><li>The GDG agree that although there were no trials assessing the effectiveness of ranitidine (the most commonly prescribed H<sub>2</sub>RA), these results could be applied to ranitidine as it is assumed that all H<sub>2</sub>RAs have a similar effect.</li></ul></li><li>A subsequent systematic review assessed the use of PPIs and H<sub>2</sub>RAs in paediatric GORD [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gord-in-children/references/\">de Mattos, 2017</a>]. A total of 23 studies (n = 1598) met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review.<ul><li>Eight studies demonstrated that both PPIs and H<sub>2</sub>RAs were effective against typical manifestations of gastro‐oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and that there was no evidence of benefit in combining both treatments or in routinely prescribing long-term maintenance treatments.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>The NICE GDG states that it was not unreasonable to offer a trial of either an H<sub>2</sub>RA or a PPI for suspected reflux oesophagitis in infants without endoscopic evidence and that the clinical presentation of reflux oesophagitis would usually be obvious.</li><li>CKS recommends prescribing ranitidine (off-label use in children under 3 years of age) or omeprazole (off-label use in children under 1 year of age) as both are available as liquid preparations and can be administered in doses suitable for infants.</li></ul><h5>Managing children aged 1–2 years with heartburn, retrosternal pain, and epigastric pain</h5><ul><li>These recommendations are based on the expert opinion of the NICE GDG and the evidence discussed for PPIs and H<sub>2</sub>RAs.</li></ul><h5>Treatments not recommended in primary care</h5><ul><li>NICE states that metoclopramide, domperidone, or erythromycin should not be used to treat GOR or GORD without seeking specialist advice and taking into account their potential to cause adverse effects. </li></ul><!-- end field 63524136-cbf7-4e2e-b128-ad1c4d1059b4 --><!-- end item 0b1f3708-8ce6-4bcf-b9fe-efb1653cedcb -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
