with regurgitation plus any one of the following: hoarseness, unexplained feeding difficulties, faltering growth, chronic cough, and distressed behaviour.<ul><li>Crying, crying while feeding, and adopting unusual neck postures were judged to indicate that the infant or child was likely to be experiencing some discomfort.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Suspecting GORD in children over 1 year of age</h4><ul><li>NICE found evidence from four observational studies suggesting that symptoms of chest or epigastric pain were useful as indicators of GORD in children over 1 year of age.</li><li>The clinical experience and expert opinion of the guideline development group was that retrosternal pain, including heartburn and epigastric pain, was a common symptom associated with GORD.</li></ul><!--
