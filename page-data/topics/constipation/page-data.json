because of infrequent stools, difficulty passing stools, or the sensation of incomplete emptying.<ul><li>The Rome IV diagnostic criteria for constipation include spontaneous bowel movements occurring less than three times a week.</li></ul></li><li>Chronic constipation usually describes symptoms which are present for at least 12 weeks in the preceding six months.</li><li>Faecal loading/impaction describes retention of faeces to the extent that spontaneous evacuation is unlikely.</li><li>Functional (primary or idiopathic)constipation is chronic constipation without a known cause.</li><li>Secondary (organic) constipation is constipation caused by a drug or underlying medical condition.</li><li>Constipation may occur at any age but is more common in women, the elderly, and during pregnancy.</li><li>Assessment of a person with constipation should include:<ul><li>Any red flag symptoms or signs that may suggest a serious underlying cause, such as colorectal cancer.</li><li>The person’s understanding of constipation and their normal pattern of defecation.</li><li>The frequency and consistency of stools, including symptoms of faecal impaction and/or incontinence.</li><li>Associated rectal, abdominal, or urinary symptoms.</li><li>The severity and impact of symptoms on daily life and functioning.</li><li>Any risk factors or secondary causes.</li><li>Any self-help measures or drug treatments tried.</li><li>Abdominal and internal rectal examination. </li></ul></li><li>The management of chronic constipation should include:<ul><li>Management of any underlying secondary causes, and advice to reduce or stop any drug treatment that may be causing or contributing to symptoms.</li><li>Advice on lifestyle measures, such as increasing dietary fibre, fluid intake, and activity levels.</li><li>Management of any faecal loading and/or impaction first, if present.</li><li>Offering drug treatment with oral laxatives using a stepped approach, such as bulk-forming laxatives first-line, then adding or switching to an osmotic laxative, then adding a stimulant laxative if needed.</li><li>Considering a short-term trial of drug treatment with prucalopride if symptoms persist, if specific prescribing criteria are met.</li><li>Advice on gradually titrating the laxative dose(s) up or down aiming to produce soft, formed stool without straining at least three times per week.</li><li>Arranging regular review, depending on clinical judgement.</li></ul></li><li>If symptoms are ongoing or refractory to laxative treatment, the following may be considered:<ul><li>Blood tests for full blood count, thyroid function tests, HbA1c, and serum electrolytes and calcium, to look for an underlying cause.</li><li>Assessment of whether a defecatory disorder, such as pelvic floor dyssynergia, may be contributory.</li></ul></li><li>Referral to a gastroenterologist or colorectal surgeon for specialist investigations and management should be arranged if:<ul><li>A serious underlying cause such as colorectal cancer is suspected.</li><li>An underlying secondary cause of constipation is suspected, which cannot be managed in primary care.</li><li>Symptoms persist or recur despite optimal management in primary care.</li></ul></li><li>Referral to a local continence service or dietitian should be considered, using clinical judgement.</li></ul><!-- end field 7546fe06-a26c-4986-bcf4-2a4706fffed8 --><!-- end item b1cc3612-1375-46e4-81f3-efd49fbd8f3a
