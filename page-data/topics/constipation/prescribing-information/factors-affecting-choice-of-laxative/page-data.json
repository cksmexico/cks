Must not be taken immediately before bed. Adequate fluid intake is important to reduce the risk of intestinal obstruction. Not recommended for people taking constipating drugs.</td></tr><tr><td>Sterculia</td></tr><tr><td>Methylcellulose</td><td>2–3 days</td><td>Useful first-line choice in adults when it is difficult to get adequate dietary fibre; better tolerated than bran. Must not be taken immediately before bed. Adequate fluid intake is important, to prevent intestinal obstruction. Tablets swell in the mouth on contact with water.</td></tr><tr><td>Wheat or oat bran</td><td>—</td><td>Finely ground bran can be given as bran bread or biscuits, but these are less effective than unprocessed bran. May be unpalatable. Can be added to food or fruit juice. Often poorly tolerated (causes flatulence and bloating) unless increased slowly, and can be difficult to take enough to be effective on its own. Adequate fluid intake is important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Osmotic laxatives</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Lactulose</td><td>2–3 days</td><td>Some people find it sickly sweet and unpalatable. Adequate fluid intake recommended. If used alone in opioid-induced constipation, it often needs to be given in large doses that cause bloating and colic.</td></tr><tr><td>Macrogols (polyethylene glycol)</td><td>2–3 days</td><td>Some people find it difficult to drink the prescribed volume of macrogol. Licensed for use in faecal impaction. Idrolax® does not contain electrolytes. Movicol-Half® contains half the dose and electrolytes of Movicol®.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Surface-wetting laxatives</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Docusate sodium</td><td>12–72 hours</td><td>Probably acts both as a softening agent and a stimulant. May be a useful alternative for people who find it hard to increase their fluid intake.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Stimulant laxatives</strong></td></tr><tr><td>All stimulant laxatives</td><td>—</td><td>Usually taken in the evening to produce a bowel movement the following morning.</td></tr><tr><td>Senna</td><td>8–12 hours</td><td>Licensed only for short-term use. Syrup is unpalatable.</td></tr><tr><td>Sodium picosulfate</td><td>6–12 hours</td><td>Licensed only for short-term use. Syrup is palatable.</td></tr><tr><td>Bisacodyl</td><td>6–12 hours</td><td>Licensed only for short-term use. No syrup available.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Rectal laxatives</strong></td></tr><tr><td>All rectal laxatives</td><td>—</td><td>Easy to use if administered correctly. Timing of effect may be more predictable than with oral laxatives; suppositories may be best given after breakfast to synchronize the effect of the gastro-colic response. Some people find them undignified and unpleasant to use. All unlicensed for the treatment of faecal loading/impaction except Relaxit® micro-enema and arachis oil retention enema.</td></tr><tr><td>Glycerol suppositories (lubricating and weak stimulant)</td><td>15–30 minutes</td><td>Can be used for hard or soft stools. Licensed for occasional use only. Suppositories must be placed alongside the bowel wall so that body heat causes them to dissolve and distribute around the rectum. Suppositories should be moistened before use to aid insertion. are hygroscopic and also act as a lubricant.</td></tr><tr><td>Bisacodyl suppositories (stimulant)</td><td>15 minutes to 3 hours</td><td>Avoid if large, hard stools, as no softening effect. Use for soft stools.</td></tr><tr><td>Sodium phosphate and sodium bicarbonate suppositories (Carbalax®) (effervescent)</td><td>30 minutes</td><td>People should be advised that these suppositories work by an effervescent action.</td></tr><tr><td>Docusate sodium enema (softener and weak stimulant)</td><td>15–30 minutes</td><td>Can be used for hard or soft stools. Correct administration important to prevent damage to rectal mucosa.</td></tr><tr><td>Sodium citrate enema (osmotic)</td><td>5–15 minutes</td><td>Smaller volume (5 mL) than a phosphate enema (130 mL). Useful to remove hard, impacted stools. Correct administration important to prevent damage to rectal mucosa. Licensed for occasional use only. Use with caution in the elderly or people at risk of sodium and water retention.</td></tr><tr><td>Phosphate enema (osmotic)</td><td>2–5 minutes</td><td>Useful to remove hard, impacted stools. Correct administration important to prevent damage to rectal mucosa. Licensed for occasional use only. Use of phosphate enemas are contraindicated in people who have signs of dehydration or significant renal impairment, as there is an increased risk of hypernatraemia, hyperphosphataemia, hypocalcaemia, and hypokalaemia. Risk of rectal gangrene in people who are systemically unwell with a history of haemorrhoids.</td></tr><tr><td>Arachis oil enema (softener)</td><td>Retention enema — used overnight and warmed before use.</td><td>Useful for hard, impacted stools.Should not be used in people with peanut allergy. Licensed for occasional use only.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>5HT4-receptor agonists</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Prucalopride</td><td>—</td><td>May be considered for people in whom treatment with other laxatives has failed to produce an adequate response. Should only be prescribed by clinicians experienced in treating chronic constipation. Licensed for use in women and men.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Data from: </strong><a href=\"http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-hyperlink-id=\"58380f7d-cd64-4d66-9b60-a98d004f2e52\">www.medicines.org.uk</a> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/constipation/references/\">NICE, 2010</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/constipation/references/\">Wald, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/constipation/references/\">BNF 73, 2017</a>]</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- end field 87db9c9d-8475-4b79-a08a-3e6626f6d43e --><!-- end item a46ca97d-b8d6-410e-9ef8-9f4e33c6d167 -->","topic":{"id":"88cc63e8-cda0-5ec1-9109-ae5f4bfa11e3","topicId":"f48a0909-280f-4498-b297-07190c08ba54","topicName":"Constipation","slug":"constipation","lastRevised":"Last revised in November 2020","chapters":[{"id":"652b9d37-6de5-5916-9013-64708458d208","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"602fea2a-9883-51cc-9131-86d54e1113e9","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"eae1c7f5-9d3d-5ff3-a31a-7ff5aa5d2b7f","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"f4d419f5-dfbc-54c7-b9e9-89991528af48","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"f186f2b1-9c45-56b4-a1b7-8f5a64a55f86","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"c2b304c9-3b12-5ee7-81ca-b9ea44de8ad2","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"1f8da0ad-6b3f-5b74-b978-502804c2464e","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"094c26e0-e5de-57ad-8f83-0874e217917b","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"183d066c-25c1-5ad6-91ad-2f1ddaf48844","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"5728a841-2eb8-5a93-928f-78962810589e","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"e8aec3c8-dcd5-529d-b1e6-4e64bf325751","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
