New advice from NICE <em>Human and animal bites: antimicrobial prescribing guidance</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bites-human-animal/references/\">NICE, 2020</a>] has been incorporated. These changes relate primarily to the advice on when to prescribe antibiotics for human and animal bites, the number of days advised for antibiotic prescriptions for treatment and for prophylaxis, and the indications for secondary care referral for people suffering bites. The choice of antibiotics has also been revised, clarithromycin has been removed and co-trimoxazole has been added as an alternative first-choice oral antibiotic for children under 12 years for penicillin allergy or if co-amoxiclav is unsuitable. This is an off-label use of co-trimoxazole. </p><p><strong>October 2018 </strong>— minor update. Adverse effects updated within prescribing information - metronidazole. </p><p><strong>February 2018 </strong>— minor update. New guidance from Public Health England regarding Rabies: administration of vaccine and immunoglobulin added to new evidence section.</p><p><strong>February</strong><strong><strong> </strong>2018 </strong>— revised. A literature search was conducted in December 2018 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key RCTs published since the last revision of the topic. The topic now covers dog and cat bites and the scenario on pre-exposure rabies risk has been removed. There have been structural changes to streamline the scenarios. Antibiotic choices for prophylaxis and treatment of infected bite wounds have been simplified and antibiotic doses added to prescribing information. There have been changes to the recommendations on closing bite wounds in primary care.</p><!-- end field 037622c5-beaa-4818-bba1-447c05db164d --><!-- end item 3eef070b-6a33-42ef-aae5-afbf3c60c241 -->","topic":{"id":"66885481-1c78-50d7-bd40-cee6daf3a22b","topicId":"1f9ba5f4-d4ca-402b-857f-1ef0227e6eaa","topicName":"Bites -
