However, tetanus after a human bite is extremely rare.</li><li>Rabies is very rare in the UK as there is no indigenous rabies in terrestrial animals (although bats are a risk). It usually occurs after a person is bitten or scratched by an animal with rabies. </li><li>The circumstances under which the bite occurred should be documented and the wound examined. The risk of tetanus and blood-borne virus infection (for human bite wounds) or rabies (for animal bite wounds) should also be assessed.</li><li>Managing a bite involves:<ul><li>Removal of any foreign bodies (for example teeth) from the wound.</li><li>Encouraging a wound that has just occurred to bleed, unless it is already bleeding freely.</li><li>Thorough irrigation with warm, running water.</li><li>Considering the need for debridement.</li><li>Advising appropriate analgesia (ibuprofen or paracetamol) for pain relief, if required.</li><li>Referring to Accident and Emergency for further assessment and management if wound closure is thought to be necessary.</li><li>For a human bite, prescribing prophylactic antibiotics if the skin is broken and drawn blood or involves high-risk areas of skin or the person is at risk of wound infections. </li><li>For an animal bite, prescribing prophylactic antibiotics if a cat bite has broken the skin and the wound could be deep or a dog or other animal bite has penetrated vital tissues, caused significant tissue damage or is contaminated or involves high-risk areas of skin or the person is at risk of wound infections.  </li><li>Empirical antibiotic treatment if the bite wound is infected.</li><li>Seeking immediate advice from a consultant in infectious diseases for anyone considered to be at risk of HIV or hepatitis B.</li><li>Considering the need for tetanus and rabies prophylaxis.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field a3edd594-805e-4de2-a0e7-37ab64e773b2 --><!-- end item bd5feb77-f54d-431c-8948-0d4b3d313fb6 -->","topic":{"id":"66885481-1c78-50d7-bd40-cee6daf3a22b","topicId":"1f9ba5f4-d4ca-402b-857f-1ef0227e6eaa","topicName":"Bites -
