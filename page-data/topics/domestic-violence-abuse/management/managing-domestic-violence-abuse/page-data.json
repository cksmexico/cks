However, the person should be informed that there are limits to confidentiality and that in exceptional circumstances (such as if there is reason to suspect children are at risk) safeguarding and protection will always take precedence over confidentiality [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/domestic-violence-abuse/references/\">BMA, 2014</a>]. </li><li>The BMA guidance on <a data-hyperlink-id=\"b028c321-2b87-4940-8c15-a90300be22dc\" href=\"https://www.bma.org.uk/advice/employment/ethics/mental-capacity/vulnerable-adults-and-confidentiality\">Vulnerable adults and confidentiality</a> highlights that challenging situations can arise for health professionals where adults who are subject to abuse do not want confidential information disclosed, even where this would be the best way to ensure they are protected from harm. Decisions are particularly difficult where adults retain capacity under the terms of the Mental Capacity Act (2005) but health professionals may believe that they are not making a free and informed choice (for example as a result of pressure from or fear of the abuser).

However, there are other services, for example, the police, probation, youth justice, substance misuse, mental health, and other health services, that may have additional information about the perpetrator. There are also professionals who know more about the impact of neglect and trauma on children than a mother could be expected to know [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/domestic-violence-abuse/references/\">DH, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li><li>An expert reviewer of this CKS topic pointed out that parents might be fearful of disclosing abuse for fear that their child/ children could be taken away, and advises that it is worth emphasizing that a referral is generally about support for the family to keep children safe and not about taking the children away from their families.</li></ul><h5>Managing children and young people affected by domestic violence and abuse</h5><ul><li>NICE recommends that there should be clear referral pathways to local services that can support children and young people affected by domestic violence and abuse. These services should match the child's developmental stage, and the interventions should be timely and continue over a long enough period to achieve positive lasting effects [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/domestic-violence-abuse/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>].</li><li>Evidence identified by CAADA showed that specialist children’s services are vital in reducing the impact of domestic violence and abuse.

The evidence also showed that [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/domestic-violence-abuse/references/\">CAADA, 2014</a>]:<ul><li>These specialist children’s services give young people a voice and improve their safety, recovery, health, and wellbeing.

The perpetrator may not know that their partner or family member has disclosed domestic violence and abuse to a GP or nurse, nor will they necessarily know if their case is being discussed at the multi-agency risk assessment conference (MARAC). When the perpetrator is not aware of a disclosure of domestic violence and abuse, an accidental discovery increases the risk to the person being abused and their children.</li></ul><h5>Information and advice</h5><ul><li>The Department of Health and the BMA warn that it is not the job of a healthcare professional to advise a person experiencing domestic violence and abuse on what action they should take, as ill-informed advice could have serious consequences for all those involved. The professional is, however, expected to ask the person if they would like to be referred to specialist services for further treatment and/or support.

In the opinion of the Department of Health, a referral pathway that does not include specialist services risks dealing with such health issues alone and may allow the perpetrator to avoid responsibility for their domestic violence and abuse behaviours with increased risk of harming. Although mental health problems and substance misuse may be factors in abusive behaviour, they are not the sole causes of perpetrators’ behaviour (for example some perpetrators may have issues relating to past traumatic experiences) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/domestic-violence-abuse/references/\">DH, 2017</a>].<ul><li>A range of specialist services may be available locally or regionally based on a number of different therapy approaches, including a structured domestic violence perpetrator programme (DVPP) offering a series of weekly sessions using education and challenge, and examining the person’s behaviours and beliefs about gender and relationships to change their behaviour.</li><li>In the UK, perpetrator services are run by prisons and the criminal justice system or as community-based programmes, usually by third sector organizations.

However, the person should be informed that there are limits to confidentiality and that in exceptional circumstances (such as if there is reason to suspect children are at risk) safeguarding and protection will always take precedence over confidentiality [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/domestic-violence-abuse/references/\">BMA, 2014</a>].</li><li>The BMA guidance on <a data-hyperlink-id=\"b028c321-2b87-4940-8c15-a90300be22dc\" href=\"https://www.bma.org.uk/advice/employment/ethics/mental-capacity/vulnerable-adults-and-confidentiality\">Vulnerable adults and confidentiality</a> highlights that challenging situations can arise for health professionals where adults who are subject to abuse do not want confidential information disclosed, even where this would be the best way to ensure they are protected from harm. Decisions are particularly difficult where adults retain capacity under the terms of the Mental Capacity Act (2005) but health professionals may believe that they are not making a free and informed choice (for example as a result of pressure from or fear of the abuser). The BMA stresses the legal and ethical requirement to respect the choices of competent adults [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/domestic-violence-abuse/references/\">BMA, 2017</a>].</li></ul><h5>Sharing information</h5><ul><li>The legalities of information sharing (and confidentiality) for a healthcare professional are complex [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/domestic-violence-abuse/references/\">BMA, 2014</a>].</li><li>The BMA advises that [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/domestic-violence-abuse/references/\">BMA, 2014</a>]:<ul><li>Each trust, health authority, and clinical commissioning group should have information sharing policies to help inform healthcare professionals, and these should be followed.</li><li>People have the right to object to information they provide in confidence being disclosed to a third party in a form that identifies them, even if this is to someone who might provide essential healthcare.<ul><li>Where the person is competent to make such a choice and the consequences of that choice have been fully explained, their wishes should be respected.</li><li>It is very important in the context of domestic violence and abuse that the person is involved in all stages of the decision-making process and that they retain as much control as possible over disclosures of information. They may feel threatened by the thought of others knowing about their situation and may be concerned that the disclosure of what has occurred may lead to further violence and abuse.</li></ul></li><li>However, healthcare professionals must consider whether other members of the household are also at risk and whether continued or more severe abuse could result in permanent damage. <ul><li>The decision to disclose is based partly on a balancing of several moral imperatives, including the risk and likelihood of harm if no disclosure is made, the risk and likelihood of harm if a third party disclosure is made, and the need to maintain the trust of the person.</li><li>Because there is no broad consensus of how harm to people should be evaluated or from whose perspective it should be judged, the BMA advises that, where feasible, healthcare professionals should try to envisage the seriousness of the potential harm from the viewpoint of the person likely to suffer it.</li><li>While a refusal to disclose information by a competent adult can be overridden in order to protect a third party (such as a child or vulnerable adult who may be in the household), it becomes more difficult where an adult refuses to disclose information in order to protect themselves. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field c8a807e7-6e4a-4ae1-9a14-a90300dff786 --><!-- end
