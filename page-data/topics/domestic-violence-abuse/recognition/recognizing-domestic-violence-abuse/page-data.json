even if the person chooses not to disclose at the present time, knowing that a healthcare professional is aware of the issues and is supportive will build trust and encourage them to disclose at a later date [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/domestic-violence-abuse/references/\">DH, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The NICE guideline highlights that there is an ongoing debate about the effectiveness and desirability of screening and enquiry (routine or targeted) to identify people who are experiencing domestic violence and abuse. Although there is insufficient evidence to recommend this practice in healthcare settings, asking people routinely about domestic violence and abuse in some specialized healthcare settings is considered good practice by professionals in those fields [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/domestic-violence-abuse/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>].
