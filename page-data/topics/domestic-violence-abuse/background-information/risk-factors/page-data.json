showed that the odds of being a victim of domestic violence were two-fold higher for those with a physical disability and three-fold higher for those with a mental-illness-related disability [<a

others. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Other risk factors for domestic violence and abuse include:</strong><ul><li>Sexual orientation — about 80% of trans people (including cross-dressers, transgender and transsexual people, and other gender-variant people) experience emotional, physical, or sexual abuse from a partner or ex-partner, and 38.4% of bisexual, gay, and lesbian people class themselves as having experienced domestic violence and abuse [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/domestic-violence-abuse/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>]. </li><li>Escalation of violence — previous domestic violence and abuse is the clearest indicator that further domestic violence and abuse will occur. Research shows that 35% of households have a second incident<strong> </strong>within five weeks of the first [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/domestic-violence-abuse/references/\">DH, 2013</a>].</li><li>Cultural factors — these include language barriers between partners, immigration status, isolation, and cultural beliefs (for example being from a female genital mutilation-practicing community) [<a

across all social classes, it has an economic gradient.</li></ul></li><li><strong>The role of alcohol or drug misuse in domestic violence and abuse is poorly understood </strong>[<a

Crime in England and Wales 2010/11</em>, 21% of people experiencing partner abuse in the past year thought the perpetrator was under the influence of alcohol, and 8% under the influence of illicit drugs [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/domestic-violence-abuse/references/\">Home Office, 2011</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field
