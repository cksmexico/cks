The diuretics used in the trials were potassium-sparing diuretics (one trial), loop diuretics (five trials), thiazides (one trial), combination diuretics (two trials), and various or unspecified diuretics (four trials). When compared to placebo, in three trials (n = 202) there was a statistically significant reduction in mortality. In two trials (n = 169) there was a statistically significant reduction in heart failure-related hospital admission, and in four trials (n = 91) there was a statistically significant improvement in exercise capacity [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">Faris et al, 2012</a>].</li></ul><h5>Prescribing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to prescribe an ACE-inhibitor to all people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HF-REF) is based on evidence of efficacy in reducing mortality and morbidity in guidelines from SIGN [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">SIGN, 2016</a>], NICE [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>], and the European Society of Cardiology [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">European Society of Cardiology, 2012</a>].</li><li>The recommendation not to initiate an ACE-inhibitor in a person in whom there is a clinical suspicion of haemodynamically significant valve disease until the valve disease has been assessed by a specialist, is based on expert opinion in the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Prescribing angiotensin-II receptor antagonists (AIIRAs)</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to give an AIIRA to people who are intolerant of ACE-inhibitors is based on a systematic review comparing the use of AIIRAs with placebo in people with heart failure. Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the review and showed that AIIRAs significantly reduced the rate of hospitalization due to heart failure, and the composite end-point of cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisation due to heart failure. There was no statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li><li>Evidence from comparative trials indicates that there is no difference in efficacy between AIIRAs and ACE-inhibitors. A meta-analysis of 17 trials (12,469 participants) in which five AIIRAs were studied (losartan, candesartan, valsartan, irbesartan, and eprosartan) concluded that AIIRAs were not superior to ACE-inhibitors at improving clinical outcomes (rates of hospitalization or death) in people with heart failure [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">Jong et al, 2002</a>]. However, ACE-inhibitors are preferred to AIIRAs because, overall, placebo-controlled trials of ACE-inhibitors have found reductions in mortality, whereas placebo-controlled trials of AIIRAs have not. A Cochrane systematic review assessed the efficacy of AIIRAs compared with placebo in heart failure and did not demonstrate a reduction in mortality or total morbidity as measured by total hospitalizations involving 22 studies (17,900 participants) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">Heran et al, 2012</a>].</li></ul><h5>Prescribing beta-blockers</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to give a beta-blocker to all people with heart failure is consistent with evidence from large RCTs that beta-blockers reduce mortality and morbidity associated with heart failure [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">SIGN, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">European Society of Cardiology, 2012</a>].</li><li>The NICE guideline development group recommends that a beta-blocker licensed for treating heart failure should be prescribed. Bisoprolol, carvedilol, and nebivolol are the only beta-blockers licensed for treating heart failure. Although there is evidence that metoprolol reduces mortality, it is not licensed for use in heart failure [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li><li>NICE reviewed the use of beta-blockers versus placebo in people aged over 65 years of age with chronic heart failure. Four RCTs were included (n = 4909) and demonstrated a significant reduction in all-cause mortality and sudden death. There were no significant differences in all-cause hospitalization, quality of life, or adverse events [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Explaining the benefits of treatment and expected timescale of symptom improvement</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to explain the benefits of treatment and the anticipated timescale of improvement is based on information in the European Society of Cardiology guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">European Society of Cardiology, 2012</a>].</li></ul><h5>Sequencing treatment with beta-blockers and ACE-inhibitors</h5><ul><li>NICE recommends that treatment may be initiated first with either a beta-blocker or an ACE-inhibitor and advises using clinical judgement when deciding which to initiate first [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>]. This is based on evidence from one RCT (n = 1010) which found that people with heart failure had similar outcomes regardless of which treatment was started first. The decision on which drug to start first depends on the clinical status of the person (for example blood pressure, heart rate, angina, arrhythmias, and other comorbidities).</li><li>Offering people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction ACE-inhibitors (or an AIIRA licensed for heart failure if there are intolerable adverse effects with ACE-inhibitors) and beta-blockers licensed for heart failure, which are gradually increased up to the optimal tolerated or target dose with monitoring after each increase, is a NICE chronic heart failure quality standard [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2011</a>].</li></ul><h5>Referral if the person is still symptomatic</h5><ul><li>The recommendation that people who remain symptomatic despite optimal treatment with a diuretic, an ACE-inhibitor (or AIIRA), and a beta-blocker should be referred for specialist assessment and management is based on information in the NICE guideline <em>Chronic heart failure: national clinical guideline for diagnosis and management in primary and secondary care </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Prescribing an antiplatelet drug</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to prescribe an antiplatelet drug for people with heart failure and atherosclerotic arterial disease (including coronary heart disease) is based on information in the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Prescribing a statin</h5><ul><li>There is considerable evidence of the value of statin treatment in atherosclerotic disease. Two large placebo-controlled trials (n = 5011 and n = 4574) comparing statin treatment with placebo in chronic heart failure did not demonstrate a significant reduction in cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular hospitalization, or all-cause mortality [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">European Society of Cardiology, 2012</a>].</li></ul><h5>Optimally manage any comorbidities and precipitating factors</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to ensure optimal management of comorbidities and precipitating factors is based on information in the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>] and the guideline from the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">Yancy et al, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h5>Screening for depression and anxiety</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to screen for depression is based on evidence in the European Society of Cardiology guideline, which states that depression is common and associated with a worse clinical status, poor prognosis, and may contribute to poor drug adherence and social isolation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">European Society of Cardiology, 2012</a>]. The NICE guideline recommends considering a diagnosis of depression in all people with heart failure and reassessing psychological status following heart failure treatment because if the symptoms have improved no further specific treatment for depression is required [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>]. The recommendation to screen for anxiety is pragmatic and based on what CKS considers to be good medical practice.</li></ul><h5>Supervised exercise-based rehabilitation programme</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to offer a supervised exercise-based rehabilitation programme designed for suitable people with heart failure is based on information in the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>] and is a NICE chronic heart failure quality standard [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2011</a>].<ul><li>A small RCT found that 6 years after participation in a residential rehabilitation programme, people with chronic heart failure had slightly better outcomes than the control group, maintained exercise capacity, and engaged in activities that exceed the minimal amount recommended by guidelines for cardiovascular health [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">Mueller et al, 2007</a>].</li><li>Two RCTs in people with chronic heart failure suggest that intensive aerobic exercise may be more effective than less intensive exercise and weight training [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">Feiereisen et al, 2007</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">Wisloff et al, 2007</a>].</li><li>A large RCT (n = 1159) found that exercise training resulted in a non-significant reduction in the risk of death (from any cause) or hospitalization, and a small but statistically significant improvement in self-reported health status [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">Flynn et al, 2009</a>].</li><li>A systematic review on the effects of moderate-high intensity resistance training in people with chronic heart failure found 10 trials, all with methodological flaws, which concluded that the evidence on benefits was weak and inconsistent but that there was no evidence of harm [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">Spruit et al, 2009</a>].</li><li>The British Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation Cardiac Rehabilitation Standards document has defined that cardiac rehabilitation is associated with a reduction in morbidity, a 28-56% reduction in unplanned admissions, improves functional capacity and perceived quality of life, and supports early return to work and the development of self-management skills [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">BACPR, 2012</a>].</li><li>A Cochrane overview (148 RCTs in 98,093 participants) showed exercise-based rehabilitation (in low-risk people) had no impact on mortality but reduced hospital admissions and improved health-related quality of life [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">Anderson and Taylor, 2014</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Immunization advice</h5><ul><li>The recommendations regarding vaccination are based on information in the SIGN [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">SIGN, 2016</a>] and NICE guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Giving information and advice</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to give information regarding diagnosis and management including self-care advice is based on expert opinion in the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Assessing nutritional status</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to advise people to eat healthily and to maintain a healthy weight is based on expert opinion in the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>] and the European Society of Cardiology guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">European Society of Cardiology, 2012</a>].</li></ul><h5>Discussing advance care planning and advance decisions</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to offer a discussion regarding advance care planning and advance decisions is based on information in a position statement from the Heart Failure Association of the European Society of Cardiology Palliative care in heart failure [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">Jaarsma et al, 2009</a>] which states that treatment preferences, living wills, and advanced directives should be discussed with people and their families at an early stage of the disease, and information in the NICE guideline which states that palliative needs of people and carers should be identified, assessed, and managed at the earliest opportunity [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Arranging follow-up</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to arrange appropriate follow-up is based on information in the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Advice for women of child-bearing age</h5><ul><li>These recommendations are based on information in the guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology <em>Guidelines on the management of cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">European Society of Cardiology,
