The diuretic-only group had 50 participants, who used a variety of diuretics. The quality of life score improved with statistical significance in this group, but performance on the 6-minute walking tests and most echocardiographic measures of cardiac function did not change with statistical significance [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">Yip et al, 2008</a>].</li></ul><h5>Seeking specialist advice</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to seek specialist advice in patients who do not respond to diuretic treatment is based on information in the NICE guideline because there is considerable uncertainty about additional drug treatments for people with HFPEF, as there is uncertainty about optimal drug treatments for HFPEF. NICE reviewed the evidence on ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists (AIIRA), and beta-blockers for treating people with HFPEF and concluded that evidence is insufficient to support their use [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Prescribing an antiplatelet drug</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to prescribe an antiplatelet drug for people with heart failure and atherosclerotic arterial disease (including coronary heart disease) is based on information in the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Prescribing a statin</h5><ul><li>There is considerable evidence of the value of statin treatment in atherosclerotic disease. Two large placebo-controlled trials (n = 5011 and n = 4574) comparing statin treatment with placebo in people with chronic heart failure did not demonstrate a significant reduction in cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular hospitalization, or all-cause mortality [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">European Society of Cardiology, 2012</a>].</li></ul><h5>Optimally manage any comorbidities and precipitating factors</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to ensure optimal management of comorbidities and precipitating factors is based on information in the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>] and the guideline from the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">Yancy et al, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h5>Screening for depression and anxiety</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to screen for depression is based on evidence in the European Society of Cardiology guideline, which states that depression is common and associated with a worse clinical status, poor prognosis, and may contribute to poor drug adherence and social isolation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">European Society of Cardiology, 2012</a>]. The NICE guideline recommends considering a diagnosis of depression in all people with heart failure and reassessing psychological status following heart failure treatment because if the symptoms have improved no further specific treatment for depression is required [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>]. The recommendation to screen for anxiety is pragmatic and based on what CKS considers to be good medical practice.</li></ul><h5>Supervised exercise-based rehabilitation programme</h5><ul><li>The

class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2011</a>].<ul><li>A small RCT found that 6 years after participation in a residential rehabilitation programme, people with chronic heart failure had slightly better outcomes than the control group, maintained exercise capacity, and engaged in activities that exceed the minimal amount recommended by guidelines for cardiovascular health [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">Mueller et al, 2007</a>].</li><li>Two RCTs in people with chronic heart failure suggest that intensive aerobic exercise may be more effective than less intensive exercise and weight training [<a class=\"bibliography-reference

href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">Wisloff et al, 2007</a>].</li><li>A large RCT (n = 1159) found that exercise training resulted in a non-significant reduction in the risk of death (from any cause) or hospitalization, and a small but statistically significant improvement in self-reported health status [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">Flynn et al, 2009</a>].</li><li>A systematic review on the effects of moderate-high intensity resistance training in people with chronic heart failure found 10 trials, all with methodological flaws, which concluded that the evidence on benefits was weak and inconsistent but that there was no evidence of harm [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">Spruit et al, 2009</a>].</li><li>The British Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (BACPR) Cardiac Rehabilitation Standards document has defined that cardiac rehabilitation is associated with a reduction in morbidity, a 28-56% reduction in unplanned admissions, improves functional capacity and perceived quality of life, and supports early return to work and the development of self-management skills [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">BACPR, 2012</a>].</li><li>A Cochrane overview (148 randomised controlled trials in 98,093 participants) showed exercise-based rehabilitation (in

href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">Jaarsma et al, 2009</a>] which states that treatment preferences, living wills, and advanced directives should be discussed with people and their families at an early stage of the disease, and information in the NICE guideline which states that palliative needs of people and carers should be identified, assessed and managed at the earliest opportunity [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Arranging follow-up</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to arrange appropriate follow-up is based on information in the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Advice for women of childbearing age</h5><ul><li>These recommendations are based on information in the guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology <em>Guidelines on the
