person with suspected chronic heart failure are based on expert opinion in the guidelines from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) <em>Management of chronic heart failure </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">SIGN, 2016</a>], the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) <em>Chronic heart failure: national clinical guideline for diagnosis and management in primary and secondary care </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>], the European Society of Cardiology<em> Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure 2012</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">European Society of Cardiology, 2012</a>] and NICE NG 106 <em>Chronic Healt Failure in Adults: diagnosis and management </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</p><h4>Admit or refer if severe symptoms</h4><ul><li>The recommendation to admit or refer a person with severe symptoms is based on the fact that acute heart failure may be present (either as a new event or a deterioration of chronic heart failure) and require immediate medical attention. This is based on the European Society of Cardiology<em> Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure 2012 </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">European Society of Cardiology, 2012</a>], and is pragmatic based on what CKS considers to be good medical practice.</li></ul><h4>Referral of pregnant or postpartum women</h4><ul><li>The recommendation to admit or seek immediate medical advice for pregnant or postpartum women is based on expert opinion that a high index of suspicion is needed to avoid late diagnosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy in the European Society of Cardiology <em>Guideline on the management of cardiovascular disease during pregnancy </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">European Society of Cardiology, 2011</a>]. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guideline <em>Cardiac disease and pregnancy </em>recommends a risk assessment should be carried out early in pregnancy by a specialist obstetrician, cardiologist, and anaesthetist [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">RCOG, 2011</a>].</li></ul><h4>Measuring natriuretic peptides and referral for specialist assessment and echocardiography</h4><ul><li>Natriuretic peptides are hormones secreted in increased amounts in heart disease or when the load on any chamber is increased. Measurement of natriuretic peptide levels helps determine the likelihood of the presence of heart failure, the need and urgency of referral for specialist assessment, and confirmation of the diagnosis by echocardiography.</li><li>Good evidence supports the use of N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-pro-BNP) tests to exclude heart failure [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>]. The thresholds for NT-pro-BNP are based on levels from the NICE guideline. </li><li>The referral threshold of a high natriuretic peptide level to be seen within 2 weeks is based on information that these people have a high probability of having heart failure and a poor prognosis so early treatment is important [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li><li>The referral threshold of natriuretic peptide to be seen within 6 weeks is based on information in the NICE Guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li><li>Specialist assessment for confirmation of the diagnosis of heart failure is recommended in the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>], because it is important to assess severity, aetiology, precipitating factors, and type of cardiac dysfunction. </li></ul><h4>Arranging an ECG in all people</h4><ul><li>The recommendation to perform an ECG to evaluate possible risk factors and/or alternative diagnoses such as atrial fibrillation (AF) is based on the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>] and the European Society of Cardiology 2012 guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">European Society of Cardiology, 2012</a>].</li><li>Information in the SIGN guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">SIGN, 2016</a>] states that it is unusual for a person with chronic heart failure to have a normal ECG. The ECG abnormalities in chronic heart failure include pathological Q waves, left bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, atrial fibrillation, or non-specific ST and/or T wave changes.</li></ul><h4>Other tests to consider</h4><ul><li>The recommendation to arrange other tests to evaluate other possible diagnoses that may present in a similar manner is based on information in the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].  </li><li>The recommendation to consider performing a chest X-ray is based on the SIGN guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">SIGN, 2016</a>], the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>], and the European Society of Cardiology guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">European Society of Cardiology, 2012</a>] which state that a chest X-ray may be useful to identify an underlying pulmonary condition and may show signs supportive of a diagnosis of heart failure (such as cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion, or pleural effusion).</li><li>The recommendation to consider blood tests is based on information in the guideline from the European Society of Cardiology [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">European Society of Cardiology, 2012</a>]. This states that routine biochemical investigation is important to determine whether renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockade can be initiated safely. The guideline recommends that a full blood count be performed to exclude anaemia which can mimic or aggravate heart failure. Thyroid function testing is recommended as thyroid disease can mimic or aggravate heart failure. A glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) is recommended to exclude diabetes mellitus. Liver function tests are recommended as these may be abnormal in heart failure, and are important when prescribing some drug treatments.</li><li>The recommendation to perform urinalysis is based on expert opinion in the SIGN and NICE guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">SIGN, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to consider pulmonary function tests in selected people (such as those with comorbid lung disease) is based on expert opinion in the SIGN and NICE guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">SIGN, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>] that they may be useful to assess other causes of dyspnoea.</li></ul><h4>Assessing and managing any underlying causes</h4><ul><li>This recommendation is based on information in the SIGN guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">SIGN, 2016</a>] which states that identifying the cause is important as different causes may require different specific management.</li><li>Expert opinion in the NICE guideline states that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should not be initiated in a person with a clinical suspicion of haemodynamically significant valve disease, until the valve disease has been assessed by a specialist [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field 3f4d1592-4e5b-4302-8cba-da0c5e594f2c --><!-- end item 23019a98-998e-4ce0-94af-b43963240f06 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
