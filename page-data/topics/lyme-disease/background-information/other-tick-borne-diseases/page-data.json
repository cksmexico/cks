They include:<ul><li><strong>Anaplasmosis (granulocytic ehrlichiosis) </strong>— occurs in the US and Europe, but is rare. It is characterized by high fever, chills, severe headache, and generalized muscle and joint pains 5–21 days after infection.</li><li><strong>Babesiosis </strong>— most commonly occurs on the east coast of the US, but also sporadically in other parts of the world. It has similar clinical features to malaria, including fever, chills, sweats, muscle and joint pains, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. It can be fatal, particularly if the person is immunocompromised.</li><li><strong>Q fever </strong>— this uncommon infection by the organism <em>Coxiella burnetii </em>is usually acquired by humans from the inhalation of infected dust or exposure to the amniotic fluid or placenta of infected sheep, cattle, and goats. It is only very rarely acquired through tick bites.</li><li><strong>Tick-borne encephalitis </strong>— a tick-borne, flu-like, viral illness that starts 2–28 days after a tick bite. It can progress to meningitis, encephalitis, radiculitis, and myelitis, and can be fatal. It is common in central and eastern Europe, but is never acquired in the UK.</li><li><strong>Rickettsioses </strong>— symptoms begin 6–10 days after a tick bite, and include fever, headache, muscle pain, rash, and local lymphadenopathy. There is a characteristic appearance at the site of the tick bite (known as an inoculation eschar), and a diffuse, generalized maculopapular rash. Rickettsioses is not acquired in the UK; it occurs in parts of Europe and in Asia and Africa.</li><li><strong>Tularaemia </strong>— a severe illness characterized by a sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, lymphadenopathy, muscle pains, malaise and fatigue 1–21 days after infection. It is not acquired in the UK, but can be caught in other parts of Europe and in North America.</li><li><strong>Tick-borne relapsing fever </strong>— mostly seen in Africa, and parts of South America and Asia, it is never acquired in the UK. It is characterized by the sudden onset of high fever, severe headache, rash, and symptoms and signs of septicaemia. Following the initial illness, recurrent bouts of fever occur.</li><li><strong>Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI) </strong>— has a similar rash to erythema migrans, and is only seen in the US.</li><li><strong>Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) </strong>— a viral illness endemic in many countries of Eastern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, but with no reported cases of transmission in the UK. The illness begins abruptly with fever, muscle pains, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes, and photophobia. Nausea, vomiting, and sore throat may also occur, with diarrhoea and abdominal pain.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/lyme-disease/references/\">Wormser et al, 2006</a>;
