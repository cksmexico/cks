Hair regrowth is stimulated at the site of injection, but the effect is usually temporary lasting a few months only. Adverse effects include local pain at the injection site, skin atrophy, and skin depigmentation.</li><li>Oral corticosteroids — there is conflicting evidence regarding the benefits of oral corticosteroids, for example for the treatment of extensive or rapidly progressive disease. They may be given as continuous or pulsed treatment, and may take the form of a six-week tapering course. Possible benefits should be weighed against potentially serious adverse effects, and the risk of relapse after stopping treatment.</li><li>Topical immunotherapy — this may be offered in specialist centres to people with extensive patchy hair loss. The aim is to induce a low-grade allergic contact dermatitis which alters the immune response and induces hair regrowth. This is achieved by sensitizing the person to a potent contact allergen initially applied to a small area of the scalp, which is then applied at increasing concentrations. Adverse effects may include blistering, lymphadenopathy, and skin pigmentation changes.</li><li>Psoralen plus ultraviolet A light therapy (PUVA) — there is limited and conflicting evidence for the use of light therapy in the treatment of alopecia areata. Adverse effects include nausea, skin pigmentation changes, and an increased risk of skin cancer.</li><li>Immunosuppressive drugs — oral ciclosporin or methotrexate may be offered to people with extensive alopecia areata, but trial evidence is very limited with small patient numbers and uncontrolled trials. Drug use is limited by potentially severe adverse effects, and relapse may occur after stopping treatment.</li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/alopecia-areata/references/\">Harries et al, 2010</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/alopecia-areata/references/\">Messenger et al, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/alopecia-areata/references/\">Hordinsky, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/alopecia-areata/references/\">Spano, 2015b</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/alopecia-areata/references/\">Strazzulla, 2018b</a>]</p><!-- end field 40e3f4f0-267d-44e7-9bb9-a87e00e12bfe --><!-- end item 227b3c0a-88de-4a4c-9a7a-a87e00e1266d -->","subChapters":[]},{"id":"57f5a1e5-c568-5011-8ab1-98faa5a74f04","slug":"basis-for-recommendation-3bc","fullItemName":"Basis for recommendation","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 5a5cdd3b-3763-4c11-9274-e5d8a7dcdee1 --><h4>Basis for recommendation</h4><!-- end field 5a5cdd3b-3763-4c11-9274-e5d8a7dcdee1 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 3bcae283-5b00-49b5-8929-a4183d1b14c3 --><!-- begin field 657fcb51-efe1-4e95-a78c-06668883e2e3 --><p>The recommendations on management are largely based on expert opinion in the British Association of Dermatologists' (BAD) <em>Guidelines for the management of alopecia areata 2012</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/alopecia-areata/references/\">Messenger et al, 2012</a>], a Cochrane systematic review <em>Interventions for alopecia areata (Review)</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/alopecia-areata/references/\">Delamere et al, 2008</a>], and expert opinion in review articles on alopecia areata [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/alopecia-areata/references/\">Harries et al, 2010</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/alopecia-areata/references/\">Hordinsky, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/alopecia-areata/references/\">Hordinsky, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/alopecia-areata/references/\">Spano, 2015a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/alopecia-areata/references/\">Spano, 2015b</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/alopecia-areata/references/\">Xu, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/alopecia-areata/references/\">Strazzulla, 2018b</a>].</p><h5>Providing information and advice</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to give information and advice on the natural history of the condition and treatment options is largely based on the BAD guidelines, which note that although a number of treatments may induce hair regrowth in alopecia areata, no treatment has been shown to alter the longterm course of the disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/alopecia-areata/references/\">Messenger et al, 2012</a>].</li></ul><h5>Option of no treatment</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on considering no current treatment are based on expert opinion in the BAD guidelines, which states that no treatment is the best option in many cases, as there is a high probability of spontaneous remission and the condition does not adversely affect general physical health.
