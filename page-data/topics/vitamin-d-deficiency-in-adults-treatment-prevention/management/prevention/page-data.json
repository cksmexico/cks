However, the evidence on musculoskeletal health outcomes (osteomalacia, falls, and muscle strength and function) was considered to be suggestive of a beneficial effect of vitamin D and was therefore used as the basis for setting the DRVs.</li><li>Based on the evidence for musculoskeletal outcomes, which showed an increase risk of poor musculoskeletal health at serum hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations less than 25 nmol/L, SACN recommends a vitamin D reference nutrient intake (RNI) of 400 international units (IU [10 micrograms]) daily for all adults in the UK, including those as increased risk of vitamin D deficiency.</li><li>An increment to the RNI was not considered necessary for people at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency because the recommendation for the RNI to be applicable throughout the year is to take account of people with minimal sunshine exposure, including those most at risk. </li><li>According to the SACN report:<ul><li>These recommendations are a precautionary approach to protect the most vulnerable groups in the population, take account of variable exposure to sunshine and diet, and ensure coverage of 97.5% of the population throughout the year. Although most people would be expected to synthesise vitamin D during the summer months, serum 25(OH)D concentrations below 25 nmol/L have been observed in a proportion of some population groups in the UK during the summer months. Since it is not possible to identify these people, the recommendation is applicable to the UK population throughout the year. </li><li>Although achievement of the proposed RNI by the UK population would lead to an increase in mean/median vitamin D intakes of the UK population, it is unlikely that this would lead to vitamin D intakes at the upper end of the distribution reaching levels that might pose a risk of adverse effects. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p style=\"margin-left:-6.0pt;\"><strong>Not routinely monitoring serum vitamin D levels</strong></p><ul><li>This recommendation is extrapolated from the SACN vitamin D report [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">SACN, 2016</a>] and the National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) guideline <em>Vitamin D and bone health: a practical clinical guide for patient management </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">National Osteoporosis Society, 2013</a>].<ul><li>SACN does not recommend routine monitoring of serum vitamin D levels during long-term supplementation with vitamin D.</li><li>Expert opinion in the NOS guideline is that routine monitoring of serum 25(OH)D levels is unnecessary for people on long-term maintenance doses of vitamin D (up to 2000 IU a day)<strong>.</strong></li></ul></li></ul><h5>Ensuring adequate calcium intake </h5><ul><li>Adequate levels of both vitamin D and dietary calcium are needed to ensure optimum serum calcium levels, and it is important to ensure that both are maintained to the prevent long-term adverse effects on the bones [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">DTB, 2006</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">Kennel et al, 2010</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">BMJ, 2016</a>]. People who are unable to take sufficient dietary calcium will therefore require long-term calcium supplements [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">NHS Wales, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">BNF 72, 2016</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to consider the need for supplemental calcium only when an adequate dietary intake of calcium cannot be achieved is extrapolated from expert opinion in the National Osteoporosis Guideline Group (NOGG) guideline <em>Osteoporosis: clinical guideline for prevention and treatment</em>, which states that it may be prudent to increase dietary calcium intake and use vitamin D alone where the use of calcium and vitamin D supplementation might otherwise be considered.
