This can be affected by:<ul><li>Season, time of day, and weather conditions — solar UV levels are highest in the UK summer months (between March and October) and around midday (between 11am and 3pm), but are reduced by cloud cover [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">SACN, 2016</a>].</li><li>Latitude — UVB radiation is sufficient for year round vitamin D synthesis at latitudes below 37º N (for example in Athens, Seville, and Sicily). At higher latitudes (including all of the UK), vitamin D is not synthesized in the winter months. However, the extent of the effect of latitude on vitamin D synthesis in the UK summer months may be relatively small compared with other factors.</li><li>Habit of dressing — wearing clothes that cover the entire body and face reduces skin exposure to sunlight.</li><li>Sunscreen use — some experts suggests that heavy sunscreen use reduces vitamin D production [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">BMJ, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">SACN, 2016</a>]. However, evidence identified by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) suggests that although sunscreens can significantly reduce the production of vitamin D under very strictly controlled conditions, their normal usage does not generally prevent vitamin D synthesis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">SACN, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The amount of vitamin D synthesized in the skin also depends on the efficiency of cutaneous synthesis. This can be affected by:<ul><li>Age — lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations have been reported in older people compared with younger people. This is possibly because the amount of 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) present in the skin decreases with increasing age (the age at which this becomes a limiting factor if there is adequate sunlight exposure is unclear). It has also been suggested that the low 25(OH)D levels could be due to the fact that older people tend to wear more clothes, spend more time indoors, and are more likely to develop conditions that can affect the activation or bioavailability of vitamin D (such as reduced kidney or liver function). </li><li>Having darker skin — melanin, the pigment that gives skin its brown or black colour, absorbs a proportion of the UVB radiation needed for cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D. People with dark skin may therefore need more sunlight exposure to produce the same amount of vitamin D as people with lighter skin [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Other possible causes of vitamin D deficiency include:</strong><ul><li>Inadequate dietary and supplemental vitamin D<ul><li>In the winter months in the UK (from October to March), sunlight contains very little of the UVB needed to synthesize vitamin D. It therefore has to be obtained from body stores (from UVB exposure in the summer months) and dietary sources, including natural foods, fortified foods, and food supplements.</li><li>It is difficult to get enough vitamin D from <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/background-information/definition/\">food sources</a> alone because they are limited and often do not contain enough vitamin D to satisfy daily requirements.</li></ul></li><li>Conditions that impair the absorption of vitamin D<ul><li>Intestinal malabsorption syndromes (such as coeliac disease, cystic fibrosis, and Crohn's disease) impair the absorption of dietary vitamin D, leading to decreased bioavailability.</li><li>Obesity (body mass index [BMI] greater than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) is associated with lower vitamin D levels, although the reason is unclear. One theory is that because vitamin D is fat soluble and is readily stored in adipose tissue, it could be sequestered in body fat compartments of obese people, leading to reduced bioavailability [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">Wortsman et al, 2000</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">Vanlint, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">BMJ, 2016</a>].</li><li>Severe liver failure is associated with fat malabsorption [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">BMJ, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li><li>Conditions that impair the activation of vitamin D<ul><li>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) or kidney failure impairs the production of sufficient 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]<sub>2</sub>D).</li><li>Liver disease can also impair the activation of vitamin D. When more than 90% of the liver fails, it is incapable of producing enough 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">BMJ, 2016</a>].</li><li>Inherited enzyme disorders are rare and include mutation of renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1 alpha-hydroxylase (which causes pseudovitamin D-deficiency rickets).</li></ul></li><li>Other conditions<ul><li>Nephrotic syndrome can cause urinary loss of vitamin D.</li><li>Cancers (malignant or benign) can cause hypophosphataemia and low levels of serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D.</li></ul></li><li>Certain drugs <ul><li>Drugs that reduce fat absorption (for example orlistat) can lead to a decreased bioavailability of vitamin D [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">Preston, 2015</a>].</li><li>Antiepileptic drugs (especially carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin), colestyramine, rifampicin, corticosteroids, and highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) can actively destroy vitamin D by activating the catabolism of both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D. </li><li>See the section on <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/prescribing-information/high-dose-vitamin-d/#drug-interactions\">Drug interactions</a> for more information. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">Bordelon et al, 2009</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">Pearce and Cheetham, 2010</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">Hull and Anastasiadis, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">BMJ, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">SACN, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>]</p><!-- end field 863ffa73-c55d-4e8e-920e-b146540d3a29 --><!-- end item cd7b452e-2443-4e79-9b07-e8afd6ae2192 -->","topic":{"id":"3a69f47b-0066-5318-ba94-a0776d1f423d","topicId":"77754106-b68f-4177-9b0c-fcfcc0541b9a","topicName":"Vitamin D deficiency in adults -
