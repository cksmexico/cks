Rich sources include cod liver oil (this also contains vitamin A which can be harmful in high doses and should be avoided in pregnancy) and oily fish (such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines). Egg yolk, meat, offal, milk, and mushrooms contain small amounts.</li><li>Vitamin D-fortified foods include fat spreads and some breakfast cereals and yoghurts.</li><li>Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplements are synthesized by UVB irradiation of 7-DHC from sheep wool, and vitamin D<sub>2</sub> by UVB irradiation of ergosterol from fungi.  </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Dietary and cutaneous vitamin D are biologically inactive and require enzymatic conversion to the active metabolite </strong><strong>1, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]<sub>2</sub>D).</strong><ul><li>Vitamin D is converted in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), the main circulating metabolite. This is then converted to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D in the kidneys and other tissues.</li><li>The production of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D is regulated by the action of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) on the kidneys: a rise in PTH levels stimulates the synthesis of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D and vice versa.</li></ul></li><li><strong>The best indicator of vitamin D exposure (from the diet and sunlight) is the serum concentration of 25(OH)D.</strong> This is because it has a long half-life in the circulation (about 2–3 weeks) and is not subject to tight homeostatic control. As a result, it provides an indication of vitamin D availability over recent weeks.<ul><li>Serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D concentration is not a suitable indicator of vitamin D exposure because it has a short half-life (less than 4 hours); it is homeostatically regulated; the plasma concentrations are not directly regulated by vitamin D intake (but by other factors, such as plasma PTH levels); and even in the presence of severe vitamin D deficiency, plasma concentrations may be normal or even elevated as a result of upregulation of cytochrome P450 27B1 (the enzyme which catalyzes the hydroxylation of 25[OH]D to 1,25[OH]<sub>2</sub>D).</li></ul></li><li><strong>In the UK the evidence identified by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN)</strong> suggests that the risk of poor musculoskeletal health is increased at serum 25(OH)D concentration below 25 nmol/L [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">SACN, 2016</a>]. See the section on <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/management/prevention/\">Prevention of vitamin D deficiency</a> for more information.</li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">National Osteoporosis Society, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">PHE and FSA, 2014a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">BMJ, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">SACN, 2016</a>]</p><!-- end field 414e2ff6-942b-4ceb-8e56-bdef15f6d0db --><!-- end item fb78fadd-7e55-424e-9196-07fde7e6b07e -->","topic":{"id":"3a69f47b-0066-5318-ba94-a0776d1f423d","topicId":"77754106-b68f-4177-9b0c-fcfcc0541b9a","topicName":"Vitamin D deficiency in adults -
