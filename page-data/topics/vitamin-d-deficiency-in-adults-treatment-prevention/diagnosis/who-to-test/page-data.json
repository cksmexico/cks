people with [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">National Osteoporosis Society, 2013</a>]:<ul><li>Bone diseases that may be improved with vitamin D treatment — NOS found good evidence that correcting vitamin D deficiency is essential in osteomalacia and may be beneficial in osteoporosis.</li><li>Bone diseases, prior to specific treatment where correcting vitamin D deficiency is appropriate — NOS recognizes that there are bone diseases (such as Paget’s disease) for which correcting vitamin D deficiency is recommended before drug treatment. It is also important that people receiving potent antiresorptive osteoporosis treatments (denosumab or zoledronate) are not vitamin D deficient before starting treatment, to reduce the risk of developing hypocalcaemia.</li><li>Musculoskeletal symptoms that could be attributed to vitamin D deficiency — NOS states that although the symptoms of vitamin D deficiency are vague and it can be difficult to ascertain whether a low serum 25(OH)D level is causal or a surrogate marker (for example of poor nutrition or a lack of outdoor activity), it is reasonable to test people suspected of having symptoms caused by osteomalacia and people who have chronic widespread pain.</li></ul></li><li>NICE recommends testing if there are symptoms of vitamin D deficiency and if there is a clinical reason to do so (for example osteomalacia or a fall) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>]. NICE also recommends testing vitamin D levels in people who are considered to be at very high risk of vitamin D deficiency (for example those with very low exposure to sunlight). However, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) report <em>Vitamin D and health</em>, which NICE advises their guideline should be used in conjunction with, recommends daily vitamin D supplements for all people in the UK, including people thought to be at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency, but does not recommend vitamin D testing <em>prior</em> to supplementation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">SACN, 2016</a>].</li><li>Although uncommon, symptoms of hypoglycaemia are also diagnostic factors for vitamin D deficiency [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">BMJ, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h4>How to test</h4><ul><li>Experts agree that measuring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) is the best indicator of vitamin D status. This is because it reflects cutaneous and dietary sources of vitamin D, has a fairly long half-life (2–3 weeks), and is not subject to tight homeostatic control. As a result, it gives an indication of vitamin D availability over recent weeks [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">National Osteoporosis Society, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">BMJ, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-treatment-prevention/references/\">SACN, 2016</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field 272fa117-567e-40a0-9302-7ccf4a3c4b8b --><!-- end item 8932ebea-3270-4de0-b8cb-f0dc1ff79606 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
