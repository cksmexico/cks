and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends a stepped approach in the management of generalized anxiety disorder:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Step 1 — For all people with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD):</strong><ul><li><strong>Assess the severity of GAD. Ask about:</strong><ul><li>The number, severity, and duration of symptoms.</li><li>The degree of distress and functional impairment.</li><li>Consider using validated assessment tools such as the <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/generalized-anxiety-disorder/diagnosis/diagnosis/#generalized-anxiety-disorder-questionnaire\">GAD-7</a> questionnaire, to help determine GAD severity.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Enquire about the following factors which may affect the development, course, and severity of GAD:</strong><ul><li>Comorbid depressive disorder, or other anxiety disorder — if present, treat the disorder which is most severe first, as this is more likely to improve overall functioning. For more information,  see the CKS topics on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression/\">Depression</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder/\">Obsessive-compulsive disorder</a>, and <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/\">Post-traumatic stress disorder</a>.</li><li>Comorbid medical conditions — ensure that any comorbid conditions are optimally managed, as this is likely to improve overall functioning.</li><li>Comorbid substance misuse — bear in mind that substance misuse can be a complication of GAD, that non-harmful substance use should not be a contraindication to the treatment of GAD, and that harmful and dependent substance misuse should be treated first as this may lead to significant improvement in the symptoms of GAD. For more information, see the CKS topics on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/alcohol-problem-drinking/\">Alcohol - problem drinking</a> and <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/\">Opioid dependence</a>.</li><li>Environmental stressors such as physical or emotional trauma, employment or financial worries, poor living conditions, or problems with interpersonal relationships — discuss practical solutions to stressors contributing to GAD.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Note: </strong>If the person is exhibiting marked functional impairment, severe co-morbid depression or other mental health disorder, GAD has been assessed as severe, or other concerns have been raised, consider assessing their <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/generalized-anxiety-disorder/management/management/#risk-of-suicide\">risk of suicide</a>.</li><li><strong>Consider the person's history of mental health disorders, and past experience of and response to treatments </strong>— this information should guide clinical judgement on what level of intervention may be required.</li><li><strong>Provide written material about the nature of GAD and its treatment options:</strong><ul><li> <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg113/ifp/chapter/About-this-information\" data-hyperlink-id=\"2ab17fd4-64fb-49ee-8247-a98e001f15a6\">NICE</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/expertadvice/problemsdisorders/anxiety,panic,phobias.aspx\" data-hyperlink-id=\"21688f9e-70a2-4339-9da4-a98e001f1604\">Royal College of Psychiatrists</a> have produced information leaflets that include this information.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Arrange active <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/generalized-anxiety-disorder/management/management/#monitoring\">monitoring</a></strong> of the person's symptoms, functioning, and response to treatment (if applicable) at intervals as detailed below, and/or determined by clinical judgement.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Step 2 — For people without marked functional impairment who have not improved following step 1 interventions, offer low-intensity psychological interventions based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) principles, such as:</strong><ul><li>Individual non-facilitated self-help — should include suitable written or electronic materials that the person works through systematically over a period of at least 6 weeks. Minimal therapist contact, for example an occasional short telephone call of no more than 5 minutes, is required.</li><li>Individual guided self-help — should include suitable written or electronic materials, and be supported by a trained practitioner who facilitates the programme and reviews progress and outcome. This usually consists of five to seven weekly or fortnightly face-to-face or telephone sessions, each lasting 20–30 minutes</li><li>Psychoeducational groups — should have an interactive design and encourage observational learning through presentations and self-help manuals. They should have a ratio of approximately one trained practitioner to 12 participants and usually consist of six weekly 2 hour sessions. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Step 3 — For people with marked functional impairment <em>or</em> GAD that has not improved following step 2 interventions, offer either:</strong><ul><li><strong>An individual high-intensity psychological intervention such as CBT or applied relaxation, or drug treatment. </strong>Note: the choice between psychological intervention or drug treatment should be guided by the person's preference, as there is no evidence that one is more effective than the other in the treatment of GAD.</li><li><strong>Psychological interventions</strong> — Inform the person that response to psychological treatment is not immediate and that a prolonged course is usually needed to maintain an initial response.</li><li><strong>Drug treatment </strong>— first-line treatment is usually with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) such as sertraline, paroxetine,  or escitalopram. A selective serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), such as duloxetine or venlafaxine is a possible alternative. Pregabalin can be offered if SSRIs or SNRIs are contraindicated or not tolerated. For more information, see the relevant sections in <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/generalized-anxiety-disorder/prescribing-information/\">Prescribing information</a>.<ul><li>Discuss the potential for adverse effects and withdrawal symptoms before drug treatment is initiated. Explain that adverse effects early in treatment with an SSRI or SNRI may include increased anxiety, agitation, and sleeping problems.</li><li><a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/generalized-anxiety-disorder/management/management/#monitoring\">Review</a> the effectiveness and adverse effects of the drug every 2 to 4 weeks during the first 3 months of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. Dose adjustment may be required. Bear in mind that an absence of clinical benefit within four weeks suggests that a response to unchanged treatment is unlikely and that the full efficacy of the drug may take up to 12 weeks to be realised.</li><li><strong>Be aware that in a minority of people aged under 30 years of age, SSRIs and SNRIs are associated with an increased risk of suicidal thinking and self-harm.</strong> Anyone in this age group receiving an SSRI or SNRI should therefore be seen within 1 week of first prescribing, and the risk of <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/generalized-anxiety-disorder/management/management/#risk-of-suicide\">suicidal thinking</a> and self-harm should be monitored weekly for the first month. </li><li>Benzodiazepines should <em>not </em>be offered for the treatment of GAD in primary care, except as a short-term measure during crises. For more information, see the section on Prescribing information.</li><li>Do <em>not</em> offer an antipsychotic for the treatment of GAD in primary care.</li></ul></li><li><strong>If a pregnant woman with GAD requires step 3 management</strong><strong>:</strong><ul><li>Ideally, a high-intensity psychological intervention should be offered first.</li><li>If drug treatment is considered necessary in the first trimester (such as in a women for whom psychological intervention has proved ineffective), the potential risks and benefits should be discussed. For example, it is still unclear whether SSRIs (and SNRIs) used in the first trimester may slightly increase the risk of infant congenital heart defects above the background rate of approximately 1 in 100. There are insufficient data to permit an evidence-based assessment of the fetal safety profile of pregabalin. This must be balanced against the risks to both mother and fetus if the maternal condition is not optimally controlled. Consider discussion with a specialist in obstetrics for women who may require SSRI or SNRI medication in pregnancy. </li><li>If a woman with GAD who is stabilised on current treatment reports a pregnancy, the risk of relapse must be taken into account when considering discontinuing or switching medication. In cases where drug treatment is continued in pregnancy, the lowest effective dose should be used. Consider discussion with a specialist in obstetrics for women who may require changes to their SSRI or SNRI medication in pregnancy. </li><li>Treatment with an SSRI or SNRI after around 20 weeks of pregnancy may raise the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) and/or can lead to neonatal withdrawal. Women using these medications should therefore be advised to give birth at a unit with the facilities to provide treatment and support for these conditions.</li><li>Patient information leaflets on use of drugs to treat GAD in pregnancy are available at <a href=\"http://www.medicinesinpregnancy.org/\" data-hyperlink-id=\"3bc18fb1-4efb-4fcc-88de-a98e001f178d\">medicinesinpregnancy.org</a>.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Step 4 — Refer for specialist treatment (including complex drug and/or psychological interventions, possibly administered on an inpatient basis, or via multi-agency teams), people with severe anxiety and marked functional impairment, <em>and/or</em> GAD that has not improved following step 3 interventions, <em>and/or</em> those exhibiting, or at risk of:</strong><ul><li>Self-harm. </li><li>Self-neglect.</li><li>A significant comorbidity such as substance misuse, personality disorder, or complex physical health problem.</li><li>Suicide — refer urgently (same day) to the crisis resolution and home treatment team if the person is at high risk of suicide.

Follow local policy when referring to specialist mental health services.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>For all people with GAD being managed in primary care, also consider providing self-care advice relating to:</strong><ul><li>Sleep hygiene — such as going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, eliminating alcohol after 6 pm, avoiding caffeine after 3 pm, and getting out of bed if unable to fall asleep to avoid negative associations with the sleep environment.
