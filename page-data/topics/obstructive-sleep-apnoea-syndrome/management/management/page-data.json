The authors propose that OSAS may independently increase cardiovascular risk, however there were confounding cardiovascular risk factors already present in the study population which may reduce the strength of this association. It concludes that more studies are required to identify if good management of OSAS reduces cardiovascular events [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obstructive-sleep-apnoea-syndrome/references/\">Loke et al, 2012</a>].</li><li>A meta-analysis of six prospective cohort studies (n = 5953) found that moderate to severe OSAS is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The results also indicated that OSAS may be an independent risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obstructive-sleep-apnoea-syndrome/references/\">Wang et al, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h5>Monitoring blood pressure</h5><ul><li>The recommendation on monitoring blood pressure is based on a review article in the European Respiratory Journal, <em>Recommendations for the management of patients with obstructive sleep apnoea and hypertension </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obstructive-sleep-apnoea-syndrome/references/\">Parati et al, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h5>Encouraging compliance with treatment</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the SIGN guideline <em>Management of obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS) in adults </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obstructive-sleep-apnoea-syndrome/references/\">SIGN, 2003</a>].</li></ul><h5>Advice on driving</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on information from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) guidance for medical practitioners, <em>At a glance guide to the current medical standards of fitness to drive </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obstructive-sleep-apnoea-syndrome/references/\">DVLA, 2014</a>], and the British Thoracic Society position statement <em>Driving and Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA)/Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS) </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/obstructive-sleep-apnoea-syndrome/references/\">British Thoracic Society, 2014</a>].</li></ul><h5>Information on support groups</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><!-- end field 5cc6580b-4d32-4438-8546-0f3e397fecbb --><!-- end item 5e296d6d-68b0-4c62-a5a4-65d22fde4b68 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"adac4e0f-04b3-52c8-90c8-cc7b729d40ef","slug":"advice-on-driving","fullItemName":"Advice on driving","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 002bc0d6-2658-4733-94b6-27a7170bffba --><h3>What advice should I give about driving?</h3><!-- end field 002bc0d6-2658-4733-94b6-27a7170bffba -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item c5758d2e-f090-4721-be80-ba74979801b1 --><!-- begin field a698cec4-2861-4377-b126-2b9dffe283f1 --><ul><li>The British Thoracic Society (BTS) gives the following advice regarding driving for people with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS):<ul><li>The person does not need to stop driving, or inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) if:<ul><li>They are being investigated for, or have a diagnosis of, sleep apnoea, but do not experience symptoms of daytime sleepiness that are of a severity likely to impair driving.</li></ul></li><li>The person should inform the DVLA (but not cease driving) if:<ul><li>They are successfully using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or an intra-oral device.
