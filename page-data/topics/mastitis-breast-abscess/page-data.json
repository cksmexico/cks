It is usually associated with lactation ('lactational' or 'puerperal mastitis'), but it can also occur in non-lactating women ('non-lactational mastitis').</li><li>A breast abscess is a localized collection of pus within the breast. It is a severe complication of mastitis, although it may occur without apparent preceding mastitis. Other complications of mastitis can include sepsis, scarring, and recurrent mastitis.</li><li>In lactating women, milk stasis is usually the primary cause of mastitis.<ul><li>The accumulated milk causes an inflammatory response which may or may not progress to infection.</li><li>The most common organism associated with infective mastitis in lactating women is <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.</li></ul></li><li>In non-lactating women, mastitis is usually accompanied by infection, which can be categorized as either central/subareolar or peripheral.<ul><li>Central/subareolar infection is usually secondary to periductal mastitis (a condition where the subareolar ducts are damaged and become infected).</li><li>Peripheral infection (less common) is associated with diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, trauma, corticosteroid treatment, and granulomatous mastitis (a rare inflammatory disease of the breast), but often there is no obvious underlying cause.</li><li>The most common organisms associated with infective mastitis in non-lactating women are <em>S. aureus</em>, enterococci, and anaerobic bacteria (such as <em>Bacteroides</em> and anaerobic streptococci).</li></ul></li><li>Mastitis should be suspected if a woman has:<ul><li>A painful breast.</li><li>Fever and/or general malaise.</li><li>A tender, red, swollen, and hard area of the breast, often in a wedge-shaped distribution.</li></ul></li><li>It is not possible to distinguish clinically between infectious and non-infectious mastitis. However, infection is more likely if the woman has a nipple fissure that is infected, or if in a lactating woman:<ul><li>Symptoms do not improve, or are worsening, after 12–24 hours despite effective milk removal.</li><li>Bacterial culture in breast milk is positive.</li></ul></li><li>A breast abscess should be suspected if the woman has:<ul><li>A history of recent mastitis.</li><li>A painful, swollen lump in the breast, with redness, heat, and swelling of the overlying skin.</li><li>Fever and/or general malaise.</li></ul></li><li>If a breast abscess is suspected, the woman should be referred urgently to a general surgeon for confirmation of the diagnosis and management.</li><li>If there is an underlying mass or breast cancer is suspected, an urgent 2-week wait referral should be arranged.</li><li>First-line management of a woman with mastitis not requiring urgent admission or referral includes:<ul><li>Offering reassurance that the breast should return to normal following appropriate treatment.</li><li>Advising on measures to relieve pain and discomfort, such as the use of simple analgesics and applying a warm compress to the breast.</li><li>Encouraging breastfeeding women to continue feeding if possible, including from the affected breast.</li><li>Identifying and managing predisposing factors for mastitis, including poor infant attachment, nipple damage, smoking, and/or an underlying breast abnormality.</li><li>Prescribing oral antibiotics if indicated.</li><li>Offering appropriate advice on measures to prevent recurrence, such as encouraging good breastfeeding technique and maintaining good hygiene.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 6a0cd091-d719-4444-bee0-d3dccda8ec89 --><!-- end item e610bcd0-be95-432b-851f-3a44c726cbf4 -->","topic":{"id":"612445a9-31b6-5130-bb99-4389c0f9c4af","topicId":"8dd98aac-dd7a-4981-bb01-5e666b4686b6","topicName":"Mastitis and breast abscess","slug":"mastitis-breast-abscess","aliases":["Breast abscess and mastitis"],"chapters":[{"id":"d054cbf1-e596-5afd-8a75-f3d051c621dc","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"de83cb42-8301-5164-81a9-f0c4ab5a83c2","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"610b1eb8-dd62-5e7e-b3bf-deb28c7072aa","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"c44cbf7c-02c4-5674-abb6-1c6be6131e3b","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"9d333c13-3643-5811-9a29-a919983994aa","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"f993c606-c828-51da-a43a-6029a7e07f40","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"a4f11480-406f-5573-9e6b-b2747a513a11","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"5020b6cc-9441-50c0-b8dd-94fcf8bdf761","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"948e09e3-ff32-5344-a06f-e0a9331eff4f","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"e253dff2-3341-5c3a-8c2c-a8c5c9d27491","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"7a7fe239-eefb-5a7a-936c-c1c01d919b6e","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
