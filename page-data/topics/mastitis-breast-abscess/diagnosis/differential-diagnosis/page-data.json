The breasts feel hot, heavy, and hard (and are not shiny, oedematous, or red). For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/\">Breastfeeding problems</a>.</li><li><strong>Engorged breasts </strong>— this either occurs in the first few days after an infant is born (when the breasts overfill with milk [primary engorgement]) or when feeding is less frequent, or the infant's demands have decreased (secondary engorgement). It is usually bilateral, and the breasts are enlarged, swollen, and painful. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/\">Breastfeeding problems</a>.</li><li><strong>A blocked duct </strong>— there is a painful lump in the breast, and the skin overlying the lump may be red. There is usually no fever. For more information, see the section on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/diagnosis/diagnosis-of-breast-pain/\">Clinical features of a blocked duct</a> in the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/\">Breastfeeding problems</a>.</li><li><strong>Galactocoele </strong>— typically there is a smooth, rounded, and painless swelling in the breast. Milky fluid is discharged from the nipple when pressed. Systemic symptoms are absent.</li><li><strong>Infection of the mammary ducts </strong>— there is a deep burning, aching, or shooting pain in the breast that is worse during or just after breastfeeding. There may be accompanying pain radiating down the arm or into the back. There is usually no fever or malaise.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Conditions that cause breast pain that are <em>not</em> associated with lactation</strong> <strong>include:</strong><ul><li><strong>Breast cancer </strong>— this includes ductal cancer (characterized by breast pain and/or bloody discharge), inflammatory breast cancer (characterized by rapid onset of warmth of the breast, diffuse redness, and oedema causing an orange skin [peau d'orange] appearance), and Paget's disease of the nipple (characterized by an itchy, red rash on the nipple, burning sensation in the breast, and bleeding from the nipple). For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-cancer-recognition-referral/\">Breast cancer - recognition and referral</a>.</li><li><strong>Duct ectasia </strong>— a harmless, age-related breast change which causes the milk duct under the nipple to become blocked or clogged with a thick, sticky substance. It is usually asymptomatic, but there may be discharge from the breast (non-bloody or bloody), a lump behind the nipple (which is just scar tissue or a dilated duct), and/or an inverted nipple.</li><li><strong>Cellulitis </strong>— acute bacterial infection of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. It presents with an acute onset of red, painful, hot, swollen, and tender skin, with possible blister or bullae formation. Fever, malaise, nausea, and rigors may accompany or precede the skin changes. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/cellulitis-acute/\">Cellulitis - acute</a>.</li><li><strong>Fibroadenosis </strong>— describes a group of benign conditions affecting the breast. Clinical features include breast pain, increase in breast size, and breast nodularity.</li><li><strong>Ruptured breast cyst </strong>— may present with breast pain and a palpable mass.</li><li><strong>Necrotizing fasciitis of the breast </strong>— a rare and potentially fatal soft tissue infection of the breast. It can occur after trauma, around foreign bodies in surgical wounds, or can be idiopathic. Clinical features include painful enlargement of the breast, breast ulceration, foul-smelling discharge from the breast, and fever.</li><li><strong>Fat necrosis of the breast </strong>— a firm, round lump (or lumps) may be seen on the affected breast. This is usually painless but may feel tender or even painful. The skin around the lump may look red, bruised, or occasionally dimpled. Rarely the nipple of the affected breast may be retracted.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Conditions that cause nipple pain include:</strong><ul><li><strong>Poor infant attachment </strong>— this is the most common cause of nipple pain and/or damage. For more information, see the section on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/diagnosis/diagnosis-of-nipple-pain/\">Nipple pain/soreness due to attachment issues</a> in the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/\">Breastfeeding problems</a>.</li><li><strong>Candidal infection of the nipple </strong>— this often follows antibiotic treatment but may also be a predisposing factor for recurrent mastitis. For more information, see the section on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/diagnosis/diagnosis-of-nipple-pain/\">Clinical features of candidal infection</a> in the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/\">Breastfeeding problems</a>.</li><li><strong>Blanching of the nipple </strong>— this is due to the pressure of suckling, may cause pain, and is related to poor breastfeeding technique.</li><li><strong>Eczema of the nipple </strong>— presents as a red, itchy rash with a well-demarcated edge. For more information, see the section on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/diagnosis/diagnosis-of-nipple-pain/\">Clinical features of eczema or dermatitis</a> in the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/\">Breastfeeding problems</a>.</li><li><strong>Bacterial infection of the nipple </strong>— may present as a yellow discharge from the nipple, or a sloughy appearance.

Pain is severe, debilitating, and throbbing, and breastfeeding is very painful.
