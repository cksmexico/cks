prognosis of ankle sprains.</strong><ul><li>Following an acute lateral ankle sprain, pain decreases rapidly within the first two weeks after injury, but up to 40% of people develop chronic ankle instability [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sprains-strains/references/\">Vuurberg, 2018</a>].</li><li>In uncomplicated ankle sprain injuries, walking is usually possible within 1–2 weeks, with function restored after 6–8 weeks, and a return to sporting activities after 8–12 weeks (depending on the severity of the injury) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sprains-strains/references/\">de Bie, 2006</a>].</li><li>Lateral ankle sprains have the highest recurrence rates of all lower limb musculoskeletal injuries, with a two-fold increased risk of re-injury in the year following initial injury, leading to a large proportion of people developing chronic ankle instability [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sprains-strains/references/\">Gribble, 2016</a>].</li><li>A systematic review found the long term prognosis of acute ankle sprain is poor, with up to 70% of people reporting persistent residual symptoms and injury recurrence [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sprains-strains/references/\">Doherty, 2017</a>].</li><li>A systematic review of 31 studies of adults with acute lateral ankle sprains found [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sprains-strains/references/\">van Rijn, 2008</a>]:<ul><li>There was a rapid decrease in pain reporting within the first 2 weeks in the majority of people, after which pain continued to improve more slowly.</li><li>5–33% of people still experienced pain after 1 year.</li><li>36–85% of people reported full recovery within a period of 3 years.</li><li>The risk of re-injury affected 3–34% of people, and these occurred 2 weeks to 8 years post-injury.</li><li>Overall, a wide variation in reported subjective instability, re-injury, and recovery rates was noted among the different studies.</li></ul></li><li>A five-year observational follow-up study of acute lateral ankle sprain in primary care (n = 206) found [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sprains-strains/references/\">Mailuhu, 2018</a>]:<ul><li>18.2% of people had persistent symptoms.</li><li>30.3% of people experienced a re-injury during follow up.</li><li>Persistent symptoms 6–12 months after acute injury, dominant leg injury, and a recurrent injury were significant predictors for persistent symptoms at 5 years follow up.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field c837111b-2766-4420-9fb5-ab8500da67af --><!-- end
