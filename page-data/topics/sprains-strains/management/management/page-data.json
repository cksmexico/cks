It noted, however, that NSAIDs may suppress or delay the natural healing process.</li><li>It found that opioid analgesics (such as codeine) are equally effective for pain relief, but lead to significantly more adverse effects (based on two RCTs, n = 869).</li><li>The approach of favouring paracetamol first-line is supported by expert opinion in review articles that note that paracetamol is probably the most cost-effective and potentially least harmful choice of analgesia for soft tissue knee injuries [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sprains-strains/references/\">Robb, 2007</a>], and paracetamol is an equally effective alternative to NSAIDs for the pain management of ankle injuries [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sprains-strains/references/\">Chen, 2019</a>]. </li></ul></li><li>A Cochrane systematic review of 16 low- or very-low quality RCTs (n = 2144) of oral NSAIDs compared with other oral analgesia found [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sprains-strains/references/\">Jones, 2015</a>]:<ul><li>Nine studies (n = 991) compared NSAIDs with paracetamol. While tending to favour paracetamol, there was a lack of clinically important differences between the two groups in outcomes of pain, swelling, and return to function, at less than 24 hours up to 7 days and over.</li><li>Four studies (n = 958) compared NSAIDs with opioids. There was low-quality evidence for a lack of clinically important differences between the two groups regarding pain at less than 24 hours, at days 4–6, and at day 7. Evidence from single studies showed a similar lack of difference between the two groups for swelling at days 3 and 10. There was low-quality evidence supporting the use of NSAIDs for return to function at day 7 or over. Overall, it found low- or very low-quality evidence of improved function and fewer adverse events with NSAIDs compared with opioid-containing analgesics.</li><li>It concluded there is generally low- or very low-quality but consistent evidence of no clinically important difference in efficacy between NSAIDs and other oral analgesics for pain relief.</li><li>The included studies were of variable methodological quality and were at variable risk of bias.</li></ul></li><li>A Cochrane systematic review of 61 studies of the efficacy and safety of topical NSAIDs found [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sprains-strains/references/\">Derry, 2015</a>]:<ul><li>Moderate- or high-quality evidence that formulations of topical diclofenac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, piroxicam, and indomethacin provided significantly more study participants with at least 50% pain intensity reduction than topical placebo preparations.</li><li>Topical NSAIDs provided good levels of pain relief in acute conditions such as sprains, strains and overuse injuries, probably similar to that provided by oral NSAIDs. Gel formulations of diclofenac, ibuprofen, and ketoprofen provided the best results.</li><li>There were insufficient data to compare reliably individual topical NSAIDs with each other or the same oral NSAID.</li><li>There was high-quality evidence of very few systemic adverse events, and low-quality data of very few withdrawals due to adverse events.</li></ul></li><li>A meta-analysis of 28 RCTs of the effectiveness and safety of topical and oral NSAIDs for acute ankle sprain found limited evidence for the short-term use of NSAIDs [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sprains-strains/references/\">van den Bekeron, 2015</a>]:<ul><li>It reported favourable results for oral NSAIDs when compared with placebo regarding pain on weight-bearing in the short-term, pain at rest in the short-term, and swelling in the short- and medium-term.</li><li>Similarly, it reported favourable results for topical NSAIDs when compared with placebo for pain at rest in the short-term, persistent pain in the medium-term, pain on weight-bearing in the short- and medium-term, and for swelling in the short- and medium-term.</li><li>No trials were included comparing oral with topical NSAIDs.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h5>Advising on initial 'PRICE' (protection, rest, ice, compression, and elevation) self-management strategies</h5><ul><li>CKS found insufficient evidence to determine the relative effectiveness of PRICE measures for acute sprains and strains.<ul><li>The recommendation on protection of the joint or muscle is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good medical practice.

It is unknown if a RICE protocol improves the effect of exercise, but it noted the strong empirical evidence base for ice treatment, particularly for the outcome of pain.</li></ul></li><li>A Dutch consensus statement notes that 'RICE' is a conservative treatment method that has not been rigorously investigated, with limited evidence of efficacy for reducing injury-associated symptoms following acute lateral ankle sprain. It highlights [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sprains-strains/references/\">Vuurberg, 2018</a>]:<ul><li>Limited evidence from 33 RCTs (n = 2337) that showed the efficacy of ice therapy for reducing ankle sprain symptoms is unclear.</li><li>Limited evidence from one small RCT (n = 30) that in combination with exercise therapy, ice therapy has a greater effect on reducing swelling compared with heat application.</li><li>The combination of ice with exercise therapy results in significant improvements in ankle function in the short-term, allowing people to weight-bear more comfortably compared with 'standard functional treatment' (based on one RCT, n = 101), however, it states the individual aspects of RICE are not effective (and found no evidence for the individual effects of rest and elevation after lateral ankle sprain injury).</li><li>The use of RICE plus 'multimodal' physiotherapy compared with RICE alone provides no additional benefits. Both treatments provided pain reduction, increased function, and reduced ankle swelling (based on one small RCT, n = 28).</li><li>Overall, it found no evidence that RICE alone, or ice therapy, or compression therapy alone has any positive influence on pain, swelling, or ankle function. It noted a short time of immobilization may help to reduce pain and swelling in cases of lateral ligament injury.</li></ul></li><li>A systematic review of the management of ankle sprains found that [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sprains-strains/references/\">Seah, 2011</a>]:<ul><li>For mild-to-moderate injuries, functional treatment options (such as elastic bandaging, soft casting, taping, or orthoses with associated coordination training) were statistically better than immobilization, for multiple outcome measures.</li><li>For severe ankle sprains, a short period of immobilization (in a below-knee cast or pneumatic brace) resulted in a quicker recovery than tubular compression bandage alone.</li></ul></li><li>Expert opinion in various review articles has noted the poor evidence base for the use of standard practice 'RICE' protocols.<ul><li>An article on acute knee injuries notes there is no evidence that RICE is effective for acute musculoskeletal injuries, however, it is widely accepted as standard management [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sprains-strains/references/\">Robb, 2007</a>].</li><li>An article on acute ankle sprains notes the evidence supporting the RICE approach is limited, however, it states it is a reasonable intervention in the acute phase of ankle sprain for short-term symptomatic pain control to facilitate early mobilization [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sprains-strains/references/\">Chen, 2019</a>].</li><li>An additional article on ankle and foot injuries in emergency departments states all levels of severity of ankle sprain can be effectively treated with RICE and a short period of non-weight bearing, with a view to increase weight-bearing depending on severity and stability.
