It is the result of an acute inflammatory lesion in the optic nerve and typically presents with visual impairment and pain on eye movements.</li><li><strong>Oscillopsia</strong> is the subjective sensation of horizontal and/or vertical movement of the visual field that is unexplained by movement of the observer or environment. In people with MS, oscillopsia is usually due to nystagmus.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Reduced mobility</strong> — 85% of people with MS report a gait disturbance as their main complaint.<ul><li>Causes of reduced mobility include muscle weakness, spasticity, disordered balance, poor coordination, and visual problems.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Pain</strong> — estimates of the prevalence of MS-related pain vary widely from 29–86%. Pain can be neuropathic or musculoskeletal in origin.<ul><li>Neuropathic pain is likely due to nervous system damage caused by MS lesions and may present as dysesthetic extremity pain (abnormal sensations such as burning or prickling), painful tonic spasms, Lhermitte's sign (a shock-like sensation radiating down the spine induced by neck flexion), trigeminal neuralgia, headaches, or low back pain.</li><li>Musculoskeletal pain is usually secondary to problems with mobility and posture.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Bladder problems</strong> — present in over 90% of patients with progressive MS and includes difficulty with storage control (urinary frequency, urgency, and incontinence) as a result of neurogenic detrusor overactivity.<ul><li>One survey of people with MS (n = 309) reported that urinary urgency was the most common urinary symptom (62%), followed by frequency (50.4%), urge incontinence (44.7%), and nocturia (33%) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/multiple-sclerosis/references/\">Akkoc, 2015</a>].</li></ul></li><li><strong>Sexual dysfunction</strong> — a significant, but often underestimated or overlooked, complication of MS, affecting 50–90% of men and 40–80% of women with MS at some stage in their disease process.</li><li><strong>Mental health problems:</strong><ul><li><strong>Depression and anxiety</strong> — common in MS with reported lifetime prevalence rates up to 50%.</li><li><strong>Emotional lability </strong>(pseudobulbar affect) — people with emotional lability may laugh or cry without any apparent trigger. Once this starts it cannot easily be controlled, may occur at inappropriate times, and can be very distressing.</li><li><strong>Cognitive impairment</strong> — affects 43–70% of people with MS during the course of their illness and can lead to reduced engagement in social activities, employment difficulties, problems carrying out routine household tasks, and reduced quality of life for the person and their family/carer(s).</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/multiple-sclerosis/references/\">Kessler, 2009</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/multiple-sclerosis/references/\">Brola, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/multiple-sclerosis/references/\">Seixas, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/multiple-sclerosis/references/\">Drulovic, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/multiple-sclerosis/references/\">Alberta Health and the Alberta Medical Association, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/multiple-sclerosis/references/\">Veauthier, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/multiple-sclerosis/references/\">Aharony, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/multiple-sclerosis/references/\">Kalb, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/multiple-sclerosis/references/\">Thompson, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/multiple-sclerosis/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/multiple-sclerosis/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2020</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/multiple-sclerosis/references/\">Solari, 2020</a>]</p><!-- end field 38ba2e84-ed91-475a-bc1e-a78a009c94b1 --><!-- end item fdd71941-3ae9-4cc9-9e45-a78a009c932d -->","topic":{"id":"d4f5f727-ed37-55a1-abb1-280e5fc9851e","topicId":"5d674db8-174e-4008-be2b-97980377bc61","topicName":"Multiple sclerosis","slug":"multiple-sclerosis","lastRevised":"Last revised in August 2020","chapters":[{"id":"5bcd2220-ea7d-5aa0-b179-870dd52d1a9d","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"0b281488-c1a9-571c-9f76-76a0ca4f3f61","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"0268dff6-e6a3-5331-9e13-7258fdfe9bdb","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"ac99d001-df07-5809-9d43-3d52702e71a7","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"0c03fe4d-4002-5f0b-a40a-ea4925270b27","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"6ed54162-5487-59f3-b908-b856fb8f2150","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"952c02eb-45ac-5b32-afcc-183466bb602e","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"4b841ec7-26b6-5463-a184-0cdf46d3b8a5","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"6282c221-3df8-5a37-a525-cfaf733f007d","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"9c0d0509-a813-56b1-b980-801b252d4045","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"bba30032-e86d-577c-a3ca-fa9aed61784a","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
