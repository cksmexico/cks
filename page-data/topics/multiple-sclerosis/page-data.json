Episodes of symptoms (relapses) are followed by recovery (remissions) and periods of stability. Typically, after several relapses residual damage to parts of the CNS remains resulting in only partial recovery during remissions.</li><li>Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) — occurs when there is a gradual accumulation of disability unrelated to relapses, which become less frequent or stop completely. About two thirds of people with RRMS progress to SPMS.</li><li>Primary progressive MS (PPMS) — in PPMS there is a steady gradual worsening of the disease from the onset, without remissions. This occurs in about 10–15% of people with MS.</li></ul></li><li>The cause of MS is unknown.<ul><li>It is thought that acute then chronic immune-mediated inflammation is precipitated by an abnormal response to environmental triggers in people who are genetically predisposed.</li><li>A combination of risk factors may contribute including genetic factors, vitamin D deficiency, infection, geographical location (extremes of latitude), smoking, obesity during adolescence, and female gender.</li></ul></li><li>Presenting symptoms and signs vary greatly, but the four most common presentations are optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, cerebellar-related symptoms, and brainstem syndromes.</li><li>The natural history of RRMS is unpredictable — severity and frequency of relapses vary greatly, as can the time it takes to progress to SPMS and to significant permanent disability.<ul><li>Treatment with disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) may reduce the number and severity of relapses and delay disability progression.</li></ul></li><li>If MS is suspected, the person should be referred promptly to a consultant neurologist — only a consultant neurologist should make the diagnosis of MS.<ul><li>Blood tests should be arranged to exclude some alternative diagnoses — urgent referral should not be delayed while waiting for results. An MRI scan should not be requested by the referring doctor in advance of specialist assessment.</li></ul></li><li>If a person with MS is suspected of having a relapse:<ul><li>Infections should be ruled out, particularly urinary tract and respiratory infections.</li><li>Fluctuations in disease, disease progression, and other conditions unrelated to MS that may present with similar clinical features should be considered.</li><li>The person's MS team should be contacted promptly to discuss appropriate management. This often includes oral methylprednisolone 0.5 g daily for 5 days which may shorten the length and severity of the relapse.</li></ul></li><li>All people with MS should have a comprehensive review at least once a year. This is normally done in secondary care.</li><li>As MS lesions can develop almost anywhere in the CNS, various complications may develop including fatigue, spasticity, ataxia, tremor, mobility problems, visual problems, pain, bladder problems, sexual problems, and mental health problems. Various drug and non-drug therapies are used to help manage these complications.</li></ul><!-- end field 92dfbd07-0e27-4f43-ab43-dee5ca806483 --><!-- end item 3486e2db-8f7d-4ffb-90ff-d74ffc6b8477
