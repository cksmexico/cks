<em>Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and infectious mononucleosis</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">CDC,

href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">Johannsen, 2009</a>].</p><h4>Full blood count (FBC) with differential white cell count</h4><ul><li>Expert opinion in review articles is that greater than 20% atypical lymphocytes, or greater than 10% atypical lymphocytes with lymphocyte count greater than 50% of differential are considered strong evidence of glandular fever [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">Smellie, 2007</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">BMJ, 2018</a>].</li><li>FBC will also identify haematological complications, if present, such as neutropenia, and haemolytic anaemia [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">BMJ, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">Smellie, 2007</a>].</li><li>Haematological abnormalities can be absent in young children [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">BMJ, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h4>Monospot test (heterophile antibodies)</h4><ul><li>Heterophile antibodies are present in about 90% of people older than 12 years of age who have glandular fever [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">Johannsen, 2009</a>]. </li><li>Blood should be taken in the second or third week of the illness because false‐negative rates are high in the first week of infection (about 25%) but peak during the second or third week of the illness (about 5% in week three). Repeat testing is recommended in suspected cases if an initial test is negative [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">Pagana, 2002</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">Smellie, 2007</a>].</li><li>False‐negative rates are also reported to be higher in children (in whom specific antibody testing is recommended) and in immunocompromized people (in whom immunological testing is considered potentially unreliable) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">Smellie, 2007</a>].</li><li>The monospot test is not recommended for general use by the CDC because [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">CDC, 2018</a>]:<ul><li>The antibodies detected by monospot can be caused by conditions other than glandular fever.</li><li>The monospot produces both false-positive and false-negative results. For example, the heterophile antibodies detected by monospot are often not present in children with glandular fever.</li><li>At best, the monospot test may indicate that a person has a typical case of glandular fever, but does not confirm the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>EBV serology tests</h4><ul><li>EBV serology tests provide a stage-specific diagnosis. The tests measure the activity of three types of antibodies: viral capsid antigen (VCA), early antigen (EA), and EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA).<ul><li>The VCA antibodies are either IgM or IgG, and the specific antigens are important for distinguishing between acute and past infection, respectively [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">BMJ, 2018</a>]. VCA-IgM appears early in EBV infection and usually disappears within 4–6 weeks, whereas VCA-IgG appears in the acute phase of EBV infection, peaks at 2–4 weeks after onset, declines slightly, then persists for the rest of a person’s life [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">CDC, 2018</a>].</li><li>Anti-EA IgG appears in the acute phase of illness and generally falls to undetectable levels after 3–6 months. In many people, detection of antibody to EA is a sign of active infection. However, 20% of healthy people may have antibodies against EA for years [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">CDC, 2018</a>].</li><li>Antibody to EBNA, determined by the standard immunofluorescent test, is not seen in the acute phase of EBV infection but slowly appears 2–4 months after onset of symptoms and persists for the rest of a person’s life. Other EBNA enzyme immunoassays may report false-positive results [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">CDC, 2018</a>].</li></ul></li><li>EBV antibody tests are not usually needed to diagnose glandular fever. However, specific antibody tests may be needed to identify the cause of illness in people who do not have typical features of glandular fever or have other illnesses that can be caused by EBV [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">CDC, 2018</a>]. They are also useful in children younger than 12 years of age and in immunocompromized people [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">Smellie, 2007</a>].</li><li>Symptoms of glandular fever generally resolve within 4 weeks. If a person is ill for more than 6 months and does not have a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of EBV infection, other causes of chronic illness or chronic fatigue syndrome should be considered [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">CDC, 2018</a>].</li><li>EBV serology has a high sensitivity and specificity and is more sensitive than the monospot test [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">BMJ, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h4>Testing for cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, and HIV</h4><ul><li>Expert opinion in a review article is that [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">Smellie, 2007</a>]:<ul><li>Only people who are immunocompromized or pregnant should be tested after two negative monospot tests because cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis are usually self-limiting infections.</li><li>HIV testing may be appropriate in at-risk people, as primary HIV infection may present as a glandular fever-like illness.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Liver function tests (LFTs)</h4><ul><li>Expert opinion in review articles is that LFTs may provide additional support to the diagnosis of glandular fever by showing a hepatitic picture. If liver dysfunction is present it usually develops early in the illness, and normalizes after 20 days [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">Johannsen, 2009</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/references/\">Lennon, 2015</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field a047680b-d964-436a-aab6-055683720c2b --><!-- end item 81f69e1f-68a4-4339-b8b5-523d1a45764c -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
