It can also spread during sexual contact (through blood and semen), blood transfusions, organ transplantations, and by intrauterine transmission.</li><li>The incubation period is about 4–7 weeks. The disease is contagious during the incubation period and while symptoms are present; some people may be contagious for as long as 18 months after having the infection.</li><li>EBV infection leads to a lifelong latent carrier state. The virus may reactivate but does not always cause symptoms. People who are immunocompromized are more likely to develop symptoms if EBV reactivates.</li></ul></li><li>Glandular fever is most common in people aged 15–24 years, although cases have been reported in people of all ages.</li><li>In most people, it is self-limiting and lasts 2–4 weeks. Occasionally the disease course can be prolonged (lasting for weeks or months). <ul><li>Serious complications are rare and include upper airways obstruction, splenic rupture, and neutropenia. In immunocompromized people, EBV infection may result in malignant disease, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.</li><li>Fatigue is common and usually lasts for a few weeks (or for several months in a minority of people).</li></ul></li><li>Glandular fever should be suspected if there is fever, lymphadenopathy, and a sore throat.<ul><li>In people older than 40 years of age, glandular fever is rare and may present atypically — without sore throat and lymphadenopathy, with unexplained fever of more than 2 weeks' duration, and/or with jaundice.</li><li>In children, the infection is usually asymptomatic.</li></ul></li><li>Tests which help to confirm the diagnosis of glandular fever include:<ul><li>A full blood count and differential count for lymphocytosis and atypical lymphocytes.</li><li>Monospot test (heterophile antibodies) in immunocompetent adults.</li><li>EBV serology test in children younger than 12 years of age and in people who are immunocompromized.</li></ul></li><li>The differential diagnosis of glandular fever includes:<ul><li>Other causes of sore throat, especially streptococcal sore throat.</li><li>Other causes of lymphadenopathy, such as leukaemia and lymphoma.</li><li>Other viral infections that may present with a glandular fever-like illness with an atypical lymphocytosis, such as rubella, acute toxoplasmosis, mumps, and HIV.</li></ul></li><li>Management of glandular fever includes:<ul><li>Symptomatic relief with paracetamol or ibuprofen.</li><li>Reassurance that the condition is usually self limiting and that fatigue is common. </li><li>Encouraging the person to return to normal activities as soon as possible. Exclusion from work or school is not necessary.</li><li>Advising the person to avoid heavy lifting and contact or collision sports for the first month of the illness (to reduce the risk of splenic rupture).</li><li>Advising on ways to limit the spread of the disease (for example by avoiding kissing and by not sharing eating utensils).</li><li>Arranging hospital admission if serious complications are suspected.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field e0cb1aa5-33cc-4048-8288-eac3bfdeb10d --><!-- end item c66d524d-04ac-4788-aaf1-f1f8814f5fc3 -->","topic":{"id":"79787412-82dc-54ee-8f4d-82bb69926abd","topicId":"c9504b30-5339-4b0e-ae98-8637960b13dd","topicName":"Glandular fever (infectious mononucleosis)","slug":"glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis","aliases":["Infectious mononucleosis -
