It is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, the virus which causes chicken pox.</li><li>The incidence (and severity) of shingles increase with age. Other risk factors include immunocompromise (for example due to long-term corticosteroid use; HIV infection; lymphoproliferative malignancies; or chemotherapy treatment), certain comorbidities (such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma), psychological factors, and female sex. </li><li>Post-herpetic neuralgia (defined as pain persisting for, or appearing more than, 90 days after rash onset) is the most common complication of shingles and is more common in older people. Other complications include secondary infection, scarring, ocular complications, and disseminated disease.</li><li>Assessment of a person with suspected shingles should include:<ul><li>Asking about the symptoms experienced (location, duration, and severity).</li><li>Identifying risk factors for shingles, such as immunocompromise due to long-term corticosteroid use.</li><li>Examining the person to assess for clinical features of shingles and to exclude differential diagnoses (such as herpes simplex virus infection and contact dermatitis). </li></ul></li><li>Diagnosis is usually made on clinical grounds.<ul><li>Shingles is characterized by a prodromal period with abnormal skin sensations and pain, followed by a unilateral vesicular rash in the affected dermatome. </li><li>The location of symptoms depends on the affected nerve: in immunocompetent people, the infection usually occurs on the thorax, with dermatomes T1 to L2 most commonly affected. In immunocompromised people, symptoms can be more widespread and affect multiple dermatomes (disseminated disease).</li><li>The rash may be atypical in certain groups of people, for example, older people (in whom the rash may not be vesicular) and immunocompromised people (in whom the rash may be severe or long-lasting). </li></ul></li><li>Management of shingles involves:<ul><li>Assessing the person to help guide management decisions. </li><li>Arranging hospital admission or seeking immediate specialist advice, where appropriate, for example, if the person is severely immunocompromised, has ophthalmic involvement, is systemically unwell, has a severe or widespread rash or multiple dermatomal involvement, or is an immunocompromised child.</li><li>Prescribing oral antiviral treatment, if appropriate.</li><li>Managing pain. </li><li>Offering self-care advice, including advice to avoid contact with people who have not had chickenpox, particularly pregnant women, immunocompromised people, and babies younger than 1 month of age; keep the rash clean and dry; cover lesions while the rash is still weeping; and avoid work, school, or day care if the rash is weeping and cannot be covered. </li><li>Considering the need for referral or specialist advice, for example, if antiviral treatment is being considered in a pregnant or breastfeeding woman, new vesicles are forming after 7 days of antiviral treatment, healing is delayed, shingles is recurrent, or pain is inadequately controlled.</li></ul></li><li>In the UK, there is a shingles vaccination programme for people aged 70 years and older, in whom the incidence and severity of shingles and of subsequent post-herpetic neuralgia is higher. People remain eligible for the shingles vaccine until their 80th birthday.</li></ul><!-- end field 9523e593-596b-46a8-9b64-7696d1a46bd9 --><!-- end item c1756e6a-e16f-4d7b-9d20-c990a2e17da4 -->","topic":{"id":"012e484d-8c14-5168-bb5d-e5acb7d4571a","topicId":"2969a8ac-cb7f-4569-be79-822e6009081a","topicName":"Shingles","slug":"shingles","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"eeb1b918-6c05-5340-b348-ce2809516623","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"8ad8b1b2-36bb-5262-ab5a-05763d6e4c7d","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"b1aed669-8481-5315-ab58-4bb18606e360","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"8fef2c66-91dc-57c6-8cd3-4e4eff8d7727","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"ea603e45-ec07-5201-a182-ebef4c48ef6b","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"81feec28-1a5d-5a24-9c52-bee13821b03b","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"bb672f83-c2bd-5dd7-9934-78f09729db48","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"2036bd3f-37bc-5cea-887d-55c3fc68c7cf","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"cc04b460-a0d8-5e8d-b8d0-c044947b4bd6","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"ee3573cb-38d5-5d4c-9c9d-cd274242d964","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"52999d3b-9cce-59c5-b588-1f7ad7de33e2","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
