The evidence showed that vaccine efficacy was similar across the age groups targeted for vaccination in the UK, and on duration of protection of the vaccine in public health use. The authors concluded that the UK shingles vaccination programme demonstrates good effectiveness of zoster vaccine, and very good protection against post-herpetic neuralgia [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shingles/references/\">Walker, 2018</a>].</li><li>A retrospective cohort study that assessed the incidence rate of herpes zoster in people with a wide set of immunocompromised conditions and in immunocompromise-free people concluded that vaccination might be the most preferable herpes zoster preventive measure for the immunocompromised population, who contributes to the public health burden of herpes zoster in England [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shingles/references/\">Yanni, 2018</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 4204297f-b9a4-4cc2-8431-985cb3358118 --><!-- end item f3139241-2a71-4329-b4f4-d29026747df0 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
