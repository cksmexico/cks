A literature search was conducted in September 2019 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published since the last revision of this topic. The section on antiviral treatment has been amended to state that antiviral treatment should be <em>considered</em> for all people aged over 50 years. This is based on a Cochrane systematic review which concluded, on the basis of high-quality evidence, that oral aciclovir does not significantly reduce the incidence of post-herpetic neuralgia [Chen, 2014]. The review found insufficient evidence from RCTs to ascertain whether this is also the case for other antiviral drugs.</p><!-- end field 8f0b3b0d-e099-47c7-8389-1734afbb5a53 --><!-- end item 34d1855c-a7e3-4705-a673-1d5ebf095dc4 -->","topic":{"id":"012e484d-8c14-5168-bb5d-e5acb7d4571a","topicId":"2969a8ac-cb7f-4569-be79-822e6009081a","topicName":"Shingles","slug":"shingles","lastRevised":"Last revised in October 2020","chapters":[{"id":"eeb1b918-6c05-5340-b348-ce2809516623","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"8ad8b1b2-36bb-5262-ab5a-05763d6e4c7d","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"b1aed669-8481-5315-ab58-4bb18606e360","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"8fef2c66-91dc-57c6-8cd3-4e4eff8d7727","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"ea603e45-ec07-5201-a182-ebef4c48ef6b","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"81feec28-1a5d-5a24-9c52-bee13821b03b","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"bb672f83-c2bd-5dd7-9934-78f09729db48","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"2036bd3f-37bc-5cea-887d-55c3fc68c7cf","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"cc04b460-a0d8-5e8d-b8d0-c044947b4bd6","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"ee3573cb-38d5-5d4c-9c9d-cd274242d964","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"52999d3b-9cce-59c5-b588-1f7ad7de33e2","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
