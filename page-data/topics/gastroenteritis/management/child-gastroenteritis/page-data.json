It did not find any studies that provided direct evidence on the effectiveness of different oral fluid regimens in terms of route of administration, frequency of administration, or volume of fluid to be used.

Low-osmolarity ORS solution has reduced concentrations of sodium and glucose, and is associated with less vomiting, stool output, hypernatraemia, and reduced need for intravenous fluids compared with standard ORS. Similarly, the IDSA publication found moderate-quality evidence supporting the use of low-osmolarity ORS as first-line therapy of mild-to-moderate dehydration due to acute diarrhoea and vomiting.</li><li>The joint ESPGHAN/ESPID publication recommends initial rehydration over 4–6 hours, and an age-appropriate diet should be started during or after initial rehydration. It notes that dilution of milk formula or use of a modified milk formula is not normally necessary. This approach is supported by the IDSA publication, which found low-quality evidence that usual diet should be resumed during or immediately after rehydration, and the WGO guidelines, which state that withholding food for more than 4 hours is inappropriate.</li><li>Furthermore, a systematic review of 31 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for gastroenteritis in children (n = 4444) found [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gastroenteritis/references/\">Freedman, 2015</a>]:<ul><li>Low-quality evidence that, compared with intravenous rehydration, the rates of hospitalization and return visits to emergency departments were similar when ORT was given.

Although there was good evidence that loperamide is effective at reducing the frequency and duration of diarrhoea in children, the guideline development group did not recommend its use as serious adverse effects (such as necrotizing enterocolitis, neurological symptoms, delirium, respiratory depression, coma, and death) have been reported following its use in children. In addition, the British National Formulary (BNF) states loperamide use is not recommended for children under 12 years of age [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gastroenteritis/references/\">Joint Formulary Committee, 2019</a>].</li><li>The joint ESPGHAN/ESPID publication similarly does not recommend loperamide in the management of acute gastroenteritis in children.</li><li>The WGO expert consensus guidelines concluded that antidiarrheal drugs have no practical benefits for children with acute or persistent diarrhoea, and there is evidence that loperamide increases disease severity and complications, particularly in children with invasive diarrhoea.</li><li>The IDSA publication found moderate-quality evidence that antimotility drugs such as loperamide should not be given to children less than 18 years of age with acute diarrhoea.</li><li>NICE found no evidence to support the use of the absorbent drug kaolin in children with diarrhoea, although there was some evidence from one small study to suggest a beneficial effect of charcoal, the guideline development group considered that young children would find this unpalatable.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendations on antiemetics are largely based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gastroenteritis/references/\">NICE, 2009</a>], a NICE surveillance review [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gastroenteritis/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>], the joint ESPGHAN/ESPID publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gastroenteritis/references/\">Guarino, 2014</a>], a Cochrane systematic review [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gastroenteritis/references/\">Fedorowicz, 2011</a>], and an additional systematic review [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gastroenteritis/references/\">Freedman, 2015</a>].<ul><li>NICE analyzed evidence from five RCTs comparing antiemetic treatment with placebo or another antiemetic drug for children with gastroenteritis. It found that oral ondansetron increases the success rate of ORT, but the guideline development group expressed concern that ondansetron might worsen diarrhoea. Weak evidence identified by NICE did not support the use of other antiemetic drugs, and the guideline development group concluded that the use of antiemetics in children with gastroenteritis was not currently recommended.</li><li>A subsequent NICE surveillance review also found evidence that antiemetic drug treatment may cause an increase in diarrhoea, and notes that it is not currently licensed for use in children with gastroenteritis.</li><li>The joint ESPGHAN/ESPID publication states that ondansetron is effective against vomiting, but its routine use requires 'safety clearance' due to the possibility of severe cardiac adverse effects.</li><li>A Cochrane systematic review of seven RCTs (n = 1020) of the safety and effectiveness of antiemetics for vomiting from gastroenteritis in children and adolescents found:<ul><li>Pooled data from three studies comparing oral ondansetron with placebo showed a reduction in the immediate hospital admission rate (risk ratio [RR] 0.40, NNT 17, 95% CI 10 to 100) but no difference in the hospital revisit rate; a reduced need for intravenous fluids in the emergency department (RR 0.41, NNT 5, 95% CI 4 to 8) and in follow up after discharge (worst‐best scenario for ondansetron RR 0.57, NNT 6, 95% CI 4 to 13), and an increase in the proportion of children who stopped vomiting (RR 1.34, NNT 5, 95% CI 3 to 7).

It concluded that additional evidence was needed on the use of oral zinc.</li><li>The joint ESPGHAN/ESPID publication states that zinc supplementation may be helpful for children with acute gastroenteritis in developing countries, but in regions where zinc deficiency is rare, no benefit is expected.</li><li>Similarly, the IDSA publication found moderate-quality evidence that oral zinc supplementation reduces the duration of diarrhoea in children aged 6 months to 5 years living in countries with a high prevalence of zinc deficiency or who have signs of malnutrition.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendations on probiotics are based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gastroenteritis/references/\">NICE, 2009</a>], a Cochrane systematic review [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gastroenteritis/references/\">Allen, 2010</a>], an additional systematic review [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gastroenteritis/references/\">Freedman, 2015</a>], and an expert consensus publication on travellers' diarrhoea [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gastroenteritis/references/\">Riddle, 2017</a>].<ul><li>The NICE guideline found evidence that treatment with probiotics may have a beneficial effect on symptoms, however, there were wide variations in the included studies, and the guideline development group did not recommend their use in children.</li><li>A Cochrane systematic review of 63 variable-quality RCTs (n = 8014) of the effects of probiotics for treating proven or presumed acute infectious diarrhoea found:<ul><li>Probiotics reduced the duration of diarrhoea with a mean difference in duration of diarrhoea of 24.76 hours (95% CI 15.9 to 33.6 hours); a reduced likelihood of diarrhoea duration for more than 4 days (RR 0.41; CI 0.32 to 0.53); and reduced stool frequency on day 2 (mean difference 0.80; CI 0.45 to 1.14). There were considerable differences in effect size between the studies, and significant heterogeneity in the study populations and settings, definitions of diarrhoea illness, pathogens, and probiotic strains and doses used.</li><li>The authors concluded that probiotics appear to be safe and beneficial, but more research is needed to guide the use of particular probiotic regimens in specific patient groups.</li></ul></li><li>A subsequent systematic review of 31 RCTs of interventions for gastroenteritis in children in outpatient and emergency department settings (n = 4444) found [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gastroenteritis/references/\">Freedman, 2015</a>]:<ul><li>Pooled results from three studies showed low or very low-quality evidence of no difference between probiotic and placebo groups for hospitalization rates within 7 days, and one study showed no difference between the groups in the need for intravenous fluids within 7 days.

This approach is supported by the WGO guidelines that highlight the importance of carers being able to recognize features of dehydration and when to seek medical help.</li><li>The information on the expected timeframes of symptoms is based on the NICE clinical guideline, which advises the need to reconsider the diagnosis if symptoms follow an unexpected natural history.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Ensuring notification of relevant diseases and organisms</h5><ul><li>These recommendations are based on a PHE publication on notification, which states that depending on the specific microorganism identified, testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic household, co-traveller, and sexual contacts may be needed.
