In general:</p><p>In women with BRCA1 mutation, the estimated lifetime risk of breast cancer is 65–85% Gabai-Kapara, 2014 RCOG, 2015 Paluch-Shimon, 2016 National Collaborating Centre for Cancer, 2017. The estimated lifetime risk of ovarian cancer in these women is 40–63% RCOG, 2015 National Collaborating Centre for Cancer, 2017.</p><p>In women with BRCA2 mutation, the estimated lifetime risk of breast cancer is 40–85% Gabai-Kapara, 2014 RCOG, 2015 Paluch-Shimon, 2016 National Collaborating Centre for Cancer, 2017. The estimated lifetime risk of ovarian cancer in these women is 10–27% RCOG, 2015 National Collaborating Centre for Cancer, 2017.</p><p>In men with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, there is an estimated lifetime risk of breast cancer of 1.2% to less than 8%, respectively, and a doubling of prostate cancer risk Paluch-Shimon, 2016.</p><p>Over 2000 different BRCA1/2 gene mutations have been identified, and in some populations, founder mutations (that is, the initial mutation in a family or population) are the most prevalent ones Paluch-Shimon, 2016.</p><p>For example, the Ashkenazi Jewish community has three founder mutations, two in BRCA1 and one in BRCA2, which account for most of inherited cancer risk due to BRCA1 and BRCA2 Gabai-Kapara, 2014 Paluch-Shimon, 2016 National Collaborating Centre for Cancer, 2017. In this population, 2.5% of people carry one of these three mutations, which account for 11% of breast cancer and 40% of ovarian cancer cases Gabai-Kapara, 2014. </p><p>Founder mutations have also been described in Northern, Western, and Eastern Europe Paluch-Shimon, 2016.</p><p>Other gene mutations identified include:</p><p>TP53 mutation on chromosome 17 — most women with this mutation develop breast cancer by 50 years of age. TP53 is also associated with sarcomas of childhood, leukaemias, adrenocortical carcinomas, and brain tumours (Li–Fraumeni syndrome) Hill et al, 1997 Emery et al, 2001 National Collaborating Centre for Cancer, 2017.</p><p>PTEN gene (Cowden's syndrome) — this predisposes to breast, thyroid, and uterine cancers, and hamartomatous lesions of the skin Emery et al, 2001.</p><p>ATM, CHEK2, BRIP1, and PALB2 genes — these confer moderate risk of breast cancer Ahmed et al, 2009 National Collaborating Centre for Cancer, 2017.</p><p>It is important to emphasize that National Collaborating Centre for Cancer, 2017:</p><p>Some people may carry the abnormal gene without developing cancer themselves.</p><p>Most women who have a family history of breast cancer do not have a specific identifiable gene mutation. Some of these family histories will be due to lower-penetrance genes not yet discovered.</p><!-- end field edd0e857-0fa0-4b11-a64e-5fcd8df26fec --><!-- end item 97cdfa4b-bf82-4fe6-868b-94d721068fe7 -->","topic":{"id":"273ad47e-ae65-5768-be53-5ddd1a59479e","topicId":"bd5ef0a7-5bdf-453b-919f-23ebeade59e8","topicName":"Breast cancer - managing FH","slug":"breast-cancer-managing-fh","lastRevised":"Last revised in December 2018","chapters":[{"id":"f6ca27fc-9049-5932-b6b5-c6a1a14a77fd","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"2dd4a7a9-b879-5145-a15c-5922ac8e62ed","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"1eedf81f-6c36-5c24-816f-0c373b4fe0f4","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"f7449f3e-937f-584a-90af-48470e794a2c","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"28bea84b-3026-59d1-a564-3b8f8e660f19","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"d2268871-af9e-569e-ae6e-a786ab1bacec","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"c2ad0bbf-95fa-5512-a763-618d653b1f5e","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"b4ec1615-f118-573f-a98d-d4bbfdf7d53d","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"467c7316-a736-5600-b8e5-1c4ebf44b7ce","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"34c8a1ea-20f5-5197-86ff-6e75ed2a01c5","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"3361517e-9866-5a17-aabf-4d923a96c917","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP - Options for local implementation"},{"id":"fdcd7c54-3a68-5903-a4a1-241a63d19e62","slug":"nice-quality-standards","fullItemName":"NICE quality standards"}]},{"id":"d7bd1803-d45e-508d-8661-62ebaa4b3353","fullItemName":"Background information","slug":"background-information","subChapters":[{"id":"c6831679-919f-5e59-b6b9-d09ed6486aca","slug":"definition","fullItemName":"Definition"},{"id":"7d6fa54b-1dc8-5cbd-9bf4-6d9ac0dc26f0","slug":"prevalence","fullItemName":"Prevalence"},{"id":"c5d1b518-b87d-58d6-8554-f3960af8f976","slug":"genetic-risk-factors","fullItemName":"Genetic risk factors"}]},{"id":"61970169-7827-5d9e-acb0-e40e0888525d","fullItemName":"Management","slug":"management","subChapters":[{"id":"b118c829-c5a1-5ee5-a8da-71eb67facd8d","slug":"breast-cancer-managing-fh","fullItemName":"Scenario: Breast cancer - managing FH"}]},{"id":"eaf7a93e-8dae-5737-ba9c-13e8ad484b3c","fullItemName":"Supporting evidence","slug":"supporting-evidence","subChapters":[]},{"id":"a9d84940-3c17-5039-b3f8-73ef73f06d13","fullItemName":"How this topic was developed","slug":"how-this-topic-was-developed","subChapters":[{"id":"a8dea3b7-f328-50ea-985f-2d54f906032c","slug":"search-strategy","fullItemName":"Search strategy"},{"id":"067fe34b-66c2-52be-b2a6-f9366eaa8c2e","slug":"stakeholder-engagement","fullItemName":"Stakeholder engagement"},{"id":"1f91e5ff-a2aa-5aaf-ac5c-67750822d1e8","slug":"evidence-exclusion-criteria","fullItemName":"Evidence exclusion criteria"},{"id":"0bfaeb6f-e800-5a87-a861-0d00aeb7c136","slug":"organizational-behavioural-financial-barriers","fullItemName":"Organizational, behavioural and financial barriers"},{"id":"773a3929-781a-5faf-8d55-166112725d3a","slug":"declarations-of-interest","fullItemName":"Declarations of interest"}]},{"id":"89bfc412-56d8-52c5-95b1-6e923396679a","fullItemName":"References","slug":"references","subChapters":[]}]},"parentChapter":{"id":"d7bd1803-d45e-508d-8661-62ebaa4b3353","slug":"background-information","fullItemName":"Background information"},"subChapters":[]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
