A full time GP will usually diagnose one new person with prostate cancer each year.

It is seen in both sexes, though almost three-quarters of new cases are in males. The 5 year survival is approximately 55%.</li><li>Refer people using a suspected cancer pathway referral (for an appointment within 2 weeks) for bladder cancer if they are aged 45 years and over and have:<ul><li>Unexplained visible haematuria without urinary tract infection, or</li><li>Visible haematuria that persists or recurs after successful treatment of urinary tract infection.</li></ul></li><li>Refer people using a suspected cancer pathway referral (for an appointment within 2 weeks) for bladder cancer if they are aged 60 years and over and have unexplained non-visible haematuria and either dysuria or a raised white cell count on a blood test.</li><li>Consider non-urgent referral for bladder cancer in people aged 60 years and over with recurrent or persistent unexplained urinary tract infection.</li><li>Renal cancer — over 10,000 new renal cancers are diagnosed each year in the UK. A full time GP is likely to diagnose approximately one person with renal cancer every 3–5 years. It is seen in both sexes, though around 60% of new diagnoses are in males. The 5 year survival is over 55%.</li><li>Refer people using a suspected cancer pathway referral (for an appointment within 2 weeks) for renal cancer if they are aged 45 years and over and have:<ul><li>Unexplained visible haematuria without urinary tract infection, or</li><li>Visible haematuria that persists or recurs after successful treatment of urinary tract infection.</li></ul></li><li>Testicular cancer — over 2000 new testicular cancers are diagnosed each year in the UK. A full-time GP will usually diagnose one new person with testicular cancer during their career. It is atypical in terms of the age groups affected. The peak age of onset is 30–34 years, although it can occur in older males. It is the commonest cancer in males between 16 and 24 years. The 5 year survival is almost 100%.</li><li>Consider a suspected cancer pathway referral (for an appointment within 2 weeks) for testicular cancer in men if they have a non-painful enlargement or change in shape or texture of the testis.</li><li>Consider a direct access ultrasound scan for testicular cancer in men with unexplained or persistent testicular symptoms.</li><li>Penile cancer — penile cancer is rare, with around 500 cases diagnosed each year in the UK. A full time GP is likely to diagnose only one – if any – person with penile cancer during their career.</li><li>Consider a suspected cancer pathway referral (for an appointment within 2 weeks) for penile cancer in men if they have either:<ul><li>A penile mass or ulcerated lesion, where a sexually transmitted infection has been excluded as a cause, or</li><li>A persistent penile lesion after treatment for a sexually transmitted infection has been completed.</li></ul></li><li>Consider a suspected cancer pathway referral (for an appointment within 2 weeks) for penile cancer in men with unexplained or persistent symptoms affecting the foreskin or glans.</li></ul><!-- end field f9c43b26-8b33-4d13-87a0-d8a978d12813 --><!-- end item dbf9837b-f416-430d-a78d-02e74f86824c -->","topic":{"id":"c64ec72d-4714-555b-b12a-fd441ca67b32","topicId":"4ccc54cd-a2c6-4fd3-9483-7b55de4e06fa","topicName":"Urological cancers -
