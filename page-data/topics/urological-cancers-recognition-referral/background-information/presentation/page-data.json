Haematuria can occur, as can erectile dysfunction. Some prostate cancers present with disseminated disease, typically metastases to bone.</li><li>The lower urinary symptoms overlap with those of benign prostatic hyperplasia – and the two conditions can co-exist. Digital rectal examination can help to differentiate the two, with hardness of the prostate or individual nodules being features suggestive of cancer.</li><li>Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing is generally available in primary care, with age-specific raised values suggestive of cancer.</li><li>Definitive diagnosis requires biopsy, often guided by imaging. This is performed in secondary care.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Bladder cancer:</strong><ul><li>Several symptoms have been reported, with haematuria being the most common. Dysuria and urinary frequency are also features, especially when persistent.</li><li>As haematuria is a symptom of several cancers, investigation strategies may need to consider more than one possible cancer site, such as kidney, prostate, or endometrium. Similarly, dysuria and urinary frequency may be misattributed to urinary tract infection, especially in the elderly.</li><li>A diagnosis of bladder cancer is generally made by cystoscopy with biopsy, performed in secondary care. As bladder cancer shares some symptoms with other urological cancers, most haematuria clinics investigate with ultrasound before proceeding to cystoscopy.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Renal cancer:</strong><ul><li>Renal cancer symptoms include haematuria, loin pain, urinary tract infections, or a mass in the flank.</li><li>The symptoms overlap with other urological cancers, particularly bladder cancer.</li><li>Most renal cancers are visible on ultrasound of the kidneys – a test that is available on referral to primary care.</li><li>Definitive diagnosis of renal cancer requires histology, performed in secondary care</li></ul></li><li><strong>Testicular cancer:</strong><ul><li>Testicular cancer usually presents as a change in the shape or texture of the testis. This may be painful.</li><li>It can present as disseminated disease, particularly with lymph node spread.</li><li>Testicular cancer can be seen on ultrasound of the testis, a test that is available in primary care.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Penile cancer:</strong><ul><li>Penile cancer is usually seen as a raised lesion.</li><li>It can be difficult to differentiate penile cancer from the commoner lesions seen with some sexually transmitted diseases.</li><li>It is often possible to diagnose a typical penile cancer visually, but confirmation of the diagnosis is generally made by excision biopsy in secondary care.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/urological-cancers-recognition-referral/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Cancer, 2015</a>]</p><!-- end field 8a916570-0c19-47bb-b0db-e10fe8377cf9 --><!-- end item a1b30859-adf6-412e-a195-ecb97ae12bd6 -->","topic":{"id":"c64ec72d-4714-555b-b12a-fd441ca67b32","topicId":"4ccc54cd-a2c6-4fd3-9483-7b55de4e06fa","topicName":"Urological cancers - recognition and referral","slug":"urological-cancers-recognition-referral","lastRevised":"Last revised in February 2021","chapters":[{"id":"a6bb987a-e632-5fc3-8d30-fb871a028ed1","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"748a62ad-5b04-5468-a5ce-97c6481c7566","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"18d46e59-36c7-5b55-aa65-3600c901940f","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"a4e597f1-cc63-5d3b-97b7-ed0c1cbb2b37","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"969bbc1b-89ab-597b-9c13-e58c73973c47","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"2b375e17-1588-5dbc-bd02-bb06db6b34ff","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"a969ea4e-5b1e-5ce3-bc10-facb662797f9","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"dd20c78a-fc7f-5f9c-a882-115907b19165","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"9561691a-2035-5b37-9e9e-4f2930856afa","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"39713e7a-6ade-5468-a916-ef42fb466e19","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"559f945f-9805-56d3-b5eb-907dd06c68ab","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP - Options for local implementation"},{"id":"f90e5ce7-fddd-5929-994b-81f3568808c0","slug":"nice-quality-standards","fullItemName":"NICE quality standards"}]},{"id":"d68f575b-7060-52ac-8397-7dadfd612178","fullItemName":"Background information","slug":"background-information","subChapters":[{"id":"09cdbe97-79a1-5fd5-b0ef-8ca162bc3cba","slug":"presentation","fullItemName":"Presentation"},{"id":"0aebe8af-5f71-5805-b567-6d95c95ee05b","slug":"prevalence","fullItemName":"Prevalence"},{"id":"6141fbed-d327-5e18-970c-951c38a9bfab","slug":"prognosis","fullItemName":"Prognosis"}]},{"id":"f05bba22-10c0-58ff-9c5e-eb8128e76aa3","fullItemName":"Diagnosis","slug":"diagnosis","subChapters":[{"id":"57be949e-d544-560a-b03e-2211a2434d97","slug":"symptoms-suggestive-of-urological-cancers","fullItemName":"Symptoms suggestive of urological cancers"}]},{"id":"3b871537-9b9d-5b6f-a750-e314b06f2660","fullItemName":"Management","slug":"management","subChapters":[{"id":"bcec9d33-8447-5aa1-8b94-9ed03208f8f7","slug":"referral-for-suspected-urological-cancer","fullItemName":"Scenario: Referral for suspected urological cancer"}]},{"id":"f07308a4-4a9f-55e5-8994-88375e0358ff","fullItemName":"Supporting evidence","slug":"supporting-evidence","subChapters":[]},{"id":"4ea550c2-d5c5-5e7c-86f1-51e4d7508e56","fullItemName":"How this topic was developed","slug":"how-this-topic-was-developed","subChapters":[{"id":"bf6e9a70-8a4c-5aa5-9951-1b82bb2b47f1","slug":"search-strategy","fullItemName":"Search strategy"},{"id":"0c4e1071-9827-57a2-bd0b-d69f2f249539","slug":"stakeholder-engagement","fullItemName":"Stakeholder engagement"},{"id":"1974a788-5c91-5701-ad92-0ccfd3d277ff","slug":"evidence-exclusion-criteria","fullItemName":"Evidence exclusion criteria"},{"id":"2fd10533-9dfe-597b-937c-9ab7aff2a1d8","slug":"organizational-behavioural-financial-barriers","fullItemName":"Organizational, behavioural and financial barriers"},{"id":"5d9c3f4e-c903-581a-b904-6ff63017d472","slug":"declarations-of-interest","fullItemName":"Declarations of interest"}]},{"id":"c6ee8bcb-de73-5436-b699-cc8bb3dbaee2","fullItemName":"References","slug":"references","subChapters":[]}]},"parentChapter":{"id":"d68f575b-7060-52ac-8397-7dadfd612178","slug":"background-information","fullItemName":"Background information"},"subChapters":[]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
