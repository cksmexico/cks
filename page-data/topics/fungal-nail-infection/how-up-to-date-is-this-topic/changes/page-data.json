Update to the prescribing information text on terbinafine, to make it consistent across CKS topics. Recommendations to monitor liver function tests before and during treatment with terbinafine, and to reduce the dose of terbinafine in people with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 50 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2 </sup>have been added.</p><p><strong>September 2013 </strong>— reviewed. A literature search was conducted in July 2013 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key randomized controlled trials published since the last revision of the topic. There are no changes to the recommendations.</p><p><strong>January 2012 </strong>— minor error corrected in prescribing information for itraconazole and terbinafine. Issued in February 2012.</p><p><strong>January to May 2009 </strong>— converted from CKS guidance to CKS topic structure. The evidence-base has been reviewed in detail, and recommendations are more clearly justified and transparently linked to the supporting evidence. There are only minor changes to the recommendations. Continuous itraconazole and topical tioconazole are no longer recommended because alternative treatments are more practical.</p><p><strong>April 2008 </strong>— minor update to the text for oral ketoconazole which now reflects the most recent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) guidance.</p><p><strong>March 2008 </strong>— minor update. New text inserted regarding rare cases of changes in the international normalized ratio (INR) when warfarin and oral terbinafine have been given concomitantly. Issued in March 2008.</p><p><strong>July 2006 </strong>— minor update. Amorolfine is now available to buy over-the-counter and the text has been amended to reflect this. Issued in July 2006.</p><p><strong>October to December 2005 </strong>— written. Validated in March 2006 and issued in May 2006. This guidance superseded the CKS guidance on <em>Fungal (dermatophyte) infections — skin and nails </em>and <em>Candida — skin and nails</em>, which were withdrawn.</p><!-- end field 76e467c0-31e7-401f-aeca-56718246657c --><!-- end item 1a6fed35-b1da-45f6-bc97-279c1318cc78 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
