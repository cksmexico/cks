A single nail, several, or rarely all nails may be affected. The first and fifth toenails are most commonly involved. Fingernail infection is usually unilateral. Different presentations of onychomycosis include:<ul><li>Superficial white — small flaky white patches and pits on the top of the nail plate; the nail becomes roughened and friable as infection spreads to the deeper layers of nail. Most common in children.</li><li>Distal — begins distally and spreads to the nail plate and nail bed; the end of the nail is lifted up, and the free edge erodes. As infection spreads proximally, may cause linear channels or 'spikes'. May be associated with <em>Candida</em> infection.</li><li>Lateral — white or yellow opaque streaks along one side of the nail.</li><li>Proximal — white or yellow spots appear in the lunula, the proximal growing end of the nail. Debris may accumulate under the proximal portion of the nail, causing onycholysis and a white discoloration that spreads distally. Most cases involve the toenails.</li><li>Subungual hyperkeratosis — scaling under the distal nail; the nail is discoloured, opaque, and thickened.</li><li>Endonyx — infection of the nail plate with white discolouration, in the absence of onycholysis and subungual hyperkeratosis.</li><li>Total dystrophic — marked thickening and hyperkeratosis; the nail plate is almost completely destroyed. Primary total dystrophy is rare, is usually caused by <em>Candida</em> infection, and typically affects immunocompromised people.</li><li>Associated with paronychia — usually, proximal nail fold infection with painful redness and swelling of the periungual skin, and possible pus collection. Typically pressure on and movement of the nail is painful. <em>Candida</em> infection is likely. See the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/paronychia-acute/\">Paronychia - acute</a> for more information.</li></ul></li><li>Note: some nails have features from a combination of different classes.
