A primary episode can last up to 20 days, and is often more severe than a recurrent episode.</li><li>Following primary infection, the virus becomes latent in local sensory ganglia.</li></ul></li><li>Recurrent genital herpes refers to a recurrence of clinical symptoms due to reactivation of pre-existent HSV infection after a latent period.<ul><li>People typically present with painful blisters or ulcers unilaterally in a single anatomical site, and prodromal tingling and burning symptoms may precede the development of lesions by hours or days.</li><li>Systemic symptoms such as fever and malaise are less common than initial episodes, and recurrent attacks are usually less severe, lasting between 5–10 days.</li></ul></li><li>Genital herpes simplex is one of the most common STIs, with up to 23% of adults in the UK and US having antibodies to HSV-2.<ul><li>In England in 2015 there were 30,658 case of genital herpes simplex diagnosed in sexual health clinics — 41% were in those aged 15–24 years.</li></ul></li><li>HSV transmission is by direct contact with an infected person who is shedding virus from secretions on oral, genital, or anal mucosal surfaces. Genital herpes can also be acquired from contact with lesions at other anatomical sites, such as the mouth, eyes, and other non-mucosal surfaces (such as herpetic whitlow on fingers or skin lesions).</li><li>Most genital herpes infections are acquired sub-clinically (asymptomatically) — at least 80% of people with proven HSV are unaware that they have been infected.</li><li>Ideally, all people with suspected genital herpes should be referred to a specialist in genito-urinary medicine for diagnosis, treatment, screening for STIs, counselling, and follow-up.<ul><li>If this is not possible or acceptable, the person should be managed in primary care if the appropriate expertise is available. </li></ul></li><li>For initial episodes, treatment with oral aciclovir (200 mg five times a day) should be started within 5 days of the start of the episode or while new lesions are forming. This should be continued for 5-10 days, or longer if new lesions are still forming while on treatment.</li><li>Management of recurrent episodes may involve:<ul><li>Self-care measures (for example topical anaesthetic, increasing fluid intake to produce dilute urine). These alone may be helpful for some people.</li><li>Episodic antiviral treatment (for example, oral aciclovir 200 mg five times a day for 5 days). This is an option if attacks are infrequent (less than six attacks per year). Self-initiated treatment should be considered, so antiviral medication can be started early in the next attack.</li><li>Suppressive antiviral treatment (for example, oral aciclovir 400 mg twice a day for 6–12 months). This is an option if attacks are frequent (six or more attacks per year), causing psychological distress, or affecting the person's social life.</li></ul></li><li>Management of recurrent episodes in people with HIV may require doubling the dose of antiviral, or extending the treatment period.</li><li>Referral should be considered in the following circumstances:<ul><li>Women who are pregnant. </li><li>Immunocompromised people (people with HIV can be treated in primary care provided that the infection is uncomplicated and not severe).</li><li>There is no response to treatment (for example, if lesions are still forming after 3–5 days of treatment).</li><li>People with herpetic proctitis, severe local secondary infection, complications (for example urinary retention) and systemic herpes infection (for example meningitis).</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 13d6a4d2-4e20-44b5-a259-8ba268a28f36 --><!-- end item 3acb72de-c84e-4ab9-a312-c462ed1448d9 -->","topic":{"id":"ea9192a7-1cda-514b-8960-509d26282765","topicId":"501ea0cd-acdf-4cd7-bab7-e2043816027a","topicName":"Herpes simplex -
