This results in impaired lymphatic and venous drainage from the appendix, with eventual ischaemia and necrosis, and potential perforation.</li></ul></li><li>Acute appendicitis is the most common abdominal surgical emergency in the world, with around 50,000 acute appendicectomies performed annually in the UK.<ul><li>It can occur at any age, with peak incidence usually in the second or third decade of life, with reduced prevalence at the extremes of age.</li></ul></li><li>Appendicitis may be uncomplicated (non-perforating) or complicated (perforating).<ul><li>A delay or misdiagnosis of appendicitis can result in additional severe complications from perforation, such as abscess formation, peritonitis, sepsis, intra-abdominal adhesions, and bowel obstruction.</li></ul></li><li>Although the natural progression of acute appendicitis results in perforation, not all cases follow this course and some will resolve spontaneously.</li><li>A diagnosis of appendicitis should be suspected if there is:<ul><li>Periumbilical or epigastric pain that worsens, and migrates to the right lower quadrant over 24–48 hours. It is typically aggravated by movement.</li><li>Low-grade fever, general malaise, and anorexia.</li><li>Nausea, vomiting, and sometimes constipation or diarrhoea.</li><li>Tenderness in the right lower quadrant on abdominal examination, which may be worse on coughing or hopping in children.</li><li>Abdominal distension, guarding, rebound tenderness or percussion tenderness, or absent bowel sounds (which may all suggest peritonitis).</li><li>A palpable abdominal mass (which may suggest an appendix mass or abscess).</li><li>Note: appendicitis may present atypically, particularly in the very young, elderly, and in pregnancy, and the anatomical position of the appendix may vary resulting in different clinical presentations.</li></ul></li><li>Management of a person with suspected appendicitis involves:<ul><li>Emergency admission for specialist assessment and management, such as further imaging and non-operative (antibiotics) or operative management (appendicectomy or percutaneous drainage of appendix abscess, for example).</li></ul></li><li>Management of a person where appendicitis is unlikely involves:<ul><li>Considering additional investigations in primary care to exclude alternative conditions, depending on clinical judgement.</li><li>Advising the person and/or parents of symptoms to be aware of, and when to seek urgent medical review.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field ed218b63-3c67-49de-add4-e3b06ff0d185 --><!-- end item cb6c1a4e-80dc-45c9-80e5-a19add29452f -->","topic":{"id":"34a7018e-bdb2-5fb9-8f39-14b87cb77872","topicId":"38888cc0-af2f-4224-93a9-2ffe35d3793c","topicName":"Appendicitis","slug":"appendicitis","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"c3867ccc-2088-5ea2-a8b8-c8a8fa3b1495","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"cadf0862-729f-56ee-b5c8-c92c5a72cbb5","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"efd5c1ac-3b3a-5b2c-82d5-19cda81e37fe","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"5c0768a7-4653-5b13-9bdd-b0696c5ea29a","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"1c4d3384-d57f-500b-ac6c-5360cef5f665","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"665f1a5d-97d4-56f8-a6d9-9fccc1bb162b","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"2b7bc994-71ff-5c70-9d2d-e88756d8ebeb","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"6546ce13-0da8-59ad-8062-384d7dc545ec","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"8fd8907b-64f5-5949-a722-c92fde97c4e7","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"4094c54b-d832-5e5d-893b-0ee5418989a6","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"0cacff5e-d8d9-5053-b381-6f678b14f8c0","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
