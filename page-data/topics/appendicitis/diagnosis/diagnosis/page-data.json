The challenge of establishing a diagnosis based on clinical presentation is supported by the WSES guidelines, which note the wide possible range of symptoms and severity of presentation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Di Saverio, 2020</a>]. Expert opinion in a review article also highlights that there is no single symptom or sign that accurately predicts perforated appendicitis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Howell, 2018</a>].</li><li>The EAES guideline notes that accurate diagnosis of suspected appendicitis is important, as a delay in time to appendicectomy increases the risk of perforation, which is associated with higher incidence of short- and long-term morbidity [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Gorter, 2016</a>]. This is supported by two systematic reviews on diagnostic accuracy, which state a prompt diagnosis can reduce the risk of complications [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Benabbas, 2017</a>], but diagnosis remains a challenge as clinical signs or positive blood results can be absent in 55% of affected people [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Kabir, 2017</a>]. Similarly, expert opinion in a review article notes that diagnosing acute appendicitis accurately and efficiently can reduce morbidity and mortality from perforation and other complications [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Synder, 2018</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article notes that a timely diagnosis of acute appendicitis in young children is a challenge owing to the rarity of the disease, the varied presentation, and the rapid development of complications [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Marzuillo, 2015</a>].</li></ul><h4>Clinical features on history taking</h4><ul><li>The information on the typical presenting symptoms of appendicitis is based on the EAES guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Gorter, 2016</a>], the WSES consensus guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Di Saverio, 2020</a>], and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Marzuillo, 2015</a>;

<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Stringer, 2017</a>].</li><li>The information about possible 'stump appendicitis' in people with a history of appendicectomy is based on the EAES guideline, which notes the diagnosis may be missed or delayed, leading to an increased risk of perforation, owing to the assumption that the appendix as a whole has been previously resected [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Gorter, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Clinical features on examination</h4><ul><li>Expert opinion in a review article notes that abdominal pain is the most common presenting feature of acute appendicitis, but highlights that the classic picture of central pain migrating to the right lower quadrant associated with nausea, vomiting, and anorexia occurs in less than half of presentations [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Baird, 2017</a>].<ul><li>The information on the typical findings on abdominal examination, including right lower quadrant pain with coughing, hopping, or percussion in children is based on the WSES consensus guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Di Saverio, 2020</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The information on the clinical features suggesting local or generalized peritonism is based on the joint WSES and Italian Societies guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Fugazzola, 2020</a>] together with expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Reust, 2016</a>;

<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Stringer, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The information on the presentation of appendix mass or abscess is based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Bhangu, 2015</a>].</li><li>The information on the possible value of testing for specific peritoneal signs that increase the likelihood of appendicitis when present, is based on expert opinion in a review article, which found that positive signs were most reliable for ruling in acute appendicitis in children [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Synder, 2018</a>]. CKS notes, however, that an additional review article states that Rovsing's and the Psoas sign are of limited diagnostic value for acute appendicitis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Baird, 2017</a>].</li><li>Overall, a systematic review of 21 variable-quality studies of children presenting with abdominal pain to emergency departments (n = 8605) found that pain migration to the right lower quadrant and the finding of cough/hop pain on examination were most strongly associated with a diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Rovsing's sign was the physical examination finding most strongly associated with the diagnosis. None of the history, physical examination, laboratory findings, or paediatric clinical scoring systems alone could rule in or rule out acute appendicitis in people with undifferentiated abdominal pain, or those with suspected acute appendicitis. In addition, the authors noted that most studies were at high risk of bias [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Benabbas, 2017</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to perform a groin and scrotal examination is based on expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Reust, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Stringer, 2017</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to perform a pelvic examination if an alternative gynaecological cause is suspected is based on expert opinion in a review article, which notes that cervical motion tenderness on bimanual examination alone is not specific to a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease, as it may be present in 25% of cases of appendicitis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Bhavsar, 2016</a>]. This approach is supported by expert opinion in an additional review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Bhangu, 2015</a>].</li><li>The recommendation not to routinely perform a rectal examination in primary care is based on expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Bhavsar, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Stringer, 2017</a>]. It is also pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice, as this may also be performed in secondary care, and the person may find it distressing to experience the procedure more than once.<ul><li>Rectal examination was shown to be only 49% sensitive and 61% specific for appendicitis, and therefore may only add to discomfort without providing useful information [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Bhavsar, 2016</a>].</li><li>Rectal examination is rarely necessary or useful except if there is concern about pelvic pathology [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Stringer, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Possible atypical presentations</h4><ul><li>The WSES guidelines note that as the value of individual clinical variables to determine the likelihood of acute appendicitis in a person is low, a tailored individualized approach is recommended, depending on disease probability, sex, and age of the person [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Di Saverio, 2020</a>].</li><li>The information on the possible presentation in children is based on the WSES guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Di Saverio, 2020</a>], two systematic reviews on diagnostic accuracy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Benabbas, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Kabir, 2017</a>], and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Bhangu, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Marzuillo, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Rentea, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Stringer, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Howell, 2018</a>].<ul><li>Expert opinion in a review article notes that classic symptoms and signs are present in less than 50% of children with acute appendicitis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Rentea, 2017</a>].</li><li>In pre-school age children, acute appendicitis often presents with atypical features, more rapid progression, and higher incidence of complications [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Di Saverio, 2020</a>]. Younger children are less able to articulate their symptoms, may present with non-specific and atypical symptoms, and a retrospective study found perforation rates were high in this age group [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Howell, 2018</a>]. Similarly, another review article notes that pre-school children are more likely to present late, with atypical features, or be associated with complications such as perforation or an appendix mass [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Stringer, 2017</a>].</li><li>In children, abdominal pain is a common presentation in the absence of appendicitis, and the presentation of true appendicitis can be highly atypical [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Kabir, 2017</a>].</li><li>Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial but challenging owing to atypical presentations and the inherent difficulty of obtaining a reliable history and physical examination in younger children [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Benabbas, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The information on the possible presentation in older people is based on the joint WSES and Italian Societies guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Fugazzola, 2020</a>] and expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Bhangu, 2015</a>].<ul><li>Appendicitis may not present typically in older people, and co-morbidity and concurrent medication may further complicate the diagnosis.

An increase of a single blood marker should not be relied on to indicate appendicitis, and a combination of positive markers increases the likelihood of an accurate diagnosis of appendicitis, however, it notes that they are non-specific markers of inflammation. CRP is a strong predictor for complicated or late-stage appendicitis, but is limited in helping early diagnosis. Many included studies were limited by secondary and post-hoc analyses [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Kabir, 2017</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article notes that individually, the WBC count and inflammatory markers lack accuracy for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, however, laboratory tests may be helpful when combined with clinical signs and symptoms in clinical decision rules, or in combination with imaging studies in hospital [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Synder, 2018</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in additional review articles highlights the value of a full blood count, urine pregnancy test, and urine dipstick test in ruling out alternative conditions [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Bhangu, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Bhavsar, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Reust, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Baird, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Stringer, 2017</a>]. In particular, one review article notes there are no specific blood tests for appendicitis, but if the WBC count, CRP level, granulocyte count, or proportion of polymorphonuclear cells are raised, a diagnosis of appendicitis is more likely. If these results are normal, then a diagnosis is less likely [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Baird, 2017</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in another review article notes that up to 20% of children with histologically confirmed appendicitis present with a WBC in the normal range, and notes that both WBC count and CRP may lead to enhanced negative predictive value in ruling out the diagnosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Marzuillo, 2015</a>].</li><li>The information that 40% of people with acute appendicitis have leucocytes on urine dipstick testing is based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Baird, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li><li>CKS notes the use of various clinical scoring systems in the literature that aim to help predict the risk of acute appendicitis using a combination of clinical features on history and examination, and laboratory findings [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Gorter, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Baird, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Synder, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Di Saverio, 2020</a>]. Their use is not routinely recommended in primary care as the reported sensitivity and specificity of these scoring systems vary widely between studies [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/appendicitis/references/\">Benabbas, 2017</a>], and there may be a delay in obtaining laboratory results in primary care, which affects the decision to arrange hospital admission.
