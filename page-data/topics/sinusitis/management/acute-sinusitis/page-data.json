<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">Peters et al, 2014</a>].  </li></ul><h5>When to prescribe an antibiotic</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on when to prescribe an antibiotic are based on the NICE guidance on <em>Sinusitis (acute): antimicrobial prescribing </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>]. <ul><li>Acute sinusitis usually follows a common cold, and symptoms for less than around 10 days are more commonly associated with a cold rather than viral or bacterial acute sinusitis. Prolonged symptoms (for around 10 days or more with no improvement) can be caused by either viral (more likely) or bacterial acute sinusitis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].  </li><li>It is of note that a tiny proportion of viral sinusitis is complicated by bacterial infection (0.5–2.2%), and even bacterial sinusitis is usually self-limiting and does not routinely need antibiotics [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].  </li><li>For people not receiving an antibiotic, NICE recognises that people with symptoms that worsen rapidly or significantly should be reassessed to rule out alternative diagnoses and to identify any signs or symptoms suggesting a more serious illness or condition [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>], but severe complications in healthy adults and children with acute sinusitis are rare (1:32,000 and 1:12,000 respectively) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">Hansen et al, 2012</a>]. </li></ul></li><li>Back up antibiotic prescription is recommended by NICE based on low to moderate RCT evidence and the expert opinion of the NICE committee that most self-limiting acute sinusitis episodes would be starting to resolve after seven days and back up antibiotics may be preferred if a bacterial cause is considered to be more likely based on a number of factors [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Antibiotic efficacy</h5><ul><li>For adults, NICE found very low quality evidence from three systematic reviews and meta-analyses<strong> </strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">Falagas et al, 2008</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">Rosenfeld et al, 2007</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">Ahovuo-Saloranta, 2014</a>] that antibiotics, when compared with placebo, did not significantly increase the proportion of people in whom symptoms were cured or improved at 3–5 days follow up. At 7–15 days follow up, moderate quality evidence showed a statistically significant difference in effectiveness, but the clinical difference was small. This was not evident in the longer term [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>]. </li><li>For children, two systematic reviews [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">Falagas et al, 2008</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">Cronin et al, 2013</a>] had conflicting results, with one (low-quality evidence) showing symptom improvement at 10–14 days with antibiotics compared with placebo. The other found moderate quality evidence to suggest no significant increase in cure or improvement with antibiotics compared with placebo [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].  </li></ul><h5>Self-care</h5><ul><li>NICE found no evidence on the use of paracetamol or ibuprofen for acute sinusitis, but concluded that their use was reasonable based on expert opinion and the established efficacy and safety profiles of these drugs for the management of general pain and fever [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].  A US clinical practice guideline for adult sinusitis considered over-the-counter analgesics such as paracetamol or ibuprofen to be sufficient to relieve the facial pain of acute sinusitis and discouraged the use of stronger analgesics [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">Rosenfeld et al, 2015</a>].<ul><li>The effectiveness of ibuprofen in the symptomatic relief of the common cold has been confirmed by a Cochrane review of nine RCTs (n = 1069) which investigated the efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of symptoms associated with the common cold and concluded that NSAIDs were effective in relieving discomfort, but the effect on respiratory symptoms was less certain [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">Kim et al, 2015</a>]. It seems reasonable to extrapolate these data to the management of sinusitis, which has similar symptoms to the common cold.</li></ul></li><li>NICE found insufficient evidence on the use of nasal saline or decongestants to recommend their use but was of the opinion, on the basis of experience, that people with sinusitis and nasal congestion may wish to try them [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].  A US practice parameter update also discussed symptomatic measures and noted that the use of nasal irrigations and decongestants in children has not been found to be beneficial [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">Peters et al, 2014</a>].</li></ul><h5>Intranasal corticosteroids</h5><ul><li>The choice of, and dose, of nasal corticosteroid, is based on recommendations from, and evidence reviewed by, NICE [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>] and is supported by Public Health England recommendations in their publication <em>Management and treatment of common infections. Antibiotic guidance for primary care</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">PHE, 2017</a>]. </li><li>There is high-quality evidence from a Cochrane systematic review that high-dose intranasal corticosteroids are effective at relieving symptoms of acute sinusitis compared with placebo (73% compared with 66%; risk ratio 1.11; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.18). Lower doses did not show a statistically significant improvement in symptoms compared with placebo [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">Zalmanovici Trestioreanu and Yaphe, 2013</a>].</li><li>Based on this evidence, NICE recommends that intranasal corticosteroids are considered in adults and children over the age of 12 with more prolonged or severe symptoms (more than 10 days), when their modest effectiveness (number needed to treat =17) may be considered beneficial, taking into account the potential systemic effects [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Follow up</h5><ul><li>The recommendations advising people when to seek medical advice and when to reassess are largely based on the NICE guideline <em>Sinusitis (acute): antimicrobial prescribing </em>which advises referring people with sinusitis to hospital if they have a severe systemic infection or orbital or intracranial complications [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].  </li><li>US guidelines and a practice parameter update for adults and children also advise following up a person with acute sinusitis if their symptoms worsen, or do not improve within 3–5 days of treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">Wald et al, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">Peters et al, 2014</a>]. Follow up allows exclusion of other causes of illness, underlying factors such as nasal polyps or tumours, identification of complications, and assessment of compliance with treatment, and gives the opportunity to refer to an ear nose and throat specialist, if necessary, with appropriate urgency [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">Bird et al, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\"

College of Surgeons, 2016</a>].  </li></ul><h5>Referral </h5><ul><li>The recommendation to refer people with recurrent acute sinusitis is based on a European position paper on rhinosinusitis and nasal

based on the NICE guidance on <em>Sinusitis (acute): antimicrobial prescribing </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>] and are consistent with the Public Health England document <em>Management and treatment of common infections: Antibiotic guidance for primary care </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">PHE, 2017</a>] and the British National Formulary (BNF) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">BNF 75, 2018</a>]. <ul><li>The NICE committee found no major difference in clinical effectiveness between different groups of antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides, tetracyclines, folate inhibitors, and quinolones) based on evidence from two systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs in adults (very low to moderate quality) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">Karageorgopoulos et al, 2008</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">Ahovuo-Saloranta, 2014</a>]. Therefore NICE concluded that the choice of antibiotic should take into consideration the risk of resistance, as well as other factors affecting adherence such as dosing schedule [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li><li>Phenoxymethylpenicillin and amoxicillin were found to have similar results in terms of cure and improvement at 10 days (two RCTs from the systematic reviews; moderate to high quality evidence) and 14 to 16 days (one RCT from the systematic reviews; moderate quality evidence). For duration of illness, no significant difference was found in two RCTs; in one RCT moderate-quality evidence showed a significantly shorter duration of illness with either amoxicillin or phenoxymethylpenicillin, compared with placebo. Phenoxymethylpenicillin is the preferred option for non-life-threatening infections as it has a lower risk of resistance than amoxicillin, due to its narrower spectrum of activity [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>]. </li><li>Doxycycline, erythromycin, or clarithromycin are recommended based on the expert opinion of the NICE guideline development group who considered the evidence, clinical experience and resistance data [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>]. </li><li>NICE recommends using co-amoxiclav in people who are very unwell, have symptoms and signs of a more serious illness or condition, or are at high risk of complications. Taking into account resistance data and clinical experience, the NICE committee were of the opinion that infection in these groups was more likely to be resistant to phenoxymethylpenicillin, therefore co-amoxiclav offers an advantage as is it active against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].  </li></ul></li></ul><h5>Second-line antibiotic choice</h5><ul><li>NICE found evidence to support a recommendation to prescribe co-amoxiclav if symptoms worsen after 2–3 days and discussed the likelihood of phenoxymethylpenicillin resistance in this group. The recommendation to seek specialist advice from a microbiologist is based on expert opinion [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].  </li></ul><h5>Antibiotic duration and dose</h5><ul><li>NICE took into account efficacy, safety, and resistance data and recommends a 5-day course of high-dose antibiotics [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>] based on high-quality evidence from a systematic review which found no difference in cure or improvement when a short course (3–7 days) was compared with a longer course (6–10 days) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">Falagas et al, 2009</a>].  </li><li>Although studies of penicillin for sinusitis used higher doses than those recommended by NICE, the guideline development group took into account the availability of dose formulations in the UK when making their recommendations. The doses of co-amoxiclav, doxycycline, and clarithromycin are consistent with those used in the supporting evidence, and the recommended erythromycin dose is based on expert consensus opinion [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>]. Doses also reflect those in the British National Formulary [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sinusitis/references/\">BNF 75, 2018</a>]. </li></ul><!-- end field 262b80c4-6e91-4cda-9c95-a8e000d40458 --><!-- end item 886654ce-69b5-425d-b114-a8e000d40458 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
