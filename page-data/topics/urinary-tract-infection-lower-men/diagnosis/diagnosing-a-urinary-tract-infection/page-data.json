Evidence from studies of women cannot simply be extrapolated [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/urinary-tract-infection-lower-men/references/\">SIGN, 2012</a>].  </li></ul><h4>Dipstick testing</h4><ul><li>Symptomatic UTI cannot be differentiated from asymptomatic bacteriuria on the basis of urine analysis with dipstick tests [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/urinary-tract-infection-lower-men/references/\">SIGN, 2012</a>].</li><li>Urine dipstick tests can help decide if a temporary working diagnosis of UTI should be made [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/urinary-tract-infection-lower-men/references/\">COMPASS, 2012</a>]. <ul><li>If a urine dipstick test is positive for both nitrite and leukocyte esterase, UTI is very likely.</li><li>If the dipstick test is negative or equivocal, use clinical judgement to decide if a working diagnosis of UTI should be made whilst awaiting urine culture results.<ul><li>A negative urine dipstick result does not rule out UTI because some uropathogens do not reduce nitrate to nitrite (producing a positive test result). The detection of leukocyte esterase in the urine is a marker for pyuria, but white blood cells may be present in non-infective inflammatory processes, such as urinary tuberculosis, therefore a positive result does not confirm the presence of a UTI. Similarly, a negative leukocyte esterase test does not always rule out UTI as infection is not always associated with pyuria.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Dipstick tests should not be used in men with an indwelling urinary catheter as they will not differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria and leukocytes are often falsely positive due to a foreign body reaction to catheter material [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/urinary-tract-infection-lower-men/references/\">COMPASS, 2012</a>].</li><li>Dipstick testing should not be used in men aged over 65 years as they become more unreliable with increasing age over 65 years. Up to half of older adults, and most with a urinary catheter, will have bacteria present in the bladder/urine without an infection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/urinary-tract-infection-lower-men/references/\">PHE, 2018a</a>]. </li><li>Pyuria is common in catheterised people and its level has no predictive value. There is no evidence to suggest that detecting pyuria by urine analysis is of any value in differentiating symptomatic UTI from asymptomatic UTI (bacteriuria) in catheterised people [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/urinary-tract-infection-lower-men/references/\">SIGN, 2012</a>]. </li></ul><p><strong>Culture in men with indwelling catheters </strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/urinary-tract-infection-lower-men/references/\">PHE, 2018b</a>]</p><ul><li>In men with indwelling catheters, samples may not accurately reflect the true bladder pathogen, and the criteria have not been established for differentiating asymptomatic colonisation of the urinary tract from symptomatic infection.<ul><li>The quality of the specimen collected and clinical circumstances in the individual patient are critical in the interpretation of bacterial counts. In carefully collected specimens, taken under controlled study conditions in short-term catheterised people, counts of less than 10<sup>5</sup> colony forming units (CFU)/mL have been shown to be significant.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 8024803a-f15d-40d2-8aab-60688fdd263b --><!-- end item b96ef7db-ee4f-4f64-bc20-a6a3e95a9313 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
