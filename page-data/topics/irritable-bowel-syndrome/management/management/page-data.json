No significant heterogeneity between studies was noted, however there were differences in the study definitions of IBS used, different settings and durations of therapy. It concludes that fibre supplementation is inexpensive and generally safe, and should remain a first-line approach for the management of people with IBS [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/references/\">Moayyedi, 2014</a>].</li><li>The BDA guidelines state that linseeds are a useful source of dietary fibre, which should be consumed with plenty of fluid [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/references/\">McKenzie, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Advice on adjusting dietary triggers</h5><ul><li>The recommendation on modifying diet is based on the BDA statement that up to 90% of people report that foods (such as alcohol, caffeine, spicy and fatty food) trigger IBS symptoms [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/references/\">McKenzie, 2016</a>].<ul><li>Alcohol can induce or worsen IBS symptoms by affecting gastrointestinal motility, absorption, and intestinal permeability.</li><li>Caffeine increases gastric acid secretion and colonic motor activity.</li><li>Fatty foods affect small intestinal motility and stimulate the gastrocolic reflex, which may lead to spontaneous bowel movements in people with IBS.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Advice on a trial of probiotics</h5><ul><li>The evidence for the use of probiotics (microbial food supplements) is limited, and conflicting from low-quality trials which use different species, strains, preparations (capsules, powders, fermented milks and yoghurts), and doses of probiotic supplements in the literature.<ul><li>The NICE clinical guideline found good-quality evidence that combination probiotics significantly improve global IBS symptoms, pain, and bloating compared with placebo, however this is probiotic dose- and strain-dependent. The guideline development group felt unable to recommend named bacteria or probiotic products, however it concluded they were a reasonable self-management option for people with IBS, and were unlikely to be harmful [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>]. </li><li>The BDA guidelines found limited evidence of benefit from probiotics, and noted the potential for a placebo response in clinical trials. The BDA concluded that if a person finds four weeks of probiotic use beneficial, they can continue to take it, but the long-term effects are not known [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/references/\">McKenzie, 2016</a>].</li><li>This is supported by a meta-analysis of 18 RCTs (n = 1650) on the efficacy of probiotics in the treatment of IBS, which found probiotics were associated with a significant reduction in IBS symptoms and improvement in pain scores compared with placebo, however there was significant heterogeneity between studies in clinical outcomes, and different strains and species of probiotics were used.

In addition, it cites moderate-quality evidence from five RCTs (n = 482) that peppermint oil is superior to placebo in improving IBS symptoms, however it notes significant heterogeneity between results [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/references/\">Ford, 2014a</a>].</li><li>A large Cochrane systematic review of 29 RCTs (n = 2333) found a beneficial effect of antispasmodic agents such as peppermint oil over placebo for outcomes of improvement in abdominal pain, global assessment, and symptom score, with a low risk of bias in the studies [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/references/\">Ruepert et al, 2011</a>].</li><li>This is supported by a subsequent systematic review of nine RCTs (n = 726) of a minimum 2-week duration, that found peppermint oil significantly improved global IBS symptoms and abdominal pain compared with placebo.

It found, however, low-quality evidence that SSRIs provided no significant improvement in global symptoms, and does not recommend these as a treatment option [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/references/\">Weinberg, 2014</a>]. The AGA technical review notes, however, that SSRIs may improve the perception of overall IBS symptoms and wellbeing by their effect on pain perception, mood, and extra-intestinal symptoms [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/references/\">Chang, 2014</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Arranging referral to gastroenterology</h5><ul><li>The recommendation on considering referral to a specialist if symptoms are refractory to primary care management or there is diagnostic uncertainty is based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/references/\">Ford, 2012</a>] and is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><h5>Arranging referral to a dietitian</h5><ul><li>The recommendation on referral to a dietitian is based on the NICE clinical guideline, which recommends further dietary management if general lifestyle and dietary advice has not helped. This includes possible trials of single food avoidance and exclusion diets, such as a low-FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) diet, under specialist supervision [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].<ul><li>A diet high in FODMAPs is theorized to cause IBS symptoms by increasing small intestinal luminal fluid and gas production via colonic microbial fermentation, as well as their direct effects on gastrointestinal motility [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/references/\">Halland, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/references/\">McKenzie, 2016</a>].</li><li>The NICE guideline notes that excluding individual foods or complete food groups without appropriate supervision can lead to inadequate nutrient intake and ultimately potential malnutrition. In addition, symptoms often remain unresolved leading to further inappropriate dietary restriction. NICE therefore recommends that exclusion diets should only be undertaken by a specialist with dietary expertise, to ensure that the person's diet remains balanced and nutritious [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li><li>This approach is supported by the BDA guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/references/\">McKenzie, 2016</a>].<ul><li>This guideline recommends dietitian referral in order to avoid unnecessary food exclusion and potential dietary deficiencies.</li><li>The BDA found a low-FODMAP diet for 3, 4, or 6 weeks improved overall IBS symptoms, specifically in people with diarrhoea-predominant and mixed-type IBS, and recommended this was delivered by a dietitian with expertise in FODMAP education.</li></ul></li><li>In addition, a systematic review of dietary interventions in IBS found very low-quality evidence from one small crossover RCT (n = 45) comparing a low-FODMAP diet with a normal diet over a short 21-day follow-up period. It concluded that a low-FODMAP diet may be more effective at improving symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and dissatisfaction with stool consistency, however this intervention was of unknown clinical effectiveness [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/references/\">Ford, 2015</a>], and CKS notes there are few long-term efficacy or safety data for this intervention.</li></ul><h5>Arranging referral for psychological support</h5><ul><li>The NICE clinical guideline recommends referral for possible cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), hypnotherapy, and/or psychotherapy for people with refractory IBS symptoms, as it found these were cost-effective options [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li><li>A Cochrane systematic review of 25 low-quality randomized studies of psychological interventions such as CBT, interpersonal psychotherapy, relaxation therapy or stress management compared with usual care for people with IBS, found that CBT and interpersonal psychotherapy may be effective immediately after finishing the intervention, however these therapies are only marginally superior to no treatment. In addition, it is uncertain whether they have a sustained effect, and the meta-analysis was limited by the small study sample sizes, different outcome definitions, and heterogeneity between the studies [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/irritable-bowel-syndrome/references/\">Zijdenbos et al, 2009</a>].</li><li>A subsequent systematic review of very low-quality evidence from 32 trials (n = 2189) on different psychological therapies to treat IBS found interventions including CBT, multicomponent psychological therapy, and dynamic psychotherapy were all beneficial.
