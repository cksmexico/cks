It has two functions â€” to prevent foreign material entering the lower respiratory tract, and to clear secretions from the lungs and airways.</li><li>Cough in people with cancer is most commonly associated with cancer of the airways, lungs, pleura, and mediastinum, but tumours metastasizing to the thorax can also cause cough.</li><li>In people with cancer, the most common cause of acute cough is respiratory tract infection. Other possible non-malignant causes include post-nasal drip, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.</li><li>When assessing someone with cough in palliative care, the following should be elicited:<ul><li>The impact on the person's quality of life.</li><li>The severity, time of onset, and duration of the cough.</li><li>The pattern and character of the cough.</li><li>Any associated symptoms, such as nasal discharge, sputum, blood, or breathlessness.</li></ul></li><li>When examining someone with cough in palliative care, features to help determine the underlying cause should be identified, such as:<ul><li>Increased respiratory rate, decreased chest wall movement, breath sounds, wheeze, stridor, or crepitations.</li></ul></li><li>The appropriateness of investigation and treatment should be considered against the prognosis, the likely benefit of treatment, and the person's wishes:<ul><li>Treatment of infection with antibiotics, drainage of effusions, and radiotherapy to tumour masses or lymphadenopathy may provide symptomatic relief and improve quality of life.</li><li>Symptomatic treatment can be considered if treating the underlying cause is not possible, the person remains distressed by symptoms, or the person is in the terminal phase of life.</li><li>Management of other physical symptoms, and the psychological, social, and spiritual needs of the person and their family should be considered.</li></ul></li><li>Managing symptomatic cough in palliative care can be done by a stepwise approach:<ul><li>Simple measures, such as humidified room air, or simple linctus.</li><li>A weak opioid cough suppressant, such as codeine linctus.</li><li>A strong opioid cough suppressant, such as morphine.</li><li>Measures to encourage expectoration in people with moist cough and an effective cough mechanism, such as nebulized saline solution or a mucolytic.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 87acf225-454c-492c-a6d6-219f34629191 --><!-- end item 1805345a-634a-4862-bc33-27b8690727fc -->","topic":{"id":"d321ef5c-4612-5a6b-aafc-a656ec8fb1e6","topicId":"561865b5-2a09-480f-ae63-783b229b69bf","topicName":"Palliative care -
