Instead an 'as required' dose of morphine solution should be used to relieve cough and, if this is beneficial, continue to use in this way, or increase the regular morphine dose [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-cough/references/\">Twycross, 2014</a>].</li><li>Codeine 15 to 30 mg 4 hourly as required can be used for symptomatic relief of unproductive coughs. This can be given either as a cough syrup (Codeine Linctus BP 5 to 10 ml) or tablets.</li><li>When using codeine as a cough suppressant, advised about the possible adverse effects:<ul><li>Constipation — Co-prescribe laxatives (for example a regular stimulant laxative). For further information on preventing constipation when prescribing opioids see the section <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-constipation/management/management/#preventing-constipation\">preventing constipation </a> in the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-constipation/\">Palliative care - constipation</a>.<ul><li>Drowsiness — codeine has mild sedative properties and people should be warned to avoid activities where drowsiness may be detrimental.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>If codeine is ineffective, switch to morphine solution 5 mg to 10 mg every 4 hours and 'as required'. For people who are opioid naive, start at a dose of 2.5 to 5 mg every 4 hours.</li><li>Advise all people about driving if they are taking opioids, for example [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-cough/references/\">Department for Transport, 2014</a>]:<ul><li>You should not drive if you feel drowsy, dizzy, unable to concentrate or make decisions, or if you have blurred or double vision.</li><li>It is now an offence to drive if you have more than a specified amount of opioid in your body whether your driving is impaired or not.</li><li>Roadside drug screening tests have been introduced into the UK since March 2015. These test the saliva for drugs that impair driving. If you have a positive roadside drug test for opioids, the police may ask you to provide a blood sample to measure the amount of opioid in your body.</li><li>If you are found to have more than the specified amount of opioid, as long as your driving is not impaired, you are taking your medicine on the advice of your GP, your pharmacist, or in accordance with the patient information leaflet of an opioid that was bought over-the-counter, you will be able to raise a 'statutory defence' and the police may not prosecute you.</li><li>It may be helpful to keep evidence with you while you are driving, that you are taking an opioid in accordance with medical advice. Suitable evidence may include: your medication box with the pharmacy label on, the other half of your prescription with the list of medicines prescribed by your doctor, or the package insert if the medicine was bought over-the-counter.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-cough/references/\">ABPI Medicines Compendium, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-cough/references/\">Twycross, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-cough/references/\">ABPI Medicines Compendium, 2015a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-cough/references/\">BNF 72, 2016</a>]</p><!-- end field ed98ccea-26cd-4aa9-a6dd-7e9276c16ad6 --><!-- end item 5647ac07-4693-4d66-84fb-80de345878fc -->","topic":{"id":"d321ef5c-4612-5a6b-aafc-a656ec8fb1e6","topicId":"561865b5-2a09-480f-ae63-783b229b69bf","topicName":"Palliative care -
