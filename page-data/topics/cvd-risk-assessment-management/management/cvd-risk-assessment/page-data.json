However, the NICE surveillance report states that [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cvd-risk-assessment-management/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>]:  'The collective new evidence and topic expert feedback indicates that the inclusion of additional clinical variables in QRISK3 has a greater potential value to identify those at most risk of heart disease and stroke.'</li><li>QRISK3 was developed and validated in a prospective open cohort study [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cvd-risk-assessment-management/references/\">Hippisley-Cox, 2017</a>] which used 981 GP practices with 7.89 million patients to develop the risk scores, and 328 practices with 2.67 million patients to validate the scores. Cardiovascular disease (CVD), defined as 'a composite outcome of coronary heart disease, ischaemic stroke, or transient ischaemic attack', was the primary outcome. Three models were developed; model A contained the same variables as the 2017 version of QRISK2. Models B and C included the additional variables that met the inclusion criteria but differed in that model B did not include the standard deviation of serial systolic blood pressure values, whereas model C did. <ul><li>In total, there were 363,565 incident cases of CVD arising from 50.8 million person years of observation, during a median follow up of 4.4 years.</li><li>In terms of variation in time to diagnosis of CVD, the QRISK3 algorithm accounted for 54.8% of the variation in men and 59.6% of the variation in women for model A. Models B and C performed similarly.</li><li>In terms of calibration, defined by comparing the mean predicted risks at 10-years with the observed risk by 10th of predicted risk, the results showed that:<ul><li>The mean predicted risk was 6.4% in men, with an observed 10-year risk of 7.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.5% to 7.6%).</li><li>The mean predicted risk was 4.7% in women, with an observed 10-year risk of 5.8% (95% CI 5.8% to 5.9%).</li></ul></li><li>The study found that the models appeared to be well calibrated, and the mean predicted risks and the observed risks corresponding closely within each model and in each age group, except in those aged 25–39 where mean observed risks were marginally lower than the predicted risks.</li><li>Overall performance of the updated QRISK3 algorithms was found to be non-inferior to the QRISK2 algorithms.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Use of QRISK3 in people with diabetes mellitus, or chronic kidney disease (CKD)</h5><ul><li>NICE does not currently recommend using risk assessment tools for people with type 1 diabetes mellitus, or CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and/or albuminuria) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cvd-risk-assessment-management/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>]. However, new evidence suggests that QRISK3 performs well for people with type 1 diabetes and CKD, and may help some people with these conditions to make an informed choice on whether to take statins [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cvd-risk-assessment-management/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>]. <ul><li>The recommendation to consider using QRISK3 in these people is pragmatic.

However, any significant changes in family history or knowledge of family history might necessitate a repeat of risk assessment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cvd-risk-assessment-management/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>]. </li></ul><p><strong>Choice of risk calculator </strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cvd-risk-assessment-management/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>]</p><ul><li>NICE identified 24 studies (total populations ranged from 428 to 3,601,918) that assessed CVD risk assessment tools that have been validated in England and Wales — QRISK2, Framingham (and UKPDS which is specifically for people with type 2 diabetes).<ul><li>The evidence suggests that all the tools considered are better than chance at predicting CVD risk.</li></ul></li><li>NICE concluded that the QRISK2 and Framingham tools did not show major differences, but QRISK2 showed better performance in terms of calibration and reclassification than Framingham.<ul><li>The Framingham tool is based on a cohort of people from USA and the calibration is updated about every 3 years.
