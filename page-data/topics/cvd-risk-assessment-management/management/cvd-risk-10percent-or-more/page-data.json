The risk of vascular mortality was not changed by treatment with aspirin.</li><li>In a Japanese study (n = 14,464), people aged 60–85 years with hypertension, dyslipidaemia or diabetes mellitus were randomized to treatment with 100 mg aspirin or placebo. The 5-year cumulative primary outcome event rate (death from CV causes) was not significantly different between the groups, but treatment with aspirin significantly increased the risk of extracranial haemorrhage requiring transfusion or hospitalization (P = 0.004).</li><li>However, in a position paper, an ESC working group suggested that aspirin should be considered in the primary prevention of CVD in people at a high risk of major cardiovascular events — more than 2 per 100 subject-years, provided there is no clear evidence of increased risk of bleeding (GI bleeding or peptic ulcer disease, no concurrent use of other medications that increase bleeding risk) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cvd-risk-assessment-management/references/\">Halvorsen, 2014</a>].  <ul><li>In the absence of such conditions, people with a 10-year risk of major CV of more than 20% should be given low-dose aspirin, and people with a risk 10–20% should be considered potentially eligible.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h5>Statin use in the elderly </h5><ul><li>No trials of initiating statin therapy have specifically recruited the very elderly (people over the age of 85) and many trials define the elderly as those aged over 65 years [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cvd-risk-assessment-management/references/\">SIGN, 2017</a>]. <ul><li>One meta-analysis of 8 trials including 24,674 patients aged 65 years or over (average age 73) without established CVD concluded that statins reduce the incidence of MI (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.85) and stroke (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93) but do not significantly prolong survival. Similarly, an individual patient data analysis of major statin trials has confirmed reductions in first major cardiovascular events of 22% in those aged 66–75 and 16% in those aged over 75 per 1 mmol/l reduction in LDL cholesterol.</li></ul></li><li>There is little reliable evidence regarding the clinical effects of the cessation of statin therapy in the elderly [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cvd-risk-assessment-management/references/\">SIGN, 2017</a>]. <ul><li>However, one RCT investigating the safety and benefit of stopping statins in people aged on average 74.1 years, with advanced, life-limiting illness, found that stopping statins is safe and may be associated with benefits including improved quality of life. The proportion of participants in the discontinuation versus continuation groups who died within 60 days was not significantly different (23.8% v 20.3%, 90% CI 3.5% to 10.5%) and did not meet the non-inferiority end point. Total quality of life (QoL) was better for the group discontinuing statin therapy (mean McGill QoL score 7.11 v 6.85, p=0.04). Few participants experienced cardiovascular events (13 in the discontinuation group, 11 in the continuation group).</li></ul></li><li>There is no evidence of decreasing effectiveness of statins in patients aged over 75 years, and evidence supporting effectiveness in people aged over 80 years of age is very limited [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cvd-risk-assessment-management/references/\">ESC, 2016</a>]. </li><li>In the elderly, the decision to start statin therapy should be based on 10-year CVD risk estimation, life expectancy, and QoL. Age alone is not a contraindication to drug therapy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cvd-risk-assessment-management/references/\">SIGN, 2017</a>]. </li></ul><!-- end field f55801ec-c5d4-43c7-958c-a76c01319413 --><!-- end item 25781152-1aa9-47dd-9018-a76c01319413 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
