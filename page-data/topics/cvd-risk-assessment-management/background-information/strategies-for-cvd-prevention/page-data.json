However, there was insufficient high-quality evidence to determine whether this translated into improved CVD outcomes.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Secondary prevention of CVD</strong><ul><li>People who already have CVD can benefit from risk factor modification and cardiac rehabilitation (where appropriate).</li><li>Secondary prevention of CVD is not discussed further in this topic.

Although many people have a low or moderate risk of developing CVD, because the population is large, a small change in average risk can potentially prevent many cases of CVD.<ul><li>These strategies may seek to influence: diet, alcohol consumption, smoking and exercise, for example.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cvd-risk-assessment-management/references/\">Dong et al, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cvd-risk-assessment-management/references/\">Public Health England, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cvd-risk-assessment-management/references/\">ESC, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cvd-risk-assessment-management/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>] </p><!-- end field 278f85c4-d272-4616-bb06-a7fa0a9e2c73 --><!-- end item 2122dd9a-06d7-4c9a-a15e-b6adf52694e9 -->","topic":{"id":"523d2a2f-e844-578d-a561-3be5cbca9b75","topicId":"f6d3b04f-1af7-4be9-8156-7728560d7626","topicName":"CVD risk assessment and management","slug":"cvd-risk-assessment-management","lastRevised":"Last revised in August 2020","chapters":[{"id":"7b4828f7-b87a-5825-8965-8fdd9129683e","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"e7373cf1-b9a1-5687-9711-2cb9d9c89c69","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"792673f1-3d99-54ef-99fe-bba0e1a561a8","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"b2dea30b-fe5c-5016-a74a-657f491fbc6d","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"78c4178a-c12b-5c09-b381-a13caf2b0555","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"a448bfdb-c0ae-515d-94a0-ff7ca675cdb6","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"44aa879e-615a-5bce-88b8-8723ea0ccd5e","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"6fc1588f-7ff7-56a8-99ea-47cc099b05d5","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"1171d2a1-75d7-533d-b720-0492fc8b1eb3","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"a295e1e8-68f8-5f7f-9079-8b86314aae02","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"80b984d3-485b-5103-b839-49a12de3708b","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP - Options for local implementation"},{"id":"a72588c2-75b2-5fb4-8a3b-3a4ee9deb056","slug":"nice-quality-standards","fullItemName":"NICE quality standards"}]},{"id":"7f7061ef-3615-572d-b80c-49d0441b7029","fullItemName":"Background information","slug":"background-information","subChapters":[{"id":"7a402468-6c9d-5c65-aa94-ac4fba3efa6f","slug":"definition-of-cvd","fullItemName":"Definition of CVD"},{"id":"86b5e37a-5729-5a1a-8cdb-ce876c2f63ff","slug":"burden-of-cvd","fullItemName":"Burden of CVD"},{"id":"564a5209-6b9c-5f0d-b4e2-44fffe6a13e2","slug":"risk-factors-for-cvd","fullItemName":"Risk factors for CVD"},{"id":"95b341d8-0988-5dcd-9b67-e51b4e310ab8","slug":"strategies-for-cvd-prevention","fullItemName":"Strategies for CVD prevention"}]},{"id":"7ef7e02f-cdf3-5561-87d6-387b8c85c6fe","fullItemName":"Management","slug":"management","subChapters":[{"id":"e351979f-6e51-53cf-9377-6933a02382e6","slug":"cvd-risk-assessment","fullItemName":"Scenario: CVD risk assessment"},{"id":"fe019c79-fed9-53d2-872f-da771bf12db0","slug":"cvd-risk-less-than-10percent","fullItemName":"Scenario: CVD risk less than 10%"},{"id":"7815dd8b-1e90-5da1-8f71-d11a3b4d0454","slug":"cvd-risk-10percent-or-more","fullItemName":"Scenario: CVD risk 10% or more"}]},{"id":"4bca1eaa-45f6-5ef6-8e61-9fcdd7be2974","fullItemName":"Supporting evidence","slug":"supporting-evidence","subChapters":[]},{"id":"4365c311-267f-5090-b1a7-5ca71f0a5e8b","fullItemName":"How this topic was developed","slug":"how-this-topic-was-developed","subChapters":[{"id":"e8349012-8164-5323-bd10-3c52e461fbd4","slug":"search-strategy","fullItemName":"Search strategy"},{"id":"09e44952-956e-5e91-9f5b-b584c9c7340f","slug":"stakeholder-engagement","fullItemName":"Stakeholder engagement"},{"id":"c76818be-b774-5f66-badd-b8b17ccd0eef","slug":"evidence-exclusion-criteria","fullItemName":"Evidence exclusion criteria"},{"id":"4a06dccb-9327-5792-a92c-1c8278cab678","slug":"organizational-behavioural-financial-barriers","fullItemName":"Organizational, behavioural and financial barriers"},{"id":"ff5c3303-e844-5444-9b71-dbe2fc774f83","slug":"declarations-of-interest","fullItemName":"Declarations of interest"}]},{"id":"7a5af289-d6e5-5ded-92b0-696749f9ff11","fullItemName":"References","slug":"references","subChapters":[]}]},"parentChapter":{"id":"7f7061ef-3615-572d-b80c-49d0441b7029","slug":"background-information","fullItemName":"Background information"},"subChapters":[]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
