A literature search was conducted in June 2014 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key randomized controlled trials published since the last revision of this topic. The main significant changes made to this topic reflect the recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the guideline <em>Lipid modification: Cardiovascular risk assessment and the modification of blood lipids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease </em> and includes the following:</p><ul><li>A 10 year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk should be assessed using the QRISK2 assessment tool (and not the Framingham tool).</li><li>Statin treatment is an option for the primary prevention of CVD for people with an estimated 10 year CVD risk of 10% or more.</li><li>Atorvastatin 20 mg a day is the recommended statin if the person decides to take drug treatment after an informed discussion about benefits and harms, and if there are no contraindications.</li></ul><p><strong>December 2013 </strong>— minor update.

Issued in July 2010.</p><p><strong>April 2010 </strong>— updated to include advice about the QRISK2 and the ASSIGN cardiovascular risk calculators. Advice from SIGN that aspirin is no longer recommended for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes has also been included. Issued in April 2010.</p><p><strong>December 2009 </strong>— minor update. The recommendations on when to consider for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease have been updated.

A reminder from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) that aspirin is not licensed for use in primary prevention of vascular events has been added. Issued in October 2009.</p><p><strong>April 2009 </strong>— updated to include indicators related to primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) of the General Medical Services (GMS) contract in the <em>Goals and outcome measures </em>section. Issued in May 2009.</p><p><strong>January 2009 </strong>— minor typographical correction. Issued in February 2009.</p><p><strong>July to December 2008 </strong>— converted from CKS guidance to CKS topic structure. The evidence-base has been reviewed in detail, and recommendations are more clearly justified and transparently linked to the supporting evidence.</p><p>This topic has been updated to reflect the NICE guideline <em>Lipid modification: cardiovascular risk assessment and the modification of blood lipids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease</em>. Changes to the recommendations on risk assessment include:</p><ul><li>Using a systematic method to prioritize people for formal risk assessment (rather than opportunistic screening).</li><li>Adjusting calculated risk to take into account risk factors not included in risk calculators:<ul><li><strong>Ethnic background. </strong>Previously it was recommended that the calculated risk be multiplied by 1.4 for people originating from the Indian subcontinent. Now it is recommended that the risk be adjusted for men (but not for women).</li><li><strong>Premature cardiovascular disease in a first-degree relative. </strong>Previously it was recommended that the calculated risk be multiplied by 1.3 when there is a family history of premature cardiovascular disease. Now it is recommended that the calculated risk be multiplied by 1.5 when one family member is affected, and by up to 2 when more than one first-degree relative has had premature cardiovascular disease.</li><li><strong>Adiposity. </strong>More emphasis (for routine primary care) is now placed on taking account of severe obesity (body mass index > 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and less emphasis on central obesity and the measurement of waist circumference.</li><li><strong>Comorbidity and treatments. </strong>Some comorbidities (such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic kidney disease) and treatments (e.g. for HIV or with antipsychotics) can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Optimal management of these conditions is now specifically recommended to reduce this risk.</li><li><strong>Age 75 years or older. </strong>It is now recommended that people be regarded as at high risk of cardiovascular disease once they reach the age of 75 years, and that formal risk calculation is not necessary.</li></ul></li><li>Using a risk calculator and not using risk charts to estimate 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease. Previously it was recommended that risk charts or a risk calculator could be used.</li></ul><p>There are no substantive changes to recommendations on lifestyle interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk. There are no substantive changes to recommendations on antiplatelet treatment or antihypertensive treatment. Changes to the recommendations for lipid modification include:</p><ul><li>For primary prevention: to offer to treat with simvastatin 40 mg/day (or a suitable alternative). No targets for treatment are recommended.</li><li>For secondary prevention: to offer to start treatment with simvastatin 40 mg/day (or a suitable alternative). If serum total cholesterol remains above 4 mmol/L or low density lipoprotein cholesterol remains above 2.0 mmol/L, consider increasing to simvastatin 80 mg (or a suitable alternative).</li></ul><p><strong>November 2008 </strong>— minor correction to hyperlinks to the cardiovascular risk charts and calculators provided by the British Hypertension Society.</p><p><strong>April to June 2006 </strong>— reviewed. Validated in September 2006 and issued in October 2006. This guidance has been rewritten following a full literature review and to take account of JBS 2, the second Joint British Societies' guidelines on prevention of cardiovascular disease in clinical practice. The guidance title has changed from <em>Coronary heart disease — identification and management </em>to <em>Cardiovascular risk — assessment and management </em>to reflect the wider aims of current prevention guidelines. Risk assessment is now based on 10-year cardiovascular disease risk using the JBS 2 charts or calculator — previously, risk calculation was based on coronary heart disease risk. Indications for professionally supported lifestyle interventions and drug treatments and suggested targets for treatment have been updated. There is new information about lifestyle interventions and new sections with suggestions on how to help people change to healthier lifestyles, and how to communicate risk and uncertainty.</p><p><strong>October 2005 </strong>— minor update. Reference made to the CKS topic on <em>Antiplatelet treatment</em>, which outlines gastrointestinal issues that need to be considered in the prescribing of low-dose aspirin for the prevention of cardiovascular events. Issued in November 2005.</p><p><strong>September 2004 </strong>— updated to include the circumstances where simvastatin can be purchased over the counter from a pharmacy. Issued in September 2004.</p><p><strong>March 2003 </strong>— written. Validated in June 2003 and issued in July 2003.</p><!-- end field 88b0dffb-2ec9-4dff-ac78-55b1ff2f69f7 --><!-- end item d0bc9e3c-31b9-4cf2-b888-94df3f21ba43 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
