It presents with lesions which can be non-inflammatory (comedones), inflammatory (papules, pustules and nodules) or a mixture of both.</li><li>Up to 95% of adolescents in Western industrialized countries are affected by acne to some extent — 20 to 35% develop moderate or severe acne.</li><li>Complications of acne include skin changes such as scarring, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or depigmentation and psychosocial problems such as depression and anxiety.</li><li>All people with acne should be advised:<ul><li>To avoid over cleaning the skin (which may cause dryness and irritation) — acne is not caused by poor hygiene.</li><li>To use non-comedogenic make-up, cleansers and/or emollients with a pH close to the skin if needed.</li><li>To avoid picking and squeezing spots which may increase the risk of scarring.</li><li>That acne treatments are effective but take time to work — usually up to 8 weeks.</li><li>That acne treatments may irritate the skin, especially at the start of treatment — concentration or application frequency may need to be reduced if skin irritation occurs.</li></ul></li><li>In mild acne where open and closed comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) predominate:<ul><li>A single topical treatment such as a topical retinoid (for example adapalene, if not contraindicated) or benzoyl peroxide should be considered as first-line treatment.</li><li>If both topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide are poorly tolerated, azelaic acid can be considered.</li></ul></li><li>In moderate acne where inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) predominate and response to topical preparations alone is inadequate:<ul><li>Addition of an oral antibiotic such as lymecycline or doxycycline (for a maximum of 3 months) can be considered.<ul><li>A topical retinoid (if not contraindicated) or benzoyl peroxide should always be co-prescribed with oral antibiotics to reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance.</li><li>Macrolide antibiotics (such as erythromycin) should generally be avoided due to high levels of <em>P. acnes</em> resistance but can be used if tetracyclines are contraindicated (for example in pregnancy).</li><li>Non-response to two different courses of antibiotics, or scarring are indications for referral to dermatology for consideration of treatment with isotretinoin.</li></ul></li><li>Combined oral contraceptives (if not contraindicated) in combination with topical agents can be considered as an alternative to systemic antibiotics in women – prescription should be guided by the UK Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use.</li></ul></li><li>Referral to dermatology should be arranged if:<ul><li>A severe variant of acne such as acne conglobata or acne fulminans (immediate referral) is suspected.</li><li>Acne is severe, there is visible scarring or the person is at risk of scarring or significant hyperpigmentation.</li><li>Multiple treatments in primary care have failed.</li><li>Significant psychological distress is associated with acne, regardless of severity.</li><li>There is diagnostic uncertainty.</li></ul></li><li>Follow-up should be arranged 8–12 weeks after initiation of each treatment step:<ul><li>If there has been an adequate response, treatment should be continued for at least 12 weeks.</li><li>If acne has cleared or almost cleared, maintenance therapy with topical retinoids (if not contraindicated) or azelaic acid should be considered.</li><li>If there has not been an adequate response, adherence to treatment, adverse effects and use of comedongenic make up or face creams should be considered before swapping to an alternative product or the next treatment step.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 4d3b87dc-0b1c-4278-9411-aae8edda3246
