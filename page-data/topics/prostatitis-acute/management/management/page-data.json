CKS considers that administration of intravenous antibiotics should take place in secondary care [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/prostatitis-acute/references/\">NICE, 2018a</a>]. </li><li>The NICE guideline development group agreed that if symptoms do not start to improve within 48 hours of taking an antibiotic, people should be referred to hospital because of concerns around complications, such as acute urinary retention or prostatic abscess, and treatment failure because of resistant bacteria [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/prostatitis-acute/references/\">NICE, 2018a</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Urgent referral</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to refer immunocompromised people or people with diabetes is based on expert opinion from a reviewer of this CKS topic.</li><li>The recommendation to refer men with pre-existing urological conditions is pragmatic and based on what CKS considers to be good medical practice.</li></ul><h5>Use of fluoroquinolones</h5><ul><li>NICE recommends that ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin should be use first-line to treat acute prostatitis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/prostatitis-acute/references/\">NICE, 2018a</a>].   <ul><li>The European Medicines Agency's (EMA's) Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee has recommended restricting the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics following a review of disabling and potentially long-lasting side effects mainly involving muscles, tendons, bones and the nervous system [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/prostatitis-acute/references/\">EMA, 2019</a>]. </li><li>The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advises that [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/prostatitis-acute/references/\">MHRA, 2019</a>]:  <ul><li>Systemic (by mouth, injection, or inhalation) fluoroquinolones can very rarely cause long-lasting (up to months or years), disabling, and potentially irreversible side effects, sometimes affecting multiple systems, organ classes, and senses.</li><li>People should be advised to stop treatment at the first signs of a serious adverse reaction, such as tendonitis or tendon rupture, muscle pain, muscle weakness, joint pain, joint swelling, peripheral neuropathy, and central nervous system effects, and to contact their doctor immediately for further advice.</li><li>Fluoroquinolones should not be prescribed:<ul><li>For non-severe or self-limiting infections, or non-bacterial conditions</li><li>For some mild to moderate infections (such as in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) unless other antibiotics that are commonly recommended for these infections are considered inappropriate.</li></ul></li><li>Ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin should no longer be prescribed for uncomplicated cystitis unless other antibiotics that are commonly recommended are considered inappropriate.</li><li>Fluoroquinolones should be avoided in people who have previously had serious adverse reactions with a quinolone or fluoroquinolone antibiotic.</li><li>Fluoroquinolone should be prescribed with special caution for people older than 60 years and for those with renal impairment or solid-organ transplants because they are at a higher risk of tendon injury.</li><li>Fluoroquinolone use should be avoided with a corticosteroid since coadministration could exacerbate fluoroquinolone-induced tendinitis and tendon rupture.</li></ul></li><li>However NICE states that the use of quinolones is appropriate in acute prostatitis as it is a severe infection. </li></ul></li><li>Many antibiotics penetrate the prostate gland poorly, but fluoroquinolones reach therapeutic levels in the prostate [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/prostatitis-acute/references/\">NICE, 2018a</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Oral or parenteral antibiotics</h5><ul><li>NICE recommends that oral antibiotics should be used first line if the person can take oral medicines, and the severity of their condition does not require intravenous antibiotics [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/prostatitis-acute/references/\">NICE, 2018a</a>]. </li><li>The European Association of Urology (EAU) recommends initial treatment with a high dose parenteral antibiotic (such as, a broad-spectrum penicillin, a third-generation cephalosporin or a fluoroquinolone) and possibly combining it with an aminoglycoside, but states that once infection parameters have normalised, oral therapy can be substituted and continued for a total of 2–4 weeks [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/prostatitis-acute/references/\">EAU, 2019</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Use of analgesics</h5><ul><li>The RCGP recommends analgesia for the treatment of acute prostatitis if required [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/prostatitis-acute/references/\">RCGP, 2013</a>] and NICE recommends using paracetamol (with or without a low-dose weak opioid, such as codeine) or ibuprofen [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/prostatitis-acute/references/\">NICE, 2018a</a>]. <ul><li>However, the RCGP and NICE note that the combination of quinolone antibiotics and NSAIDs should be used with caution because there is a risk of interaction, which may increase the risk of seizures.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field
