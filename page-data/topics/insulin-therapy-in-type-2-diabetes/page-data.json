In people with type 2 diabetes, there is a variable combination of increased insulin resistance and progressive loss of pancreatic beta cell function.</li><li>Over time, some people with type 2 diabetes will require insulin therapy as there is insufficient endogenous insulin to maintain adequate blood glucose control.</li><li>Three types of insulin are available in the UK: human insulins, human insulin analogues, and animal insulins (rarely used). Insulins are broadly categorized according to their time-action profiles as:<ul><li>Short-acting insulins — these are used to mimic the physiological secretion of insulin that occurs in response to the glucose absorbed from food and drink.</li><li>Intermediate- and long-acting insulins — these are used to mimic the effect of basal insulin that is secreted continuously throughout the day.</li></ul></li><li>Insulin treatment regimens should be individualized for each person. Options include:</li><ul><li>One, two, or three insulin injections per day regimens.</li><li><div>Multiple daily injection basal-bolus insulin regimens.</div></li></ul><li>The main adverse effect of insulin treatment is hypoglycaemia, which is generally defined as blood glucose levels less than 3.5 mmol/L. The severity of hypoglycaemia is defined by the clinical manifestations, such as:</li><ul><li>Mild — hunger, anxiety or irritability, palpitations, sweating, or tingling lips.</li><li>Moderate — headache, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating, impaired vision, confusion, irritability, agitation, behavioural changes.</li><li>Severe — convulsions, loss of consciousness, and coma. The person is unable to self-manage a hypoglycaemic episode and requires help from another person to achieve normal blood glucose levels.</li></ul><li>Impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia occurs when a person loses the ability to recognize the usual symptoms of hypoglycaemia, or when these symptoms are absent or blunted. </li><li>Education about hypoglycaemia for a person using insulin therapy should include:</li><ul><li>Advice on the emergency management of acute hypoglycaemic episodes.</li><li>Identifying or reviewing possible causes of hypoglycaemia, including impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia.</li><li>Checking that the person and family/carers know how to recognize and manage an episode of hypoglycaemia.</li><li>Reviewing the person's blood glucose control and insulin treatment and considering whether the treatment regimen needs adjusting.</li><li>Giving advice on reducing the risk of further episodes of hypoglycaemia.</li></ul><li>Insulin treatment should only be initiated, titrated, and monitored by healthcare professionals with the relevant expertise and training. Primary healthcare professionals may have a supporting role in providing information on:<ul><li>Insulin administration, storage, injection technique, and injection site problems.</li><li>Blood glucose self-monitoring.</li><li>Lifestyle and cultural aspects of insulin treatment, including diet, exercise, driving, alcohol, holidays and travel, insurance, fasting, and work.</li><li>Managing insulin treatment during periods of intercurrent illness.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field daac8082-65c5-495b-b39b-4fb3cd242437 --><!-- end item 0937a6ee-7462-4324-aefa-3bd81dae818b -->","topic":{"id":"67fc9a6c-6820-57fe-9097-e58e4a920884","topicId":"88119743-0abc-4e8b-8f25-e4fc3f538484","topicName":"Insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes","slug":"insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes","aliases":["Type 2 diabetes -
