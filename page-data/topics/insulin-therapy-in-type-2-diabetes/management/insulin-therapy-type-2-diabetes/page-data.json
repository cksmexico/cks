Examples include Humalog<sup>®</sup> (insulin lispro), Novorapid<sup>®</sup> (insulin aspart), Fiasp<sup>®</sup> (insulin aspart), and Apidra<sup>®</sup> (insulin glulisine). </li></ul></li><li><strong>Intermediate-acting</strong> (isophane or NPH [Neutral Protamine Hagedorn]) insulins — these are used to mimic the effect of the basal insulin that is secreted continuously throughout the day. They have an onset of action of approximately 1–2 hours, maximal effects between 4–12 hours, and a duration of action of 16–35 hours. Examples include Humulin I<sup>®</sup>, Insuman basal<sup>®</sup>, and Human Insulatard<sup>®</sup>. </li><li><strong>Long-acting insulin analogues </strong>— these also mimic basal insulin but can last for a longer period than intermediate-acting insulins. They are normally used once a day and achieve a steady-state level after 2–4 days, to produce a constant level of insulin. Examples include Lantus<sup>®</sup> (insulin glargine U100), Abasaglar<sup>®</sup> (insulin glargine), Semglee<sup>®</sup> (insulin glargine), and Levemir<sup>®</sup> (insulin detemir).</li><li><strong>Ultra-long acting insulin analogues</strong> — once-daily dosing; may be useful when timing of insulin injection is not reliable every 24 hours.
