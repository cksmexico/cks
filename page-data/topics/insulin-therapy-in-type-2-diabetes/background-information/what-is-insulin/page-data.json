This insulin secretion is necessary to control the glucose that is continuously released from the liver, which is relatively constant although it typically declines slightly during the night and peaks before dawn.</li><li>Meal-time bolus insulin — insulin secretion sharply increases in response to glucose absorbed from food and drink. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>In type 2 diabetes, </strong>there is a variable combination of increased insulin resistance (which is associated with increased hepatic glucose production and reduced glucose clearance) and a progressive loss of pancreatic beta cell function (leading to reduced basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion). <ul><li>People with type 2 diabetes can often initially be managed with appropriate lifestyle changes and oral antidiabetic drugs. However, with time, many people will require insulin therapy as there is insufficient endogenous insulin to maintain adequate blood glucose control.</li><li>See the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-2/\">Diabetes - type 2</a> for more information on managing people with type 2 diabetes.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes/references/\">RCN, 2019</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes/references/\">NICE, 2020a</a>]</p><!-- end field 5619b897-8d1d-4b95-a9b3-ebec40903c36 --><!-- end item da9c0ccd-ef91-41c8-b2e4-29a8906b1ae5 -->","topic":{"id":"67fc9a6c-6820-57fe-9097-e58e4a920884","topicId":"88119743-0abc-4e8b-8f25-e4fc3f538484","topicName":"Insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes","slug":"insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes","lastRevised":"Last revised in January 2021","chapters":[{"id":"4f9882ba-20c0-5e9e-bb3a-2155b58e9fa3","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"389303c3-3ee2-5555-ae0c-a591f93d77cc","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"514165fe-0c20-5522-a4e0-11c24b147228","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"bc06b7e7-e2fe-54d4-88af-3eb1d924ea47","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"ef37d0a0-9664-5b62-b330-ad962b4b3a68","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"a5f3d9b7-224a-5eea-989b-9a0cbacf5225","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"f2bce4cb-bcce-5ce9-996d-2ced6ac3a50a","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"6455faf7-803e-54c2-8dd1-2cbbd74a5d85","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"cf13482a-90e2-55e5-9af9-b7d5293d52ac","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"3d065be5-2b02-510f-9371-5b67f3ccc4a3","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"bd7fd90b-c79f-59b8-9faf-deb57545cee3","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP - Options for local implementation"},{"id":"d6ece006-e4c1-51be-bb8b-c25c0677c4ca","slug":"nice-quality-standards","fullItemName":"NICE quality standards"}]},{"id":"43e27bd2-a6b7-552a-b13d-c83d6f3d0236","fullItemName":"Background information","slug":"background-information","subChapters":[{"id":"578c4a95-b0c0-57ab-9331-874d0bc55f06","slug":"what-is-insulin","fullItemName":"What is insulin?"}]},{"id":"8cb52e25-e560-555c-9e28-b8aa54455a25","fullItemName":"Management","slug":"management","subChapters":[{"id":"e1e64ce2-2b3e-5b6c-81d3-e0bb4541d132","slug":"insulin-therapy-type-2-diabetes","fullItemName":"Scenario: Insulin therapy - type 2 diabetes"}]},{"id":"52a8abf6-b1aa-55a4-b678-dec7383f5683","fullItemName":"Supporting evidence","slug":"supporting-evidence","subChapters":[]},{"id":"0589e653-130e-5d79-9918-c4d6981bca94","fullItemName":"How this topic was developed","slug":"how-this-topic-was-developed","subChapters":[{"id":"0274003c-a029-5e95-add6-16cb7afbee51","slug":"search-strategy","fullItemName":"Search strategy"},{"id":"43dcfc3e-f5f4-5f31-b9cf-8af2f3f255be","slug":"stakeholder-engagement","fullItemName":"Stakeholder engagement"},{"id":"8ace3fa1-6c91-5ca6-b45a-a561f03342a4","slug":"evidence-exclusion-criteria","fullItemName":"Evidence exclusion criteria"},{"id":"1a572d4a-4179-5fbe-8d18-4a37c55e2078","slug":"organizational-behavioural-financial-barriers","fullItemName":"Organizational, behavioural and financial barriers"},{"id":"ed27f179-49b6-5ae8-a5bf-c2d6fdc0cb4c","slug":"declarations-of-interest","fullItemName":"Declarations of interest"}]},{"id":"11154307-c719-57fb-8971-db931a520f7c","fullItemName":"References","slug":"references","subChapters":[]}]},"parentChapter":{"id":"43e27bd2-a6b7-552a-b13d-c83d6f3d0236","slug":"background-information","fullItemName":"Background information"},"subChapters":[]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
