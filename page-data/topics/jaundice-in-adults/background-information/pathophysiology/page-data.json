Its metabolism occurs in three phases â€” pre-hepatic, intra-hepatic, and post-hepatic.</li><li>The causes of jaundice can be broadly classified by the stages of bilirubin metabolism, although there may be some overlap between categories. Dysfunction at any of these three phases can lead to jaundice:<ul><li><strong>Pre-hepatic:</strong> haem molecules are degraded in macrophages via biliverdin to bilirubin. This occurs mainly in the spleen and liver but also in other tissues such as the skin and kidneys. On release from macrophages, bilirubin is bound to plasma albumin and transported to the liver for conjugation and excretion. Unconjugated bilirubin is insoluble in water.</li><li><strong>Intra-hepatic:</strong> once in the liver, unconjugated bilirubin is selectively removed from the blood by hepatocytes. It is then conjugated in the hepatocytes with glucuronic acid, becomes water soluble, and can be excreted in bile.</li><li><strong>Post-hepatic:</strong> soluble bilirubin is transported through the liver and cystic ducts in bile and then stored in the gallbladder or passes into the duodenum. In the intestine, some bilirubin is excreted in the stool and the rest is metabolized by gut flora into urobilinogen and reabsorbed and excreted by the kidneys.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-adults/references/\">Roche, 2004</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-adults/references/\">Warrell, 2010</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-adults/references/\">Fargo, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/jaundice-in-adults/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2019</a>]</p><!-- end field ce0197ed-e925-4538-b337-3844c8fde08d --><!-- end item a1fecb03-65cc-4465-aae1-9129dd6dee9a -->","topic":{"id":"517d5301-7d5a-50be-aa9f-5b5f2e5a1ac2","topicId":"2f2490fa-8fe7-4e82-937d-16d0c246af28","topicName":"Jaundice in adults","slug":"jaundice-in-adults","lastRevised":"Last revised in November 2020","chapters":[{"id":"a41fa4d5-aaf9-558f-a200-a15d9ae24b73","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"4b100f17-858f-5860-b737-8358b8ad4e40","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"b3211749-3c3a-5d89-863c-5c9a8bac1051","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"7086a372-81e6-56a3-ab69-cae90c352870","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"75696af8-b6b9-5e35-8d4b-bb9797a7e30e","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"1f3fdaa2-4042-53bd-bfa1-b9b817765712","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"5dc38689-6ca3-5f08-b82e-a0901a0eb94d","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"fbabc528-91c0-58ad-85e9-34373cbf2649","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"a478864c-049f-5a95-912c-da77a6409724","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"aaa0268c-73ff-5ed6-8f75-90eb116dbf89","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"e58dfa37-a954-5f41-bcf3-cd2264253789","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP - Options for local implementation"},{"id":"b1891943-d6c0-5f2f-9a9f-f3204be1ac47","slug":"nice-quality-standards","fullItemName":"NICE quality standards"}]},{"id":"08826cc0-037c-5bac-b439-8f79488aed70","fullItemName":"Background information","slug":"background-information","subChapters":[{"id":"e132a2db-c13f-58ac-9020-f17d9bc809e7","slug":"definition","fullItemName":"Definition"},{"id":"de318bf6-2016-5a90-939b-19f1d22a779c","slug":"pathophysiology","fullItemName":"Pathophysiology"},{"id":"96c3c504-5932-5b65-83dc-1c20c7848e0a","slug":"causes","fullItemName":"Causes"},{"id":"d76d70a4-a469-5749-a699-59521eb1ead1","slug":"prevalence","fullItemName":"Prevalence"},{"id":"f47fa662-051d-5307-ada7-99b2ada242f4","slug":"risk-factors","fullItemName":"Risk factors"}]},{"id":"7cabc727-d00f-55b2-8a6f-4707af4d7157","fullItemName":"Diagnosis","slug":"diagnosis","subChapters":[{"id":"7838d032-4715-595c-9029-f183e606749b","slug":"assessing-a-person-with-jaundice","fullItemName":"Assessing a person with jaundice"}]},{"id":"48e2dd52-27f9-5631-b987-589ad6f71ae3","fullItemName":"Management","slug":"management","subChapters":[{"id":"f08a38f4-c513-5356-8b70-7562aa88ee0c","slug":"management-of-jaundice-in-adults","fullItemName":"Scenario: Management of jaundice in adults"}]},{"id":"57dfb6aa-c306-5c03-afe4-c2bdd0a93684","fullItemName":"Supporting evidence","slug":"supporting-evidence","subChapters":[]},{"id":"a665f23d-c451-5c74-9056-8fbd50b70927","fullItemName":"How this topic was developed","slug":"how-this-topic-was-developed","subChapters":[{"id":"434744ca-a9a5-5aa1-b361-377e83f269ad","slug":"search-strategy","fullItemName":"Search strategy"},{"id":"ada4134b-bf53-5890-bb39-37e20d7c8c07","slug":"stakeholder-engagement","fullItemName":"Stakeholder engagement"},{"id":"79937cb7-9330-5001-82f6-a0d844ee98d0","slug":"evidence-exclusion-criteria","fullItemName":"Evidence exclusion criteria"},{"id":"730388da-4c3c-55cc-93ad-00439e2a8ee7","slug":"organizational-behavioural-financial-barriers","fullItemName":"Organizational, behavioural and financial barriers"},{"id":"02a6ff74-c849-5cdf-afc5-046d03ab99d1","slug":"declarations-of-interest","fullItemName":"Declarations of interest"}]},{"id":"94689803-b200-5797-a77d-6915ede2f3b1","fullItemName":"References","slug":"references","subChapters":[]}]},"parentChapter":{"id":"08826cc0-037c-5bac-b439-8f79488aed70","slug":"background-information","fullItemName":"Background information"},"subChapters":[]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
