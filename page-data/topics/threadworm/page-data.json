Transparent tape is applied to the perianal area first thing in the morning and then examined under a microscope to detect threadworm eggs. Stool examination is not generally recommended.</li><li>Other causes of perineal and vulval itch include dermatitis, candidal infection, pubic lice and haemorrhoids. Threadworms are rarely confused with other types of worm infestation because of their specific appearance.</li><li>Treatment is recommended if threadworms have been seen or eggs detected. Treatment of all household members at the same time (unless contraindicated) should be considered.<ul><li>For adults and children aged over 6 months, an anthelmintic (mebendazole) combined with hygiene measures is recommended — mebendazole is not licensed for children under the age of 2 years.</li><li>For children aged 6 months and under, hygiene measures alone for 6 weeks, are recommended.</li><li>For pregnant or breastfeeding women, the recommended treatment is hygiene measures for 6 weeks. Treatment with mebendazole is contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy and the manufacturer recommends avoidance throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding.</li></ul></li><li>If infestation recurs this is usually due to re-infection and not failure of anti-helmintic therapy:<ul><li>Other causes of symptoms should be considered.</li><li>If the diagnosis is certain, re-treatment of the person and household contacts with mebendazole is recommended (unless contraindicated).</li><li>The importance of strict hygiene measures should be reinforced.</li></ul></li><li>If the person has frequent recurrences advice should be sought from a paediatrician or consultant in infectious diseases.</li></ul><!-- end field 317536cc-e9fc-43bf-970b-773a46b700f0 --><!-- end item c381de49-562f-4aac-bf13-492b272daa89 -->","topic":{"id":"8a97bd49-4ad3-515f-8923-f0ec848cf24c","topicId":"b0b44433-e7d8-4b41-a7d4-b50a0ad1824c","topicName":"Threadworm","slug":"threadworm","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"da49fd42-7ee5-55e8-8659-b4baaae0cf2c","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"baa83e7c-4453-5e2d-8185-58293d01d21a","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"470c1fa9-f2b5-5834-9da5-33d75a17a175","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"d0c95636-9d10-509d-b204-7756ac689104","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"b8a27983-2273-5cb5-aba2-55b199b13cc8","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"8db90159-3209-513e-9767-df26030de0f6","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"f9740617-b8ee-5dbe-b867-6dbf38f3d330","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"4625685d-dd18-552d-bcfb-921467f26f70","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"d410e87b-61e5-5596-9db1-c9fb2c173767","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"e23cb012-fd31-5db3-a82b-9a1895d766a6","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"5bc4fd76-d5b6-59d9-b3be-c965421664ce","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
