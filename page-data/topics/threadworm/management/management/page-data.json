The limited data available are from relatively old, small studies comparing mebendazole with either placebo or with drugs that are not available in the UK.</li><li>The British National Formulary [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/threadworm/references/\">BNF 74, 2017</a>] states that mebendazole is the drug of choice for treating threadworm infection in patients of all ages over 6 months.</li><li>There are few contraindications to the use of mebendazole, and the manufacturer reports that safety has been evaluated in 6276 subjects participating in 39 clinical trials for the treatment of single or mixed parasitic infestations of the gastrointestinal tract. In these 39 clinical trials, no adverse drug reactions (ADRs) occurred in ≥1% of treated subjects [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/threadworm/references/\">ABPI, 2016a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/threadworm/references/\">ABPI, 2016b</a>].</li></ul><h5>Repeat dose after 2 weeks</h5><ul><li>There is some debate in the medical literature regarding whether a second dose of mebendazole should routinely be given 14 days after the initial dose. In line with the current Summary of Product Characteristics, CKS recommends that the dose is repeated if infection persists [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/threadworm/references/\">ABPI, 2016a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/threadworm/references/\">ABPI, 2016b</a>].</li></ul><h5>Treat all family members</h5><ul><li>The BNF [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/threadworm/references/\">BNF 74, 2017</a>] recommends that all members of the family require treatment.</li><li>The summary of product characteristics strongly recommends that all members of the family are treated at the same time [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/threadworm/references/\">ABPI, 2016a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/threadworm/references/\">ABPI, 2016b</a>].</li></ul><h5>Treatment of threadworm in pregnancy and breastfeeding</h5><ul><li>Hygiene measures alone are preferred for treatment of threadworm in breastfeeding and pregnancy — the manufacturers recommend avoidance of mebendazole [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/threadworm/references/\">ABPI, 2016a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/threadworm/references/\">ABPI, 2016b</a>].</li><li>The UK Teratology Information Service [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/threadworm/references/\">UKTIS, 2014</a>] states that mebendazole may be considered after first attempting rigorous hygiene measures but treatment should ideally be delayed until after the first trimester (treatment in any trimester is off-label). Each case requires a specific risk assessment including consideration of other risk factors which may independently increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome.</li></ul><h5>Treatment of threadworm in young children</h5><ul><li>The British National Formulary recommends mebendazole for treating threadworm infection in children over 6 months; however, it is not licensed for use in children less than 2 years of age [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/threadworm/references/\">ABPI, 2016a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/threadworm/references/\">ABPI, 2016b</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/threadworm/references/\">BNF 74, 2017</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in the British Medical Journal Best Practice series recommends consultation with an infectious-disease specialist before treating young children with antihelminthics as these drugs have not been studied extensively in children under the age of 2 years [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/threadworm/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2017</a>].</li></ul><h5>Hygiene measures</h5><ul><li>Expert opinion varies regarding how long personal hygiene measures should continue. As a pragmatic approach, CKS suggests that personal hygiene measures should be continued for:<ul><li>Two weeks in people who have taken an anthelmintic (as eggs can remain viable in the environment for up to 2 weeks).</li><li>Six weeks in people who are using hygiene measures alone (the approximate lifespan of an adult threadworm).</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 43ee5ef2-556c-4684-856f-189714236368 --><!-- end item ac19c931-ddb9-41da-aecb-bb875975033f -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
