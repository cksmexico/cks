If pregnancy does occur with an intrauterine method in situ, the risk of an ectopic pregnancy occurring is increased; in some studies, half of the pregnancies that occurred were ectopic. The overall risk of ectopic pregnancy is reduced with the use of IUC when compared with using no contraception because IUCs are very effective methods of contraception overall.</li><li><strong>Ovarian cysts </strong>— some women (1–10%) develop functional ovarian cysts; however, these do not usually need to be treated as they tend to be asymptomatic and resolve spontaneously. </li><li><strong>Hormonal adverse effects </strong>— systemic absorption of progestogen occurs with the LNG-IUS. Hormonal adverse effects, such as acne, breast tenderness, and headache, may occur, but they usually settle with time.</li><li style=\"box-sizing: inherit;\"><strong>Unscheduled bleeding</strong> — irregular, prolonged, or frequent bleeding may occur in the 3–6 months following IUC insertion, but menstrual bleeding patterns tend to improve with time.
