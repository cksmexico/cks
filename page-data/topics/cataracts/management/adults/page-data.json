This proliferative opaque membrane causes decreased visual acuity, blurred vision, or glare. It occurs gradually months or years after surgery. It can be corrected by laser treatment.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Other complications include:</strong><ul><li><strong>Posterior capsule rupture and/or vitreous loss </strong>— this is the most common intraoperative complication. This occurs in 1.9–2% of cases. Consequences of posterior capsule rupture include: retained lens fragments in the anterior chamber or vitreous; cystoid macular oedema; vitreus prolapse or traction; retinal detachment; endophthalmitis; elevated intraocular pressure, intraocular inflammation or haemorrhage; corneal oedema; and intraocular lens dislocation. </li><li><strong>Corneal decompensation</strong> — due to corneal oedema. This is a risk when lens fragments are retained in the anterior chamber. </li><li><strong>Cystoid macular oedema</strong> — inflammatory fluid in the centre of the retina. This usually responds well to topical anti-inflammatories, but can be severe and require prolonged treatment and lead to permanent impairment.</li><li><strong>Detached retina</strong> — may occur weeks or months after surgery. More likely to occur if vitreous loss has occurred, or in eyes with severe shortsightedness (may lead to loss of the eye). There is an increased risk with posterior capsule rupture. </li><li><strong>Dislocation of the implant lens</strong>.</li><li><strong>Dropped nucleus</strong> — part or all of the lens fragment falls through a posterior capsule rupture into the posterior segment of the eye. </li><li><strong>Endophthalmitis</strong> — this is an ophthalmic emergency that can lead to vision loss. The person usually presents with a reduction in vision and a red painful eye. The rate of infection is less than 1 in 1000 after cataract surgery where intracameral cefuroxime is used routinely. </li><li><strong>Floppy iris syndrome </strong>— this is associated with use of alpha-blockers (for example, tamsulosin).</li><li><strong>Raised intraocular pressure</strong> — transient elevation may occur in the postoperative period. </li><li><strong>Refractive surprise</strong> — unexpectedly large (or different from expected) need for glasses. This may occur as a result of an unsuitable intraocular lens (IOL) being implanted or due to positioning of the IOL. </li><li><strong>Suprachoroidal haemorrhage</strong> (very rare) — bleeding inside the eye can lead to sight-threatening complications. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field d3a59a99-cd61-48f6-abff-4f4d9063ddf7 --><!-- end item cc71a675-12c4-4045-a99b-198ff0586909 -->","subChapters":[{"id":"b4693321-0261-5eb5-8ebd-6dab51e43dc4","slug":"basis-for-recommendation-01d","fullItemName":"Basis for recommendation","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 0aa9ed69-175b-4f0c-b878-b6810dddcd0a --><h4>Basis for recommendation</h4><!-- end field 0aa9ed69-175b-4f0c-b878-b6810dddcd0a -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 01d6c3c2-29e8-43e3-8271-5a3518af0ca8 --><!-- begin field 56c5e4e9-b943-4fc2-86a7-7c512003a050 --><p>This information is based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline <em>Cataracts in adults: management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cataracts/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>], the American Association of Ophthalmology (AAO) guideline <em>Cataract in the adult eye preferred practice pattern </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cataracts/references/\">AAO, 2016a</a>], the British Medical Journal (BMJ) best practice guide <em>Cataracts</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cataracts/references/\">BMJ, 2018</a>], the Royal College of Ophthalmology (RCO) commissioning guide <em>Adult cataract surgery </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cataracts/references/\">RCO, 2018</a>], the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) publication <em>Assessing fitness to drive – a guide for medical professionals </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cataracts/references/\">DVLA, 2018</a>], and expert opinion in a narrative review <em>Cataracts </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cataracts/references/\">Liu, 2017</a>].  </p><!-- end field 56c5e4e9-b943-4fc2-86a7-7c512003a050 --><!-- end item 01d6c3c2-29e8-43e3-8271-5a3518af0ca8 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
