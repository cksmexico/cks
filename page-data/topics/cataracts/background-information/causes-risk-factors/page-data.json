A gradual accumulation of yellow–brown pigment develops in the lens of the eye as a result of ageing. Most cataracts occur in people aged over 60 years.</li><li><strong>Eye disease</strong> — secondary cataract<strong> </strong>may develop as a complication of another eye disease, including chronic anterior uveitis, acute congestive angle-closure glaucoma, high myopia, and some hereditary fundus dystrophies, such as retinitis pigmentosa, Leber congenital amaurosis, gyrate atrophy, and Stickler syndrome.</li><li><strong>Trauma </strong>— cataract<strong> </strong>may develop after a blunt or penetrating injury to an eye, an electric shock, exposure to radiation, and as a complication of some surgical eye operations. Trauma is the most common cause of unilateral cataract in young people.</li><li><strong>Systemic disease:</strong><ul><li>Diabetes mellitus — compared with the general population there is about a 2-fold increased prevalence of cataract in people with diabetes mellitus. The risk is highest at younger ages, in people with macular oedema, and in people with long-standing diabetes [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cataracts/references/\">Becker, 2018</a>].   </li><li>Myotonic dystrophy — about 90% of people with myotonic dystrophy develop cataracts by the age of 50 years.</li><li>Neurofibromatosis type 2 — is associated with early development of cataract in 60% of people, often in early adulthood.</li><li>Atopic dermatitis — about 10% of people with severe atopic dermatitis develop cataracts in their second to fourth decade. The risk is thought to be independent of the risk of developing cataracts associated with the use of corticosteroid treatment for the dermatitis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cataracts/references/\">Bair et al, 2011</a>].</li></ul></li><li><strong>Congenital and developmental cataracts in children:</strong><ul><li>Unilateral cataracts — are usually idiopathic. Most of them are non-hereditary, without any systemic associations, and the child is usually otherwise well. </li><li>Bilateral cataracts — many are idiopathic but a cause is identified in about 40% of affected children. Causes include: <ul><li>Hereditary cataracts that are often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern but sometimes in an autosomal recessive, or X-linked fashion.</li><li>Intrauterine infections, such as rubella, varicella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, and toxoplasmosis.</li><li>Genetic syndromes, such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21), Edward's syndrome (trisomy 18), and Marfan syndrome.</li><li>Metabolic conditions, such as galactosaemia, Lowe syndrome, mannosidosis, Wilson's disease.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Other risk factors </strong>associated with the development of cataracts include:<ul><li>Corticosteroid treatment (topical, oral, and inhaled) — particularly in people taking high doses or for long periods of time.</li><li>Cumulative lifetime exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) light — efforts to protect against UVB (such as wearing brimmed hats and UVB blocking sunglasses) are reasonable precautions that may help to prevent cataracts.</li><li>Ethnicity — people of Asian ethnic origin have a higher prevalence than European people, and white people have a higher prevalence than Afro-Caribbean people. </li><li>Family history.</li><li>Female gender. </li><li>Hypertension.</li><li>Low educational or socioeconomic status.</li><li>Tobacco smoking — there is a dose-dependent association between smoking and the incidence and progression of cataracts. Smokers who quit smoking reduce their risk of developing cataracts compared with those who continue to smoke.</li></ul></li><li><strong>In the developing world</strong>, malnutrition, acute dehydration, and exposure to excessive UVB light are important risk factors.</li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cataracts/references/\">Allen and Vasavada, 2006</a>;
