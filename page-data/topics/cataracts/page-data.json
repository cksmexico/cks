A cataract may form in one or both eyes, at any age.</li><li>Most cataracts occur as a result of ageing and are most common in people aged over 60 years.</li><li>Other causes of cataracts include:<ul><li>Trauma — as a result of injury or an eye operation.</li><li>Eye disease — such as chronic anterior uveitis, acute congestive angle-closure glaucoma, high myopia, retinitis pigmentosa, Leber congenital amaurosis, gyrate atrophy, and Stickler syndrome.</li><li>Systemic disease — such as diabetes mellitus, myotonic dystrophy, neurofibromatosis type 2, and severe atopic dermatitis.</li><li>Congenital and developmental cataracts in children.</li></ul></li><li>Risk factors associated with the development of cataracts include: a family history of age-related cataracts, corticosteroid treatment, smoking, and prolonged exposure to ultraviolet B light.</li><li>Untreated, most people with a cataract will become severely visually impaired. With surgery, 95% of people will have 6/12 best-corrected vision if there is no other pre-existing ocular copathology.</li><li>Untreated congenital cataracts in babies cause deprivation amblyopia, leading to serious lifelong visual impairment, even if the cataracts are removed when older. Even after successful surgery at an optimum time (within the first few weeks of life), eventual visual outcome is very variable and difficult to predict.</li><li>The main symptom of cataracts in adults is a gradual and painless reduction in visual acuity. This may manifest as gradual difficulty in reading, recognizing faces, or watching television.<ul><li>Glare (difficulty seeing in the presence of bright light) may be the dominant symptom at first and manifest as difficulty seeing in bright sunshine, or difficulty driving at night when oncoming vehicles have bright headlights.</li></ul></li><li>Symptoms and signs of cataracts in babies and children include:<ul><li>Poor vision — parents or carers may suspect this.</li><li>A white or grey pupil (leukocoria).</li><li>Involuntary eye movements (nystagmus).</li><li>Squint (strabismus).</li><li>Sensitivity to light or problems with glare.</li></ul></li><li>On examination, visual acuity will usually be reduced. With an ophthalmoscope, an opacity can be seen in the lens (this can range from a small dot to complete opacification), and there is a reduced or obliterated red reflex. </li><li>An adult with a cataract should be encouraged to have an eye examination by an optometrist to:<ul><li>Accurately assess visual acuity (with and without corrective contact lenses and glasses).</li><li>Exclude other causes of visual impairment.</li></ul></li><li>Referral for cataract surgery should be based on a discussion with the person including: <ul><li>How the cataract affects their vision and quality of life.</li><li>Whether one or both eyes are affected.</li><li>What surgery involves, including the risks and benefits. </li><li>How their quality of life may be affected if they choose not to have surgery. </li><li>Whether they want to have surgery. </li></ul></li><li>For babies and children with suspected cataract — urgent referral to an ophthalmologist should be arranged.</li></ul><!-- end field 8ebab726-e4f9-439b-8069-15ff5ca9b2c1 --><!-- end item b93a48f9-3308-445e-8171-4960294f01a4 -->","topic":{"id":"eeb34712-def5-5b38-9125-fec8925c1bcc","topicId":"9a3fe0f5-1b06-4ff6-9a79-2ed4a8f4b2c5","topicName":"Cataracts","slug":"cataracts","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"90f4d5e6-8dee-54a2-b535-a3280c9ff7e9","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"da1f4019-d02d-523b-80ce-e4ba8579b43d","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"87a3b79a-dbff-50b1-a10c-fc54f60080f3","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"cd79c0cf-e5a8-5fb6-99af-3d9e0eaf4b28","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"d0c360ad-3631-54ab-809e-570769cd5aa1","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"8af6938b-ae1b-5c2a-8b8c-826edbed8669","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"9ed0ddb2-07a6-5c9e-86b8-740894cd88e7","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"d3db836f-68b9-5c32-bb04-1d6c9b755015","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"78ff1c73-3038-544d-829b-9c4fa6e07ea0","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"656fb8f7-2abd-5f0f-ad42-29abf4c1f6f6","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"b62da534-cf57-5fe0-b8ab-b615d0f453db","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
