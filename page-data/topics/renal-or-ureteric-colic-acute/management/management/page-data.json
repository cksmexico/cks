NSAIDs also reduced pain, had fewer adverse effects, and had a better balance of benefits and costs.</li><li>The committee discussed the route of administration for NSAIDs and noted that most studies used IV or intramuscular (IM) NSAIDs. However, oral or rectal NSAIDs are more commonly used in UK practice. Although there was very little evidence that oral or rectal NSAIDs were as effective as IV or IM NSAIDs, the commitee were reluctant to recommend a significant change in practice that would have resource implications. Therefore, they were not able to specify a particular route of administration of NSAIDs but agreed to make a research recommendation on route of administration to inform future practice.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Paracetamol</strong><ul><li>NICE recommends IV paracetamol if NSAIDs are contraindicated or ineffective, based on evidence that showed a benefit of paracetamol for pain relief when compared with opioids.</li><li>The committee noted that most of the evidence was for IV paracetamol, which differs from other routes of administration in terms of potency and speed of action. They agreed this benefit could not be generalized to other routes of administration, such as oral. This difference in mechanism of action was not believed to be as strong for other drugs, such as NSAIDs.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Opioids</strong><ul><li>NICE found no benefit of opioids for pain relief over NSAIDs or paracetamol. However, opioids showed a benefit compared with antispasmodics in terms of pain relief, and there was no difference between opioids and most comparators in terms of adverse events.</li><li>The committee noted concerns around opioid use in terms of dependency and misuse, and agreed that they could only be considered if both NSAIDs and IV paracetamol were contraindicated or ineffective.</li><li>CKS is aware that there may be cases where IV paracetamol is not readily available and has extrapolated this recommendation to those cases.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Antispasmodics</strong><ul><li>Antispasmodics offered no benefit in terms of pain relief when compared with NSAIDs.

Limited evidence from a single study in adults showed a benefit of lemon juice in terms of urine calcium and pH but no difference in urine oxalate.</li><li>Lemon juice is high in citrate, leading to higher concentrations of citrate in urine. This may stop calcium from binding to other stone constituents and so prevent stone formation and recurrence. The NICE guideline committee agreed to recommend a high water intake and the addition of lemon juice to water.</li><li>Evidence identified by NICE showed a benefit of avoiding carbonated drinks in terms of stone recurrence; therefore, the committee agreed to recommend that these should be avoided.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Low salt and normal calcum intake</strong><ul><li>Evidence on diet was mixed, but the NICE guideline committee agreed that a normal calcium intake and a low salt intake may help to prevent stone recurrence.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Avoiding a high protein diet</strong><ul><li>Evidence on avoiding a high protein diet was inconclusive, but the NICE guideline committee acknowledged that this is the advice currently given.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Offering written information</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><h5>Potassium citrate </h5><ul><li>NICE found evidence that potassium citrate could reduce the recurrence of calcium oxalate and calcium oxalate/calcium phosphate stones in adults. However, there were adverse events associated with its use, and the committee agreed that there may be concerns about hyperkalaemia in some groups. Despite this, the committee agreed that the benefits in terms of stones avoided are likely to outweigh any harms. Potassium citrate is currently used in UK practice, so the committee agreed it could be considered to prevent stone recurrence in adults with calcium oxalate stones.</li><li>Limited evidence in children showed that potassium citrate reduced stone recurrence after <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/renal-or-ureteric-colic-acute/management/management/#diagnostic-imaging-management\">percutaneous nephrolithotomy and shockwave lithotripsy</a>. There was no information on adverse events or on the type of stone or results of urine testing. The committee noted that in UK practice, potassium citrate is used for children based on the levels of calcium or citrate in urine, and agreed that it could be considered for children with recurrence of calcium oxalate stones and with hypercalciuria or hypocitraturia.</li></ul><h5>Thiazides </h5><ul><li>Limited evidence showed that thiazides reduced stone recurrence in adults with hypercalciuria compared with no intervention. There was no benefit for adults with normal levels of urinary calcium, and evidence was mixed when the biochemical abnormality was mixed or not defined. The NICE guideline committee agreed that thiazides tend to be well tolerated but should only be used after salt has been restricted. They agreed that thiazides could be considered for adults with hypercalciuria and recurrent calcium oxalate stones, but only after reducing salt intake to recommended levels.</li></ul><h5>Treatments <em>not</em> recommended</h5><ul><li>Allopurinol — there was insufficient evidence for the NICE guideline committee to make recommendations on allopurinol or combined therapy of allopurinol and thiazides.</li><li>Magnesium — although limited evidence suggested a potential benefit of magnesium, the committee knew from their experience that magnesium may cause adverse effects. The committee agreed that the limited evidence and potential for adverse events did not justify a recommendation.</li></ul><!-- end field 46f284db-5047-4c1c-89b3-ef1b3056ce50 --><!-- end item 307bb319-4750-44e6-9737-318fae4fd5c5 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
