Pain is often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and haematuria.</li><li>Identifying risk factors, such as chronic dehydration, family history, gastrointestinal conditions (such as Crohn's disease), and the use of certain medications (such as protease inhibitors). </li><li>Performing an abdominal examination to help exclude differential diagnoses, such as appendicitis and diverticulitis.</li><li>Assessing for signs of complication, such as hesitancy of micturition or an intermittent urinary stream (suggesting urinary tract obstruction) and fever and sweats (suggesting coexisting urinary tract infection).</li></ul></li><li>Immediate hospital admission should be arranged if:<ul><li>The person is in shock or has signs of systemic infection (such as fever and sweats).</li><li>The person is at increased risk of acute kidney injury, for example, if they have pre-existing chronic kidney disease or a solitary or transplanted kidney, or if bilateral obstructing stones are suspected.</li><li>The person is dehydrated and cannot take oral fluids due to nausea and/or vomiting.</li><li>There is uncertainty about the diagnosis.</li></ul></li><li>For all other people with suspected renal or ureteric colic:<ul><li>Urgent (within 24 hours of presentation) imaging should be offered (low-dose non-contrast CT for most adults; ultrasound for pregnant women, children, and young people). </li><li>A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) by any route should be offered for pain relief. If NSAIDs are contraindicated or ineffective, intravenous (IV) paracetamol should be offered. If both NSAIDs and IV paracetamol are contraindicated or ineffective, or IV paracetamol is unavailable, an opioid analgesic should be considered.</li></ul></li><li>Management of urinary stones depends on factors such as the size of the stone, severity of symptoms, location of the stone (renal or ureteric), and the age of the person. Options include watchful waiting, medical expulsive therapy, and surgical treatment.</li><li>To reduce the risk of recurrence:<ul><li>Appropriate dietary and lifestyle advice should be given, including increasing fluid intake, adding fresh lemon juice to drinking water, avoiding carbonated drinks, reducing salt intake, maintaining a normal dietary calcium intake, eating a balanced diet, and maintaining a healthy weight.</li><li>Potassium citrate should be considered for<strong> </strong>adults with a recurrence of stones that are predominantly (more than 50%) calcium oxalate and for children and young people with a recurrence of stones that are predominantly (more than 50%) calcium oxalate, and with hypercalciuria or hypocitraturia.</li><li>Thiazide treatment should be considered for adults with a recurrence of stones that are predominantly (more than 50%) calcium oxalate and hypercalciuria, after restricting their sodium intake to no more than 6 g a day.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field e65120b9-1f0f-47e3-850b-aa296580460d --><!-- end item d1f55a72-d015-4772-880a-5d2f7b2bdbb9 -->","topic":{"id":"cdafd21d-4810-57d3-8f62-82a1a19fdfca","topicId":"a218f6a4-ed45-4224-aff1-78febfb7ee5e","topicName":"Renal or ureteric colic -
