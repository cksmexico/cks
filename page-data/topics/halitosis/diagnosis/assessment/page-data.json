in the international consensus document [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/halitosis/references/\">Seemann et al, 2014</a>] and in review articles [<a

in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/halitosis/references/\">Porter and Scully, 2006</a>].</li><li>The information that it may be difficult for a person with halitosis to accurately assess the severity of their own oral odour is based on expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/halitosis/references/\">Eli et al, 2001</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/halitosis/references/\">Porter and Scully, 2006</a>].</li><li>The

to diagnose halitosis and evaluate its severity is recommended as the gold standard clinical test. It is quick, simple, cheap, and no specific clinical training is needed [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/halitosis/references/\">Porter and Scully, 2006</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/halitosis/references/\">Bollen and Beikler, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/halitosis/references/\">Scully and Greenman, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/halitosis/references/\">Seemann et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/halitosis/references/\">Singh, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/halitosis/references/\">Kapoor, 2016</a>].
