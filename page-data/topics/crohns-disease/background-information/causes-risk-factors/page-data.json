A genetic component has also been suggested by large concordance studies in twins in northern Europe [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/crohns-disease/references/\">Baumgart, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/crohns-disease/references/\">Kalla, 2014</a>].</li><li>Smoking — the risk of Crohn's disease is increased in smokers (in contrast to ulcerative colitis, where the risk is decreased). A meta-analysis found the odds ratio for the risk of Crohn's disease in smokers compared with non-smokers to be 1.76 [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/crohns-disease/references/\">Mahid et al, 2006</a>]. In addition, smoking may increase the risk of disease relapse [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/crohns-disease/references/\">Kalla, 2014</a>] and need for surgical resection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/crohns-disease/references/\">Mowat et al, 2011</a>].</li><li>Infectious gastroenteritis — the risk of Crohn's disease is increased four-fold following an episode of infectious gastroenteritis, particularly in the following year; however, the absolute risk is low [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/crohns-disease/references/\">Gomollon, 2017</a>].</li><li>Appendicectomy — the risk of Crohn's disease increases early after an appendicectomy and decreases to that of the general population after about 5 years post-operatively. A meta-analysis found that the relative risk of Crohn's disease within a year post-appendicectomy was 6.7, and after 5 years, the relative risk was 1.1 [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/crohns-disease/references/\">Kaplan et al, 2008</a>]. Subsequent research, however, has found conflicting evidence for this association, which may be related to diagnostic difficulties in detecting Crohn's disease in these people [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/crohns-disease/references/\">Baumgart, 2012</a>].</li><li>Drugs — nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may increase the risk of relapse or exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the absolute risk is low [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/crohns-disease/references/\">Gomollon, 2017</a>]. The risk of IBD may be increased in women using oral contraceptive drugs; a meta-analysis of 14 studies (n = 75,815) of people with IBD found that the pooled relative risk for Crohn's disease for women currently using an oral contraceptive was 1.46 [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/crohns-disease/references/\">Cornish et al, 2008</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 772b1ed6-cf48-4df3-a9fb-2a2a2eaba3ad --><!-- end item fae8cd19-a434-4414-940c-0a989bad995f -->","topic":{"id":"a55bf0e9-c7ea-505e-b7ff-5093105336e5","topicId":"7057d96d-a527-4391-84a1-c39953de3eae","topicName":"Crohn's disease","slug":"crohns-disease","lastRevised":"Last revised in August 2020","chapters":[{"id":"9c1b7d20-f572-5a3c-845f-3f4b65f646e1","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"6b9f2bb0-4b7b-5373-ace6-15e38cc8904f","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"2a50fc53-dced-5bb1-83cf-20d5ce4f9e8e","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"a5629107-6649-5a0c-a706-90ad8bf14aa7","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"1a920dcd-3a15-527f-9fc2-97be951c56cc","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"79cdca68-ce3a-5435-bca1-8393c4d809a6","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"123f065a-c1e6-59ef-a0f6-fa3212214c90","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"d3e5c61e-a5b9-586a-8698-69a0c0f79a5f","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"b41011e0-33e6-52d3-9434-5f29d0baeeb8","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"f3bcc082-58a6-51db-a805-173080268884","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"a5948dc8-4eac-58f3-8d64-68a80aeb4059","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
