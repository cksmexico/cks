The challenges of caring can include:<ul><li><strong>Impact on physical and mental health.</strong><ul><li>Evidence suggests that carers can neglect their own health — this may be because it is not a priority because of their caring role, or because they are unable to leave the person they care for in order to attend appointments [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/support-for-adult-carers/references/\">RCGP, 2013</a>].</li><li>Carers are more likely to report a long term condition, disability, or illness compared with non-carers <strong> </strong>and may experience physical injury as a result of caring, for example back and shoulder injuries. Up to 40% of carers experience significant distress and depression<strong> </strong>and, compared with the general population, carers in the UK are almost twice as anxious [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/support-for-adult-carers/references/\">RCGP, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/support-for-adult-carers/references/\">Carers UK, 2019b</a>].</li><li>A national survey of 195,364 carers in England found a poorer health-related quality of life (in relation to mobility, self-care, pain, anxiety, depression, and usual activities) among carers compared with non-carers of similar age, gender, ethnicity, and social deprivation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/support-for-adult-carers/references/\">Thomas, 2015</a>].</li></ul></li><li><strong>Social effects, for example social isolation and loneliness.</strong><ul><li>Compared with the general population, carers are seven times more likely to report being often or always lonely. Caring can also affect relationships and the ability to participate in activities [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/support-for-adult-carers/references/\">RCGP, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/support-for-adult-carers/references/\">Carers UK, 2019b</a>].</li></ul></li><li><strong>Financial difficulties.</strong><ul><li>Financially, carers may face difficulties, and their income may be affected by their caring role. The time and costs of providing care may also result in higher bills and financial pressure [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/support-for-adult-carers/references/\">Carers UK, 2019b</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/support-for-adult-carers/references/\">Treanor, 2019</a>]. There is information to suggest that many carers do not claim all the benefits for which they are eligible [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/support-for-adult-carers/references/\">RCGP, 2014</a>]. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Impact on work and employment.</strong><ul><li>Many carers are working as well as caring, but it can be difficult to balance work, caring, and looking after their own health. Work can be adversely affected by caring due to factors such as tiredness and stress, and the caring role may limit opportunities for promotion [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/support-for-adult-carers/references/\">RCGP, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/support-for-adult-carers/references/\">DHSC, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/support-for-adult-carers/references/\">Carers UK, 2019b</a>].</li><li>One fifth of carers stop work in order to fulfil their caring role, and on average, carers retire 8 years early [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/support-for-adult-carers/references/\">RCGP, 2014</a>].</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 65383cf0-48df-48f9-9ef3-ac4400ac44e1 --><!-- end item a7ce9363-a9b0-4051-9cb0-8f299148f84b -->","topic":{"id":"8a0dcd0d-457e-51f3-bb8d-cb9abed98985","topicId":"535a2cb2-ac55-4c42-ba32-ac4000b1d290","topicName":"Support for adult carers","slug":"support-for-adult-carers","lastRevised":"November 2020","chapters":[{"id":"c8031010-eeca-5ec2-8a2b-5fb3ca2eb166","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"69ec7c8f-cf0d-5dbd-b893-89c2650a72ca","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"49a3aecb-d0b2-58e2-8ec3-fe94f2a9132b","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"936b3c23-1c2f-5003-9f5d-05e063485d44","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"77adc050-2665-545f-89b0-60ee6b0c8116","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"6a2556ad-0860-52f0-a8a0-c57cd81f9263","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"edeeef30-2db3-5c88-8e49-e79f62b6fd87","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"b9e9f803-c81a-59fb-81b0-3e9fcbd97741","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"118bcee7-0fd7-5dad-954c-1746972d2785","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"90a67215-579b-5c33-9bbe-623f00a74969","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"e809a3f4-6c60-5381-a80f-e1cebb45f95a","slug":"nice-quality-standards","fullItemName":"NICE quality standards"},{"id":"64e6b8a1-4285-552a-a894-4fb4b7bb0b17","slug":"qipp","fullItemName":"QIPP"}]},{"id":"f34fb066-09ab-5503-93fb-fadba45fa824","fullItemName":"Background information","slug":"background-information","subChapters":[{"id":"ef6815d9-22a5-5ee6-bdee-c9966934faa6","slug":"definition","fullItemName":"Definition"},{"id":"5d4708a6-fed5-5df6-a61b-6a174317fc0a","slug":"prevalence","fullItemName":"Prevalence"},{"id":"ddaba137-c888-5ff1-bf6a-f53d184ff248","slug":"challenges-experienced-by-carers","fullItemName":"Challenges experienced by carers"},{"id":"6dbe6315-0fab-5dd4-a8ad-069d04509344","slug":"identifying-supporting-carers","fullItemName":"Identifying and supporting carers"}]},{"id":"1a6af021-fb7e-5c66-acde-64d63d957561","fullItemName":"Diagnosis","slug":"diagnosis","subChapters":[{"id":"fdbb1671-2bdc-57f0-81c5-e2e9d29e630e","slug":"identification-of-carers","fullItemName":"Identification of carers"}]},{"id":"71814743-636b-5c02-ac46-4591757d9596","fullItemName":"Management","slug":"management","subChapters":[{"id":"7e7b3147-dd06-5a7a-b31b-9c6308101e23","slug":"management","fullItemName":"Scenario: Management"}]},{"id":"f1647cb9-c52a-5ca9-9803-39bae5e49004","fullItemName":"Supporting evidence","slug":"supporting-evidence","subChapters":[]},{"id":"9a5a5b66-2cd0-54e8-8b71-b30f7804155f","fullItemName":"How this topic was developed","slug":"how-this-topic-was-developed","subChapters":[{"id":"0a4b6a72-fd57-5def-bd99-a2389f0ed876","slug":"search-strategy","fullItemName":"Search strategy"},{"id":"38914d51-a2ad-5908-80e0-4761f9306e28","slug":"stakeholder-engagement","fullItemName":"Stakeholder engagement"},{"id":"f9f3c9c8-020e-5782-9821-b44616e11be0","slug":"evidence-exclusion-criteria","fullItemName":"Evidence exclusion criteria"},{"id":"8e915040-d70c-5bfb-a659-c5c4f704cdfc","slug":"organizational-behavioural-financial-barriers","fullItemName":"Organizational, behavioural and financial barriers"},{"id":"999b57a0-2af4-5dd7-98a5-1b581bec90c4","slug":"declarations-of-interest","fullItemName":"Declarations of interest"}]},{"id":"869c8365-35cf-553b-a805-5ec246be8c55","fullItemName":"References","slug":"references","subChapters":[]}]},"parentChapter":{"id":"f34fb066-09ab-5503-93fb-fadba45fa824","slug":"background-information","fullItemName":"Background information"},"subChapters":[]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
