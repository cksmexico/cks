href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">UK National Screening Committee, 2013</a>], which notes:<ul><li>There is a lack of agreement about what a normal thyroid hormone level is.</li><li>In people who are not unwell, it is difficult to use thyroid test results to decide who should receive treatment.</li><li>Some people's thyroid hormone levels will return to normal without treatment, and these people may not benefit from treatment.</li><li>There is some evidence that there may be harmful effects from treating people with no symptoms of thyroid disease, and further studies are needed to explore this.</li><li>The balance of benefit and harm from screening is not known.</li></ul></li><li>Similarly, the USPSTF statement found evidence that widespread screening for and treatment of thyroid dysfunction in non-pregnant asymptomatic adults does not improve quality of life or cognitive function, and does not lead to clinically significant improvements in blood pressure, body mass index, bone mineral density, or serum lipid levels. It concluded that the evidence is insufficient and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening in this population group cannot be determined [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">LeFevre, 2015</a>].</li><li>The ATA guidelines found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against universal screening for abnormal TSH concentrations in early pregnancy, and similarly insufficient evidence to recommend for or against universal screening for abnormal TSH concentrations preconception [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Alexander, 2017</a>].</li></ul><h4>Clinical criteria for case finding for hypothyroidism</h4><ul><li>The clinical criteria for when screening is appropriate in pre-pregnancy and pregnancy are largely based on the joint UK publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Association for Clinical Biochemisty, 2006</a>], the Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">De Groot et al, 2012</a>], and the ATA guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Alexander, 2017</a>].<ul><li>The information on African countries with insufficient iodine intake during pregnancy is based on a protocol for a systematic review [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Businge, 2019</a>].</li><li>All women with postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) should be offered an annual check of thyroid function and screened prior to and 6–8 weeks after future pregnancies because they have a high risk of permanent hypothyroidism and recurrence in subsequent pregnancies [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Association for Clinical Biochemisty, 2006</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The clinical criteria for when screening is appropriate in non-pregnant asymptomatic adults is based on the joint UK publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Association for Clinical Biochemisty, 2006</a>], the Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">De Groot et al, 2012</a>], and expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Chaker, 2017</a>].<ul><li>Expert opinion in a review article notes that 15% of people with autoimmune hypothyroidism are asymptomatic [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Chaker, 2017</a>].</li><li>The Endocrine Society guideline notes that hypothyroidism is a potentially reversible cause of depression, therefore women with postnatal depression should be screened for hypothyroidism [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">De Groot et al, 2012</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 60649551-1cda-4600-a245-9dac22d73880 --><!-- end item ec16cb1f-b328-475e-a901-69b10e45a4f3 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
