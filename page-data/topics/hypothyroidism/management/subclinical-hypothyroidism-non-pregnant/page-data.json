It is supported by the ETA guideline on subclinical hypothyroidism [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Pearce, 2013</a>], a meta-analysis of LT4 therapy in people with subclinical hypothyroidism [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Feller, 2018</a>], a longitudinal population-based survey [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Roberts, 2018</a>], and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Peeters, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Biondi, 2019</a>].<ul><li>The NICE guideline based its recommendations on limited evidence on the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism.<ul><li>It recommends making treatment decisions based on the results of two measurements of TFTs.</li><li>It notes that a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 5–10 mU/L may return to the reference range without LT4 treatment in 50% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism, whereas a TSH level above 10 mU/L is less likely to normalize spontaneously, and is more often associated with symptoms. As a result, NICE recommends offering LT4 therapy to all adults with a TSH greater than 10 mU/L, as treatment may improve symptoms and may reduce cardiovascular risk.</li><li>The recommendation to offer a 6-month trial of LT4 monotherapy to symptomatic adults less than 65 years of age is based on the experience and expertise of the NICE guideline development group, which found if the TSH level is less than 10 mU/L, LT4 therapy is less likely to provide benefit. NICE concluded that adults under 65 years of age were most likely to derive benefit from LT4 treatment compared with people over 65 years of age. In the older age-group, symptoms were less likely to improve and there was an increased risk of potential harms from suppressing TSH.</li><li>The recommendations on the frequency of monitoring if a person has untreated subclinical hypothyroidism, or LT4 therapy has been stopped, is based on the NICE clinical guideline, which states that factors suggesting underlying thyroid disease should also be taken into account when deciding whether or not to treat subclinical hypothyroidism, as there is generally an over-reliance on TSH levels.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendations on the use of LT4 monotherapy are partially supported by the ETA guideline on subclinical hypothyroidism [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Pearce, 2013</a>].<ul><li>This recommends checking TFTs on two separate occasions after a 2–3 month interval to confirm a diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism. This approach is further supported by expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Peeters, 2017</a>].</li><li>CKS notes that the ETA guideline gives an age cut-off, and suggests LT4 treatment for people with a TSH greater than 10 mU/L if they are aged less than 65 years, which contrasts with the NICE recommendation to offer LT4 therapy to all adults with this TSH result, irrespective of age.</li><li>It supports the NICE recommendation to offer a trial of LT4 monotherapy to symptomatic adults less than 65 years of age with a TSH level less than 10 mU/L, and advises monitoring TFTs at least annually once the serum TSH level is stable. It notes that few people with subclinical hypothyroidism have typical symptoms of hypothyroidism.</li><li>It provides recommendations on rechecking and managing lipids if clinically appropriate.</li></ul></li><li>A meta-analysis of 21 randomized clinical trials of moderate-to-high quality (n = 2192 adults) found [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Feller, 2018</a>]:<ul><li>That LT4 therapy was not associated with improvements in general quality of life and thyroid-related symptoms compared with placebo after a minimum follow-up period of three months. It concluded that the routine use of LT4 therapy in adults with subclinical hypothyroidism is not recommended, taking into account the burden of lifelong drug treatment and uncertainty on potential harms. This appears to support a selective approach of considering LT4 treatment for specific patient groups rather than all people with a diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism.</li></ul></li><li>A large, longitudinal population-based survey of older adults with normal TFTs or subclinical hypothyroidism in primary care (n = 2936) found [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Roberts, 2018</a>]:<ul><li>There was a high stability of thyroid function over a five-year period, and of those people classified as subclinically hypothyroid at baseline, only 2% progressed to overt hypothyroidism. This appears to support an approach of infrequent TFT monitoring, if there are no features suggesting underlying thyroid disease.</li></ul></li><li>Expert opinion in a review article supports the recommendations on when to offer a trial of LT4 monotherapy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Biondi, 2019</a>].<ul><li>It notes that the rationale for treatment is based on the potential for decreasing the risk of complications of subclinical hypothyroidism and the possibility of preventing progression to overt hypothyroidism. The potential benefits of LT4 therapy need to be weighed against the risk of causing iatrogenic subclinical or overt hyperthyroidism.</li></ul></li><li>Data in an additional review article suggest that LT4 treatment is unlikely to reduce symptoms in people with modest elevations in TSH levels and minimal symptoms at baseline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Peeters, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Considering referral for treatment-refractory subclinical hypothyroidism</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to consider specialist referral if there are persistently abnormal TFTs, if underlying causes are managed or excluded, is based on the ETA guidelines on subclinical hypothyroidism [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Pearce, 2013</a>] and central hypothyroidism [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Persani, 2018</a>].<ul><li>Some people with secondary hypothyroidism with a predominant hypothalamic defect can have high TSH concentrations which do not have full biological activity. In these cases, TSH elevations may be similar to that seen in subclinical hypothyroidism, and may lead to misdiagnosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypothyroidism/references/\">Persani, 2018</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation to consider specialist referral if there are persistent symptoms if alternative diagnoses have been excluded is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice. This approach is also supported by the expert opinion of previous external reviewers of this CKS topic.</li></ul></div><!-- end field 21d28be3-aeda-4633-a8e3-cdc6d67f0577 --><!-- end item 82b69455-5123-42e9-a33b-2a28e81576a9 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
