lifelong abstinent quitters (after taking into account a relapse rate of 35% after 1 year).</li></ul></li><li>Evidence from Cochrane reviews shows that combining medication and behavioural support increases the chance of quitting at 6 months compared with brief advice or support only [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/smoking-cessation/references/\">Stead, 2016</a>] and that giving behavioural support (face-to-face or by telephone) to people using smoking cessation medication increases their chance of success [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/smoking-cessation/references/\">Stead, 2015</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Evidence for drug treatments</h5><ul><li>NRT, varenicline and bupropion are effective smoking

between preparations.</li><li>A combination of NRT (in the form of a patch plus a fast-acting form of NRT) is more effective than using a single type of NRT. </li></ul></li><li>Bupropion is as
