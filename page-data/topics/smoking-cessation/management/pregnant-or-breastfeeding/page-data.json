stopping in pregnancy and after childbirth</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/smoking-cessation/references/\">NICE, 2010</a>], and <em>Smoking: harm

(NCSCT) <em>Smoking Cessation: a briefing for midwifery staff</em><em> </em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/smoking-cessation/references/\">NCSCT,

internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/smoking-cessation/references/\">Lancaster, 2017</a>].</p><h5>Counselling</h5><ul><li>There is good evidence that individual smoking cessation counselling is more effective at helping people to stop smoking compared to receiving minimal support [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/smoking-cessation/references/\">Lancaster, 2017</a>]. </li><li>Group counselling has also been shown to be more effective than self-help and other less intensive forms of support [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/smoking-cessation/references/\">Stead, 2017</a>].  </li><li>There is not sufficient evidence to conclude whether group or individual counselling is more effective.</li></ul><h5>Carbon monoxide (CO) testing</h5><ul><li>Due to the heightened consequences of failing to identify pregnant women who smoke, an appropriate cut-off point for CO testing in pregnancy is lower than for the general adult population [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/smoking-cessation/references/\">NCSCT, 2014</a>]. </li><li>All pregnant women with a CO reading of 7 parts per million (ppm) or above should be referred to stop smoking services [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/smoking-cessation/references/\">NICE, 2013d</a>].  <ul><li>However, it is unclear what constitutes the best cut-off point for determining smoking status, as low levels may go undetected or be indistinguishable from exposure to second-hand smoke and so it is best to use a low cut-off point to avoid missing someone who may need help to quit.</li></ul></li><li>Two recent studies have suggested that the cut-off point should be 4 ppm [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/smoking-cessation/references/\">NCSCT, 2014</a>]. </li><li>Success of abstinence is measured as 10ppm or less in the general
