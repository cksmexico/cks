recommendation to clarify what the person means by tiredness/fatigue is based on expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Morrison, 2001</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Rosenthal,

internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Bansal, 2016</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in review articles notes the importance of assessing the nature, impact, and duration of fatigue [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Fukuda, 1994</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Rodriguez, 2000</a>].</li><li>The recommendation on taking a sleep history is based on a population-based survey on fatigue [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Galland-Decker, 2019</a>] and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Rodriguez, 2000</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\"

2008</a>].</li><li>The recommendation on asking about lifestyle and psychosocial factors is based on the fact that fatigue is often associated with psychosocial stress, and may be caused by depression. A systematic review on the differential diagnosis of tiredness stresses the importance of assessing a person's mental health and psychosocial wellbeing [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Stadje, 2016</a>].<ul><li>This is supported by expert opinion in a review article that states that a psychosocial history should include asking about depression and anxiety, alcohol or other substance misuse, and medication use [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Fukuda, 1994</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article notes that anxiety and depression can cause fatigue themselves, but acknowledges that these conditions can also complicate CFS, particularly if symptoms remain unexplained, there is unpredictability of relapses, and there is no improvement in symptoms. Expert opinion stresses the early detection and appropriate treatment of depression is important [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Bansal, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation to ask about chronic conditions that may cause fatigue is based on different studies in the literature that found associations with multiple possible comorbidities.<ul><li>A systematic review of 26 studies investigating the differential diagnosis of tiredness in primary care found that depression was the most common cause (seen in 18.5% of people), with other causes such as anaemia (2.8%) and malignancy (0.6%) being less common. A diagnosis of CFS was identified in 2% of cases. The authors noted variations in the definition of tiredness, study populations, and methodologies. It suggests a low positive-predictive value for the likelihood of malignancy in people with tiredness in primary care, especially for people presenting with tiredness as an isolated symptom, and notes that serious underlying disease is rare [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Stadje, 2016</a>].</li><li>A population-based cross-sectional survey (n = 2848) found that obesity, insomnia and sleep disturbance, depression, anaemia, and low self-rated health status were positively associated with fatigue, and recommended that these conditions should be part of an assessment of fatigue. The study did not, however, distinguish between physical and mental fatigue in its fatigue assessment tool [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Galland-Decker, 2019</a>].</li><li>A cross-sectional study in Poland of people presenting with self-reported fatigue (n = 1400) found that 93% had an associated chronic condition, including neurological, neurodegenerative, psychiatric, and immunological disorders [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Slomko, 2019</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The information on possible symptoms suggesting CFS is based on the NICE clinical guideline, which notes that symptoms may fluctuate in severity and change over time [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">NICE, 2007</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to ask about comorbid conditions that may be associated with CFS is based on a cohort study exploring different symptom-based phenotypes in people attending specialist CFS clinics [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Collin, 2018</a>].<ul><li>People presenting with a polysymptomatic phenotype were more likely to have comorbid migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, depression, and anxiety compared with people with a oligosymptomatic (few symptoms) phenotype.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation to assess for medication that may be a cause of fatigue is based on expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Rodriguez, 2000</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Morrison, 2001</a>], and [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Rosenthal, 2008</a>].</li></ul><h4>Assessing for red flags</h4><ul><li>The information on red flags to assess for is largely based on the NICE clinical guidelines on CFS [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">NICE, 2007</a>] and on suspected cancer [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>]. It is also pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><h4>Clinical features on examination</h4><ul><li>The recommendation on performing an appropriate physical and mental state examination is extrapolated from the NICE clinical guideline on CFS [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">NICE, 2007</a>] and is based on expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Fukuda, 1994</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Bansal, 2016</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field e94802b9-6233-46cd-8664-e35aba1db298 --><!-- end item 7d006ab3-84e6-4615-8e38-bdb05021fa01 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
