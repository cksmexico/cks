arrange referral to a specialist CFS service and the appropriate timescales for referral, for possible cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and/or graded exercise therapy (GET), are largely based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">NICE, 2007</a>].<ul><li>NICE highlights that any decision to refer should be based on their needs, the type, duration, complexity, and severity of their symptoms, and the presence of comorbidities.</li><li>NICE recommends an individualised, person-centred programme should be offered to people with CFS to maintain or ideally gradually extend their physical, emotional, and cognitive capacity, and to help manage the impact of symptoms.</li><li>A NICE evidence review found that CBT and/or GET should be offered to people with mild or moderate CFS, as these interventions show the clearest research evidence of benefit.</li></ul></li><li>A Cochrane systematic review of 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs; n = 1043 adults) found that CBT was effective at reducing symptoms of fatigue compared with usual care, and may be more effective than other psychological therapies (relaxation, counselling, and education/support). The findings at follow up were based on a small number of studies and were inconsistent, such that the duration of any benefit from CBT was unclear [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Price, 2008</a>].</li><li>A Cochrane systematic review of eight RCTs (n = 1,518 adults) on the effects of exercise therapy for CFS found that this intervention probably has a positive effect on fatigue compared with usual care or 'passive therapies'. Control groups included people undertaking CBT, adaptive pacing, and taking antidepressant therapy. Owing to limited evidence, it was difficult to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of alternative interventions [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Larun, 2019</a>].</li><li>A US systematic review of 35 treatment trials found low- to moderate-quality evidence that counselling therapy and GET compared with no treatment, relaxation, or support improved outcomes of fatigue, function, global improvement, and fitness for work in some trials; counselling therapy also improved quality of life outcomes. The authors noted the included studies were heterogenous regarding study size, duration, applicability, and methodological quality [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tiredness-fatigue-in-adults/references/\">Smith, 2015</a>].</li></ul><h5>Considering arranging specialist referral</h5><ul><li>The recommendation on when to consider referral for people with persistent, unexplained tiredness/fatigue <em>not </em>meeting the criteria for a diagnosis of CFS is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.
