based on a prospective cohort study of teething symptoms [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/teething/references/\">Macknin et al, 2000</a>] and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/teething/references/\">Wilson and Mason, 2002</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\"

2013</a>].<ul><li>A diagnosis of teething should only be made once other systemic or local causes have been excluded [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/teething/references/\">Wilson and Mason, 2002</a>].</li><li>A review of prospective studies found that no specific symptoms or clusters of symptoms can reliably predict the emergence of a tooth or differentiate teething symptoms from symptoms of early serious infection, and concluded that teething is a diagnosis of exclusion [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/teething/references/\">Tighe and Roe, 2007</a>]. CKS considers this to be particularly important in infants who are systemically unwell or in severe distress.</li><li>This is supported by the findings of a prospective cohort study that found no symptom cluster could reliably predict the imminent emergence of a tooth [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/teething/references/\">Macknin et al, 2000</a>].</li></ul></li><li>A Scottish perspective study highlights the potential inappropriateness of teething as a diagnosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/teething/references/\">Swann, 1979</a>]:<ul><li>Fifty children (aged 3 to 30 months) were admitted to hospital over one year with symptoms that were attributed to teething by their parents or GP. An organic cause for the symptoms (such as upper respiratory tract infection, febrile convulsion, bronchitis, and eczema) was identified in 48 children, which included one child diagnosed with meningitis. No known cause was found in the remaining two children.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Symptoms and signs associated with teething</h4><ul><li>Expert opinion in a review article notes there is variation of opinion in the literature on the significance and association of symptoms with teething [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/teething/references/\">McIntyre and McIntyre, 2002</a>].</li><li>This view is supported by a non-randomized clinical trial of teething symptoms, which suggests this may reflect differences in sample size, age, the method of data collection, and the types of symptoms studied. It highlights that reported symptoms may be coincidental rather than causally associated with teething [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/teething/references/\">Memarpour, 2015</a>].<ul><li>The trial of teething symptoms (n = 270 children under 3 years of age) found the most frequent teething symptoms were drooling, sleep disturbance, and irritability (the latter was presumed to be secondary to gum pain). Low-grade increases in body temperature were observed on the day of tooth eruption only, but these remained within the normal temperature range. There was no significant correlation between perceived fever as reported by mothers and temperature readings obtained by the study investigators, and the study concluded there was no association between tooth eruption and systemic symptoms such as fever and diarrhoea.</li></ul></li><li>A large international meta-analysis of 16 observational studies (n = 3506) of local and systemic signs and symptoms during teething in children aged 0–3 years found that gum irritation, irritability, and drooling were most commonly reported [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/teething/references/\">Massignan, 2016</a>].<ul><li>There was significant heterogeneity between the studies, and methodological limitations included different definitions of tooth eruption, use of subjective measures (parental observations of symptoms), and long intervals between examinations.</li></ul></li><li>A small prospective, longitudinal study undertaken in Brazil of symptoms and signs of teething the day before and after tooth eruption (n = 47 healthy infants) found that irritability, increased salivation, runny nose, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, rash, and sleep disturbance were associated with primary tooth eruption, and concluded that severe systemic signs such as markedly raised temperature were not associated with teething [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/teething/references/\">Ramos-Jorges, 2011</a>].<ul><li>The authors noted that some of the symptoms, such as irritability, loss of appetite, and increased salivation, were subjective.</li></ul></li><li>An Australian questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey of the health beliefs of child health professionals and parents on teething symptoms noted that symptoms are typically infrequent and mild [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/teething/references/\">Wake and Hesketh, 2002</a>].<ul><li>The number of different symptoms attributable to teething differed across professional groups.</li></ul></li><li>A large US prospective, cohort study of parentally-reported symptoms associated with teething (n = 125 healthy infants) found that increased biting, drooling, gum-rubbing, irritability, sucking, wakefulness, ear-rubbing, facial rash, decreased appetite, and mild temperature elevation were significantly associated with teething [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/teething/references/\">Macknin et al, 2000</a>].<ul><li>Symptoms were only significantly more frequent in the four days before a tooth emergence, the day of the emergence, and three days after it.</li><li>No symptom occurred in more than 35% of teething infants during each teething period, and no symptom occurred 20% more often in the teething period than in the non-teething period.</li><li>The authors noted that the study may have been subject to biased parental reporting of symptoms.</li></ul></li><li>A meta-analysis of six studies found no association between primary tooth eruption and fever in the overall analysis, however a sub-group analysis using only rectal temperature measurements found an association [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/teething/references/\">Nemezio, 2017</a>].<ul><li>Heterogeneity among the meta-analysis studies in the methods of temperature measurement and study design was, however, noted.</li></ul></li><li>The information that symptoms associated with teething tend to decrease with age is based on a meta-analysis of signs and symptoms during teething [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/teething/references/\">Massignan, 2016</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to examine the mouth and gums to look for signs of tooth eruption is based on expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/teething/references/\">Ashley, 2001</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/teething/references/\">Tighe and Roe, 2007</a>] and is also pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><!-- end field 8b4d809b-f591-436c-83db-971786801617 --><!-- end item b96b447d-a1e5-4d51-b3e3-ea05c6695a77 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
