Ultrasound or aspiration of the breast lump can confirm the diagnosis, and in some cases, treatment with aspiration or surgical excision may be needed.</li></ul><h5>Suspected ductal infection</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on treatment of suspected Candida infection are extrapolated from the Statement by the NIFN on the treatment of Candida infection of the nipple, which states that ductal infection may require 14–28 days of fluconazole treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">National Infant Feeding Network, 2014a</a>].</li><li>CKS did not find any good-quality evidence on the treatment of suspected bacterial ductal infection, so the recommendations on management are extrapolated from the regimens recommended for the treatment of mastitis in breastfeeding women. For more information, see the relevant basis for recommendation section in the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/mastitis-breast-abscess/\">Mastitis and breast abscess</a>.</li></ul><h5>Suspected nipple damage</h5><ul><li>The recommendation on continuing to breastfeed regularly is based on the fact that this is required to maintain sufficient milk production.</li><li>The recommendation on arranging referral for possible division of ankyloglossia (tongue-tie) is based on the NICE interventional procedure guidance, which found limited evidence that this procedure can improve breastfeeding problems [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">NICE, 2005</a>], and expert opinion in a review article on nipple pain [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">Kent et al, 2015</a>].</li><li>The recommendation on considering the application of expressed breast milk to the nipple is based on a Cochrane systematic review of four heterogenous randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials (n = 656) of women with nipple pain. The authors concluded that 'the results from these four trials of good methodological quality suggested that applying nothing or just expressed breast milk may be equally or more beneficial in the short-term experience of nipple pain than the application of an ointment such as lanolin.' [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">Dennis et al, 2014</a>].</li><li>The recommendation on prescribing topical antibiotics for suspected bacterial infection of the nipple is based on expert opinion in a review article on breastfeeding problems that these agents can help healing [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">Amir, 2014</a>].</li><li>The recommendation on prescribing topical and second-line oral antifungal drug treatment for suspected candida infection of the nipple is based on the NIFN statement on candida infection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">National Infant Feeding Network, 2014a</a>].</li></ul><h5>Suspected skin conditions</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to treat eczema or psoriasis of the nipple with topical preparations applied immediately after a breastfeed is based on the fact that this provides maximum contact time before the next breastfeed [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">Berens et al, 2016</a>].</li></ul><h5>Suspected nipple vasospasm and Raynaud's disease of the nipple</h5><ul><li>These recommendations are based on an ABM clinical protocol [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">Berens et al, 2016</a>], expert opinion in review articles on breastfeeding problems [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">Amir, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">Amir, 2016</a>], and a retrospective case review of 22 women with Raynaud's disease of the nipple [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">Barrett et al, 2013</a>].</li><li>The recommendation on considering the use of nifedipine is based on the fact that this drug promotes relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells and leads to vasodilatation, which may provide symptom relief [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">Barrett et al, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">Goundry et al, 2012</a>]. CKS recommends specialist referral before this is started, however, as there is limited evidence on its effectiveness in treating nipple pain, and it is an off-label indication.</li></ul><h5>Suspected low milk supply</h5><ul><li>The recommendation on ensuring effective infant positioning and attachment is based on the fact that this is needed for an adequate milk supply, so advice and support from a skilled breastfeeding specialist may help to resolve problems of perceived low milk supply [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">Amir, 2014</a>].</li><li>The recommendations on self-management strategies to improve milk supply are based on the ABM clinical protocol on the use of galactogogues [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, 2011</a>].</li><li>The recommendation on considering the use of a galactogogue if self-management measures do not help is based on the fact that short-term use of domperidone (a dopamine antagonist, off-label indication) may improve milk supply, as it increases maternal prolactin secretion [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">National Infant Feeding Network, 2014b</a>]. CKS recommends specialist referral before this is started, however, as there is very limited evidence on its effectiveness, and there is no direct correlation between maternal prolactin levels and rates of milk production [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">Amir, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">UKMi, 2015</a>].</li><li>In addition, domperidone has rarely been associated with potentially life-threatening adverse effects, such as ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">UKMi, 2015</a>].</li></ul><h5>Suspected milk oversupply</h5><ul><li>These recommendations are based on the WHO publication on infant feeding [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">WHO, 2009</a>], expert opinion in a review article on the treatment of maternal milk oversupply [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">Eglash, 2014</a>], and a review article on breastfeeding problems [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">Amir, 2016</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to offer one breast for each feed is based on the 'block feeding' strategy, which allows the other breast to rest, allowing the fullness to provide feedback to the breast to subsequently reduce milk supply [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">Eglash, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breastfeeding-problems/references/\">Berens et al, 2016</a>].</li></ul><h5>Considering referral to a breast specialist if refractory symptoms</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is pragmatic based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><!-- end field dfca52b5-32f9-4fc7-8d85-acde7fb45b83 --><!-- end item 0e486c6e-fd39-4929-bfcd-00adbf7377dc -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
