This is classified as:<ul><li>Primary erythrocytosis caused by polycythaemia vera, when the increased red-cell mass is caused by neoplastic proliferation of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. Thrombocytosis and leucocytosis may also occur with polycythaemia vera.</li><li>Secondary erythrocytosis, when the increased red-cell mass is caused by an increased production of erythropoietin. Most commonly erythropoietin is increased due to a physiological response to chronic tissue hypoxia caused by chronic lung disease. Inappropriate production of erythropoietin by the kidney can also occur with certain kidney disorders, renal tumours, and hepatomas.</li><li>Idiopathic erythrocytosis, when the increased red-cell mass has no identifiable cause.</li></ul></li><li>Apparent erythrocytosis is defined as increased haematocrit and haemoglobin concentration with a normal red-cell mass. It is caused by a low plasma volume that most commonly occurs in people taking thiazide diuretics, and those who are heavy smokers or heavy alcohol users.</li><li>Erythrocytosis causes increased blood viscosity, leading to elevated risk of thrombosis and cardiovascular events. Other complications vary depending on the type and underlying cause of polycythaemia:<ul><li>Polycythaemia vera — the risk of haemorrhage may be increased, particularly in people with severe thrombocytosis. In a minority of people, the disease progresses to the myelofibrotic stage, where the bone marrow is replaced by dense fibrous bands of reticulin and cytopenias are common. Rarely, progression to acute myeloid leukaemia occurs.</li><li>Secondary erythrocytosis — prognosis is dependent on the underlying condition.</li></ul></li><li>To confirm a diagnosis of erythrocytosis, a blood sample (taken without a tourniquet, if possible) is required. Erythrocytosis is defined as a haematocrit of more than 0.56 in women and more than 0.60 in men, however, this can be caused by primary, secondary, or apparent erythrocytosis.</li><li>Features which can differentiate the diagnosis include:<ul><li>Specific clinical features of polycythaemia vera, such as generalized pruritus after bathing, splenomegaly, thrombocytosis, and neutrophil leucocytosis.</li><li>Presence of potential underlying causes of secondary erythrocytosis, such as chronic lung disease, cyanotic heart disease, or chronic renal disorders.</li><li>Presence of factors which raise the suspicion for apparent erythrocytosis.</li></ul></li><li>Additional tests that can confirm a diagnosis of polycythaemia vera include JAK2 V617F mutation testing, and measurement of erythropoietin levels (usually reduced in polycythaemia vera, often raised in secondary erythrocytosis).</li><li>If the person has suspected:<ul><li>Apparent erythrocytosis — the underlying cause should be managed where possible and the haematocrit remeasured after two months to confirm a reduction.</li><li>Secondary erythrocytosis — referral to an appropriate specialist is usually required to manage the underlying cause. The haematocrit should be remeasured two months after the implementation of any measures to manage the underlying condition (such as oxygen therapy for hypoxic lung disease).</li><li>Polycythaemia vera — referral to a haematologist is recommended for consideration of treatment with aspirin, venesection, and in people at high risk of thrombosis, pharmacological cytoreduction.</li></ul></li><li>Cardiovascular risk factors (including hyperlipidaemia, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes) should be managed for all people with erythrocytosis of any cause.</li></ul><!-- end field 7e449b6d-e674-4235-b810-3fca1f79b92a --><!-- end item 2c75120c-e2f6-4a08-8119-1e86fb446f24 -->","topic":{"id":"fa6be70e-4297-5c9a-b3cd-9583f15e3111","topicId":"fd54e0c5-4fe5-450d-9784-91b5e47c8754","topicName":"Polycythaemia/erythrocytosis","slug":"polycythaemia-erythrocytosis","aliases":["Erythrocytosis/polycythaemia"],"chapters":[{"id":"695f9a30-5f1b-5c8c-b771-0c9194a05dbe","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"7dd62db3-3d83-5397-87de-2926d3fd4a22","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"fe394ca3-8f2b-5b5b-97cf-db1e470cb964","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"63325ec1-5a65-517d-b0aa-d0e73bebbfca","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"d7d77004-b1a3-5b51-b127-56e529c85135","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"43b989c9-04a9-5339-b325-9131b5be941b","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"dd6ff7fe-7c84-572b-8476-d38ff3f127b6","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"b5793099-ce5d-5936-b15e-74b920fb9648","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"ff345f15-3d9a-5bde-8daf-a7935cbaf03a","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"f3fd1887-7475-5781-8fbf-fe5899828386","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"e0f239a5-035b-518f-b47b-e9c2ba32eac2","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
