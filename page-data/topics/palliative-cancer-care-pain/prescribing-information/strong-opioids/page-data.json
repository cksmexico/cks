NICE identified 21 randomized controlled trials that compared the effectiveness of immediate-release morphine with sustained-released morphine, and immediate-release oxycodone with sustained-release oxycodone. NICE found evidence that immediate-release opioids and sustained-released opioids had equivalent efficacy in both the titration and maintenance phase, in terms of pain relief, adverse effects, and health-related quality of life.

It is important to remember that:<ul><li>There are differences in opinion regarding dose conversion ratios — current practice for converting opioid doses is based on pharmacokinetic drug data (such as bioavailability after oral administration) from observational and uncontrolled studies, and on expert opinion and experience.</li><li>Reported equi-analgesic dose ratios vary widely among strong opioids.</li><li>When converting from one opioid to another, regular assessment and reassessment of efficacy and adverse effects is essential because of the lack of evidence on equi-analgesic dose ratios and inter-individual variations. Most specialists would advocate applying the calculation and then allowing a relative dose reduction in case there is incomplete cross-tolerance, which would result in a much greater clinical effect than anticipated.</li><li>Methadone should only be initiated by a specialist because it has a long and unpredictable half-life, with considerable inter-individual variation, and requires careful monitoring.</li><li>See Table 3 for information on approximate equivalent potencies of oral opioids to oral morphine which is produced by the UKMI in the Q&A document <em>What are the equivalent doses of oral morphine to other oral opioids when used as analgesics in adult palliative care? </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-cancer-care-pain/references/\">McKie, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li><li>Particular attention to monitoring and dose titration up or down is needed when:<ul><li>Switching between opioids at high doses.</li><li>There has been a recent rapid escalation of the first opioid.</li></ul></li><li>In primary care, when switching the route of administration of one strong opioid to another, the most common switch is from oral morphine sulphate to subcutaneous diamorphine or morphine. See table 4.</li><li>Diamorphine is much more soluble than morphine and therefore easier to administer in higher doses. It is also compatible with most other drugs which may need to be administered by a subcutaneous infusion. However, morphine is preferred in most cases as most people do not require doses large enough to cause solubility issues:<ul><li>Parenteral diamorphine is approximately three times as potent as oral morphine, so the total daily dosage of oral morphine should be divided by three to obtain the 24-hour subcutaneous dose of diamorphine. See Table 3.</li><li>The oral to subcutaneous potency ratio of morphine is between 1:2 and 1:3 (that is, the subcutaneous dose is one third to one half of the oral dose). In practice, most centres divide the oral dose by two and re-titrate as necessary.
