It is usually well tolerated, has well-established efficacy and safety in clinical practice, and is familiar to most practitioners [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-cancer-care-pain/references/\">SIGN, 2008</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-cancer-care-pain/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Cancer, 2016</a>]. Morphine is available as a wide variety of oral formulations, allowing flexibility in dosing regimens.</li><li>For the initial treatment of pain, the recommendation to offer either immediate release or sustained release morphine is based on an evidence review performed by NICE [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-cancer-care-pain/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Cancer, 2016</a>]. NICE identified 21 randomized controlled trials that compared the effectiveness of immediate-release morphine with sustained-released morphine, and immediate release oxycodone with sustained release oxycodone. NICE found evidence that immediate release opioids and sustained released opioids had equivalent efficacy in both the titration and maintenance phase, in terms of pain relief, adverse effects, and health-related quality of life. The NICE guideline development group were unable to recommend one formulation over another and agreed that offering the person a choice between immediate release and sustained release formulation would be likely to improve adherence.</li><li>For first-line maintenance treatment, NICE found no evidence that fentanyl, buprenorphine or oxycodone were more effective than morphine in terms of pain relief. The NICE guideline development group concluded that morphine was an effective and inexpensive opioid analgesic. Although there was evidence that morphine may result in a small increase in gastrointestinal adverse effects when compared with fentanyl transdermal patches, the NICE guideline development group felt that these could be managed by adjunctive treatments such as an anti-emetic or a laxative. A cost-effectiveness analysis found that the benefits of fentanyl patches with regards to adverse effects was not cost effective. Therefore the NICE guideline development group agreed that oral sustained morphine should be offered as first-line treatment and opioid transdermal patches should not be used routinely as first-line maintenance treatment.</li><li>The NICE guideline development group recommended immediate release morphine for break through pain. This was based on the clinical experience of the guideline development group.</li></ul><h5>Subcutaneous opioids as an alternative to oral morphine</h5><ul><li>For people who have unstable analgesic requirements, rapid analgesic titration is required, therefore subcutaneous infusions are more appropriate than transdermal patches [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-cancer-care-pain/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Cancer, 2016</a>].</li><li>NICE found no published evidence that compared the effectiveness of subcutaneous morphine, with either subcutaneous diamorphine or oxycodone as first-line treatment for people with advanced disease who were unable to tolerate an oral opioid. NICE recommends that the subcutaneous infusion with the lowest acquisition cost should be used [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-cancer-care-pain/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Cancer, 2016</a>]. At the time of writing, morphine injection has the lowest acquisition cost. CKS has therefore recommended the use of morphine injection for people with acute severe pain. In addition, following on from a protracted supply problem with diamorphine which has been resolved, many palliative care centres now use morphine in preference to diamorphine [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-cancer-care-pain/references/\">Twycross et al, 2009</a>]. Diamorphine is much more soluble than morphine and is suitable to use when large amounts of subcutaneous morphine are required (e.g. 360 mg every 24 hours) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-cancer-care-pain/references/\">Twycross et al, 2009</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-cancer-care-pain/references/\">Northern England Clinical Networks, 2016</a>].</li></ul><h5>Opioid patches as an alternative to oral morphine</h5><ul><li>Expert opinion in palliative care guidelines suggests that if pain is stable and the person cannot take oral medication, transdermal opioid administration can be considered [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-cancer-care-pain/references/\">Hanks et al, 2001</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-cancer-care-pain/references/\">SIGN, 2008</a>].</li><li>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has issued advice that fentanyl patches should be used only in people who have previously tolerated opioids because there is a risk of significant respiratory depression in people who are opioid naive [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-cancer-care-pain/references/\">MHRA, 2008</a>]. Because of these safety issues, CKS recommends seeking specialist advice before starting fentanyl patches. This recommendation is based on expert opinion from the Palliative Care Formulary [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-cancer-care-pain/references/\">Twycross, 2014</a>] and reviewers of this CKS topic.</li><li>NICE found evidence from quality RCTs that compared transdermal fentanyl with transdermal buprenorphine.

More recent editions of the Palliative Care Formulary [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-cancer-care-pain/references/\">Twycross, 2014</a>] and the British National Formulary [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-cancer-care-pain/references/\">BNF 72, 2016</a>] now advocate this approach.</li></ul><h5>Immediate-release fentanyl products</h5><ul><li>CKS has not recommended immediate-release fentanyl products to manage breakthrough pain. This recommendation is based on an evidence review conducted by NICE. Specialist advice should be sought if these medicines are being considered.</li><li>Although immediate-release fentanyl products have a faster onset of action than immediate-release morphine [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-cancer-care-pain/references/\">Davies et al, 2009</a>], there are a number of concerns regarding the potential practical and safety implications of prescribing these medicines. For example, they are not bioequivalent, the dose titration is complex, and serious adverse effects and deaths have been reported when they are incorrectly used [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-cancer-care-pain/references/\">Twycross, 2014</a>].</li><li>NICE acknowledged that there is limited evidence that fast acting fentanyl preparations are effective for managing breakthrough pain. However, the NICE guideline development group felt that the significant higher costs of these products could not be justified and recommended that these products should not be offered. NICE found:<ul><li>Evidence from two randomized controlled trials (low to moderate quality) that when compared with immediate-release oral morphine, fentanyl nasal spray was associated with better pain improvement at 15 and 30 minutes but not at 45 or 60 minutes.</li><li>Evidence from one study (low quality), that when compared with immediate release oral morphine, transmucosal fentanyl was associated with better pain improvement at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Immediate release oxycodone</h5><ul><li>CKS has not recommended immediate-release oxycodone to manage breakthrough pain. Although NICE found no published evidence comparing immediate-release oxycodone with immediate-release morphine for breakthrough pain, they acknowledge that morphine and oxycodone are similar with regards to efficacy and adverse effects. Morphine is significantly cheaper than oxycodone and therefore the NICE guideline development group decided to recommend immediate release morphine instead of immediate-release oxycodone.</li></ul><!-- end field f3358a1a-29f2-4ebb-97d0-5019fc4f3b98 --><!-- end item 7dbc4806-065c-45d3-8306-add1b1fd7a67 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"9d5b9c74-9b7d-5556-8609-065d134883ba","slug":"advice","fullItemName":"Advice","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field a482e66f-983a-42ff-95a5-f5ca9fcd261c --><h3>What advice should I give regarding strong opioids?</h3><!-- end field a482e66f-983a-42ff-95a5-f5ca9fcd261c -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item ee0e953b-f63f-4883-92d0-68cd3552b318 --><!-- begin field 8b21bbd2-37e9-4ee0-90ad-56355de0228a --><ul><li>Ask the person if they have any specific concerns regarding treatment with a strong opioid, for example addiction, tolerance or adverse effects.</li><li><strong>Reassure the person that:</strong><ul><li>Strong opioids are not addictive when they are used to treat pain.</li><li>Tolerance may occur but this should not affect how their pain is managed.</li><li>Strong opioids are being prescribed because of the level of pain they are experiencing and not because they are near to the end of life.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Provide verbal and written information on:</strong><ul><li>Why a strong opioid is being prescribed and how it should be taken.</li><li>The indications for strong opioids, how effective they are, how quickly they take to work and how long pain relief should last.<ul><li>For more information, see the prescribing information on <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-cancer-care-pain/prescribing-information/strong-opioids/\">Strong opioids</a>.</li></ul></li><li>What <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-cancer-care-pain/prescribing-information/strong-opioids/#management-of-opioid-adverse-effects\">adverse effects</a> may occur (including signs of toxicity) and how these are usually managed.</li><li>Safe storage of strong opioids.<ul><li>Strong opioids should be kept in a safe place out of the reach of children and stored in the original container.</li><li>Any unused strong opioids should be returned to a pharmacy.</li></ul></li><li>Who to contact out of hours (especially during the titration phase), when they will be followed up and how frequently their treatment will be reviewed.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 8b21bbd2-37e9-4ee0-90ad-56355de0228a --><!-- end item ee0e953b-f63f-4883-92d0-68cd3552b318 -->","subChapters":[{"id":"1ecb3369-05b4-59f2-9365-dc457e80adb8","slug":"basis-for-recommendation-66f","fullItemName":"Basis for recommendation","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field a8dfa687-e060-408b-8f43-fa673981d58a --><h4>Basis for recommendation</h4><!-- end field a8dfa687-e060-408b-8f43-fa673981d58a -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 66f7129a-6552-4022-a6ee-0a0d911a755b --><!-- begin field 871c4d6e-6580-48ba-b928-b06b56cfd8e7 --><p>These recommendations are based on guidance published by; the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE):<em>Opioids in palliative care: safe and effective prescribing of strong opioids for pain in palliative care of adults </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-cancer-care-pain/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Cancer, 2016</a>].</p><ul><li>The NICE guideline development group considered patient concerns had a significant impact on whether or not a patient would take a strong opioid and therefore recommended that the person's concerns should be explored when offering treatment with a strong opioid.</li><li>The NICE guideline development group recommended a minimum level of information should be offered to people starting strong opioids as this can be a time of great anxiety.
