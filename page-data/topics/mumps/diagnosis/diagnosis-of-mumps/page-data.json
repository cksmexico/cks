On examination, the affected testicle is usually enlarged (up to four times the normal size), warm, and tender, and the scrotum may be reddened in appearance. It is usually unilateral, and tends to occur about 1 week after symptoms of parotitis. However, it may occur up to 2 weeks after parotitis, and in a significant minority of men there may be no symptoms of parotitis at all.

Most people develop life-long immunity to mumps after one episode, and where reinfection does occur, the illness is usually mild in nature [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/mumps/references/\">Senanayake, 2008</a>].</li><li>Immunization with a single dose of the combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine confers 61–91% protection against mumps [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/mumps/references/\">PHE, 2013a</a>], but immunity decreases with time. A second dose of vaccine increases the level of protection to about 95%, and although some waning of immunity does still occur, protection remains around 85% 6–7 years after the second dose [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/mumps/references/\">Cohen et al, 2007</a>].</li><li>The introduction of the booster measles and rubella (MR) vaccine has resulted in a cohort of children, born between 1981 and 1986, who are more susceptible to mumps infection. Although uptake of the MMR vaccine declined to a low of 79% in 2003 (mainly due to unfounded concern that the measles component of the vaccine was linked to autism and bowel disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/mumps/references/\">Pearce et al, 2008</a>]) only a small proportion of mumps cases have occurred in children eligible for the routine two-dose MMR programme.</li><li>Children aged under 1 year rarely get mumps, as they have usually acquired passive immunity from placental transfer of maternal antibodies [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/mumps/references/\">Litman, 2016</a>].</li></ul><h4>Saliva sample</h4><ul><li><p>Detection of specific IgM in saliva samples (ideally between one and six weeks) after the onset of rash or parotid swelling, has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific for confirmation of mumps.
