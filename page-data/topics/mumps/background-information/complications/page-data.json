This may cause obstruction of lymphatic drainage in the neck, resulting in presternal oedema in about 6% of affected people and (rarely) supraglottic oedema.</li><li>Persistent dilation of the salivary ducts (sialectasia) leading to their chronic inflammation (sialadenitis) has been rarely reported.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Epididymo-orchitis </strong>— the most common complication affecting up to 38% of men. <ul><li>Mumps rarely leads to infertility, but can contribute to sub-fertility. </li><li>Unilateral mumps epididymo-orchitis can significantly, but only transiently, diminish the sperm count, mobility, and morphology. <ul><li>Impairment of fertility is estimated to occur in about 13% of men.</li></ul></li><li>Epididymo-orchitis is bilateral in 15–30% of affected men, and tends to have a worse prognosis.<ul><li>Bilateral mumps epididymo-orchitis causes infertility in 30–87% of affected men.</li></ul></li><li>Of affected testicles, 30–50% show a degree of testicular atrophy. </li><li>Most men recover after 2 weeks, although in about 20% of affected men it may persist for longer.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Encephalitis </strong>— occurs in about 0.1% of people. The presence of seizures, decreased level of consciousness, and focal neurological symptoms indicates mumps encephalitis. Abnormalities in EEG can also be seen and usually resolve in a few weeks. Mortality is 1–5% and long-term morbidity is rare.</li><li><strong>Oophoritis</strong> — reported in about 7% of women with mumps, but rarely causes infertility or premature menopause. </li><li><strong>Aseptic meningitis</strong> — occurs in up to 25% of people with mumps, and is three times more common in males. Mumps meningitis is usually benign, and almost all patients have a complete recovery with no residual neurological deficits and no risk of mortality. </li><li><strong>Transient hearing loss</strong> — affects about 4% of people, but permanent deafness is much less common (about 1 in 20,000 people). Bilateral hearing loss is very rare. </li><li><strong>Myocardial complications</strong> — ECG changes, including ST segment depression, T wave inversion, and prolonged PR intervals, are seen in 15% of mumps infections.<font color=\"#2a6ebb\"> </font>Fatal myocarditis with dilated cardiomyopathy has been reported but is extremely rare. </li><li><strong>Pancreatitis</strong> — affects about 4% of people, but is usually mild. </li><li><strong>Spontaneous abortion</strong> — a study in the 1960s showed increased risk of miscarriage with mumps infection during the first trimester, however a more recent study had no increased rate of miscarriage. </li><li><strong>Rarer complications</strong> of mumps that have been reported include other central nervous system disorders (such as cerebellar ataxia, facial palsy, transverse myelitis, and Guillain–Barre syndrome), thyroiditis, mastitis, prostatitis, hepatitis, and thrombocytopenia.</li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/mumps/references/\">Masarani et al, 2006</a>;
