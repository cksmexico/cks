Other causes include sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and non-infective causes, such as retained foreign body, inflammation due to allergy or irritation, tumours, and cervical ectopy or polyps. The nature and/or volume of normal physiological discharge may also be altered by pregnancy, sexual stimulation, contraceptive use, and age.</li><li>A detailed history should be taken to assess the possible cause of abnormal vaginal discharge and the woman's risk of an STI. Women are considered at increased risk if they are:<ul><li>Younger than 25 years of age, <em>or</em></li><li>Have had a new sexual partner or more than 1 sexual partner in the last 12 months, <em>or </em></li><li>Have had a previous STI.</li></ul></li><li>Examination and investigations are advised for most women, but may be omitted:<ul><li>In women with a history suggestive of physiological discharge.</li><li>For some women presenting with classical symptoms of BV or vaginal candidiasis, depending on their history. </li></ul></li><li>If examination and investigations are warranted, a speculum examination, bimanual palpation, pH testing of vaginal discharge, and swabs (if indicated) should be undertaken.

Vulval satellite lesions of erythema may occur in addition to vaginal erythema.</li><li>Trichomoniasis, when symptomatic, is characterized by a yellow-green, frothy discharge with a fishy odour and a pH higher than 4.5.</li><li>Cervicitis caused by chlamydia or gonorrhoea is characterized by an inflamed cervix which bleeds easily and may be associated with a mucopurulent discharge.</li><li>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) caused by chlamydia or gonorrhoea is characterized by lower abdominal pain, with or without fever. Cervicitis may be seen, and adnexal tenderness and cervical excitation found on bimanual palpation.</li></ul></li><li>Management of abnormal vaginal discharge involves:<ul><li>Considering the need for admission or referral, for example in women with PID who are pregnant (urgent admission); if a gynaecological cancer is suspected (suspected cancer pathway referral); and for partner notification (if there is microbiologically-confirmed gonorrhoea, chlamydia, or trichomoniasis).</li><li>Prescribing appropriate antibiotics for infective causes.</li><li>Managing non-infective causes, where possible.</li><li>Reassuring women with features suggestive of physiological discharge.</li><li>Giving general healthcare advice (such as on personal hygiene).</li><li>Providing sources of additional information.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 645b2cc1-23b1-4b08-83cd-a71dd9480f06 --><!-- end item 5c18b64e-1656-4e7a-a61c-4bd5dde59835 -->","topic":{"id":"c0c94026-372c-5bc7-a90b-df05a4da2509","topicId":"80e0524e-d862-4933-9129-5528a3ae1d32","topicName":"Vaginal discharge","slug":"vaginal-discharge","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"e4e968a7-6f51-523a-8c10-a4aa9ebd5a13","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"df84b7ee-9fe3-5d49-b683-53c3493b7e6e","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"a367d5a3-1321-5e04-8f71-4f2821a2d9b7","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"f463309b-51c2-5ce1-9907-cf36693db062","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"aa3e8cbe-cc26-536c-96b7-47f0a1c44a78","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"5774db95-1920-52a9-90ba-19ccd67a11bd","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"b055685f-bce5-50bc-a2f0-a3d2c7bf5dd3","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"46a90f7d-7c44-53d2-a323-422f4c93060d","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"af1001b8-5e17-58ae-9f97-eb5ca1fe46df","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"209f9a10-6c9e-541e-98f1-5c3b7bf3e651","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"e025673f-cb80-5c81-9fd4-84dd310e1f4b","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
