the guidelines <em>Management and laboratory diagnosis of Abnormal Vaginal Discharge: Quick Reference Guide for Primary Care </em>published by Public Health England (PHE) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vaginal-discharge/references/\">PHE, 2013</a>] and <em>Sexually Transmitted Infections in Primary Care 2013 (RCGP/BASHH) </em>published on behalf of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) and the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vaginal-discharge/references/\">Lazaro, 2013</a>].</p><h4>Taking a detailed history</h4><ul><li>Expert opinion in the RCGP/BASHH guideline is that a careful clinical and sexual history is essential when managing a woman with vaginal discharge because [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vaginal-discharge/references/\">Lazaro, 2013</a>]:<ul><li>Candida is often over-diagnosed (by women and clinicians).</li><li>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is often under-diagnosed (even though it is more common than candida).</li><li>Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) may be missed if a sensitive sexual history is not taken. </li></ul></li><li>The recommended questions to ask are based on expert opinion in the RCGP/BASHH guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vaginal-discharge/references/\">Lazaro, 2013</a>], the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <em>Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2015 </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vaginal-discharge/references/\">CDC, 2015</a>], and review articles on vaginal discharge [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vaginal-discharge/references/\">Spence, 2007</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vaginal-discharge/references/\">Fahami, 2013</a>].</li><li>The information on when a woman is considered at high-risk of an STI is based on expert opinion in the PHE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vaginal-discharge/references/\">PHE, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h4>Examination and investigations</h4><ul><li>The recommendation to consider referring women at high risk of a STI or with characteristic features of trichomoniasis, cervicitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) to a genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinic is based on expert opinion in the PHE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vaginal-discharge/references/\">PHE, 2013</a>] and the RCGP/BASHH guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vaginal-discharge/references/\">Lazaro, 2013</a>]. <ul><li><em>Chlamydia trachomatis </em>and<em> </em><em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae </em>are cervical organisms, and the infection may remain localized causing cervicitis, or ascend to the upper genital tract causing PID.</li><li>Trichomoniasis is difficult to diagnose in primary care (and should always be treated in the GUM clinic). </li><li>Referral to GUM clinic will facilitate screening for infections and partner notification (which is required for anyone with microbiologically confirmed gonorrhoea, chlamydia, or trichomoniasis).</li></ul></li><li>Expert opinion in the RCGP/BASHH guideline is that examination is not always needed in women with uncomplicated vaginal discharge. However [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vaginal-discharge/references/\">Lazaro, 2013</a>]:<ul><li>The prescriber should take a thorough history and not simply rely on the woman’s self-diagnosis.</li><li>Women with recurrent symptoms or those who fail to improve should be examined and investigated.</li><li>Certain conditions should prompt an appropriate examination and investigations first line.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendations on when examination may be omitted (and empirical treatment started, as appropriate) is based on the PHE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vaginal-discharge/references/\">PHE, 2013</a>], which states that:<ul><li>For women with diagnosed BV, microscopy and culture are not required.</li><li>For women with diagnosed vaginal candidiasis, culture is not needed unless recurrent.</li><li>Women of reproductive age with vaginal discharge should have a high vaginal swab taken for culture if:<ul><li>They are postnatal or post miscarriage.</li><li>They have vaginitis without discharge.</li><li>They are pre or post gynaecological surgery.</li><li>They are pre or post termination of pregnancy.</li><li>Symptoms are not characteristic of BV.</li><li>Within 3 weeks of intrauterine contraceptive insertion.</li><li>The condition is recurrent (4 cases a year or more).</li><li>A previous treatment failed.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 0cbfc9d0-4d2b-4fc4-bba7-d87984a61f05 --><!-- end item ed967168-103a-4f86-8020-71a86d2a3b72 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
