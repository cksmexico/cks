fear of gaining weight.</li><li>Changes in behaviour may be noticed for example becoming increasingly selective about food, avoiding eating with others, saying they aren't hungry, that they have already eaten, or refusing food they used to enjoy.</li><li>Other behaviours may include repeated weighing, measuring and checking in the mirror.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Behaviour that interferes with weight gain.</strong><ul><li>Compensatory behaviours such as self-induced purging (by vomiting or misuse of laxatives), excessive exercise, and use of appetite suppressant medication or diuretics may be present.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Psychological disturbance which may include.</strong><ul><li>Distortion of body image, with a dread of being overweight.</li><li>Low self-esteem and a drive for perfection.</li><li>Over-evaluation of self-worth in terms of body weight and shape.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Denial of seriousness of malnutrition and its impact on physical health.</strong><ul><li>Many people with anorexia nervosa have difficulty acknowledging there is a problem, do not consider themselves to be ill and may be ambivalent about change.</li><li>In others, there may be secrecy about the symptoms, for example hiding weight loss.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Hormonal disturbance.</strong><ul><li>Females with anorexia nervosa may present with amenorrhoea or other menstrual irregularities.</li><li>Hormonal disturbance is a common feature of anorexia nervosa but amenorrhea is no longer in the criteria for diagnosis in females and is only one of a number of markers of hormonal insufficiency due to low weight.</li><li>Males with anorexia nervosa may present with loss of libido and potency.</li><li>In children, onset of puberty, growth and physical development can be affected.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Many physical signs are associated with anorexia</strong> <strong>nervosa</strong> including dry skin, hair loss, bradycardia, orthostatic hypotension, hypothermia, loss of muscle strength, oedema, constipation, fainting, dizziness, and fatigue.<ul><li>For more information, see the section on <a class=\"topic-reference
