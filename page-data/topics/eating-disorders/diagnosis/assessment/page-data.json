by drinking large amounts of water beforehand or by hiding heavy objects in their clothes.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Check vital signs including:</strong><ul><li>Temperature (hypothermia is a red flag).</li><li>Pulse (bradycardia for example <50 beats per minute or postural tachycardia are red flags).</li><li>Blood pressure checking for postural differences (hypotension or orthostatic hypotension are red flags).</li><li>Hydrations state.</li><li>Peripheral circulation.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Look for muscle wasting and assess muscle strength:</strong><ul><li>Scores of 2 or less (especially if scores are falling) on the Sit up–Squat–Stand (SUSS) test are a red flag.<ul><li>The sit up test — the person lies flat on a firm surface such as the floor and has to sit up without, if possible, using their hands.</li><li>The squat test — the person is asked to rise from a squatting position without, if possible, using their hands.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Carry out a

people with an eating disorder will have normal blood results which are a poor indicator of risk, however, some tests may be useful to rule out complications.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Depending on clinical situation, consider the following investigations in primary care  (seeking specialist advice or </strong><a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/eating-disorders/management/suspected-eating-disorder/#admission\">admitting to hospital</a> <strong> may be more appropriate):</strong><ul><li>Full blood count — may show anaemia from malnutrition or gastrointestinal losses, or mild leucopenia or thrombocytopenia from malnutrition.</li><li>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) — usually normal in people with anorexia, a raised ESR may indicate an organic cause of weight loss.</li><li>Urea and electrolytes — hypokalaemia is suggestive of vomiting or laxative abuse; hyponatraemia may be a result of excess water intake. Electrolytes may be elevated due to dehydration.</li><li>Liver function tests — may be slightly elevated from malnutrition.</li><li>Blood glucose.</li><li>Creatinine, and urinalysis — chronic hypokalaemia and chronic volume depletion can lead to the development of kidney disease.</li><li>Electrocardiography (ECG) — this should be considered for all people with rapid weight loss, excessive exercise, severe purging behaviours (such as laxative or diuretic use or vomiting), bradycardia, hypotension, excessive caffeine (including from energy drinks), prescribed or non-prescribed medications, muscle weakness, electrolyte imbalance, or previous abnormal heart rhythm.</li></ul></li><li>Further tests may be required in more severe cases or to assess complications (seek specialist advice):<ul><li>Calcium, magnesium, phosphate.</li><li>B12, folate and ferritin.</li><li>Thyroid function tests.</li><li>Follicle stimulating hormone, luteinising hormone, oestradiol, prolactin and urinalysis (including pregnancy test) may be considered if presenting with amenorrhoea.</li></ul></li><li>Other investigations may be indicated if an <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\"

specialist advice (for example on the need for admission) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/eating-disorders/references/\">Royal College of Psychiatrists,
