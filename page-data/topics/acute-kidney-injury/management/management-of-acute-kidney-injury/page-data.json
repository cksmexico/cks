The KDIGO guideline states that although it may not be possible to determine the cause, and identifying a cause may not always suggest a specific treatment, it is important to look so that people with certain diseases which can respond to a specific treatment can be identified [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes, 2012</a>].</li><li>The advice on what questions to ask to identify a cause is extrapolated from the Think Kidneys documents <em>Communities at risk of developing acute kidney injury </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2015</a>], <em>Best practice guidance.

Quick reference guide</em><strong> </strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2017</a>]. CKS also derived this recommendation from expert opinion on the causes of AKI discussed in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Thornburg and Gray-Vickrey, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Makris and Spanou, 2016</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Urinalysis</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the consensus of the NICE guideline development group (GDG) as evidence was lacking. The aim of dipstick testing is to detect treatable conditions such as glomerulonephritis, acute pyelonephritis, and interstitial nephritis. The GDG also discussed the possibility of false positive results in people with catheters (for example microscopic haematuria from traumatic catheter insertion) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>].</li><li>The information on interpretation of urine dipstick results reflects the opinion of NICE [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>], Think Kidneys [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016a</a>], and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Larmour and Maxwell, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Ostermann, 2016</a>].</li></ul><h5>Staging</h5><ul><li>It is important to stage an episode of AKI because as the stage increases, so does the severity and the risk of adverse outcomes and the need for renal replacement therapy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016a</a>], therefore staging can help to guide management. The advice to stage AKI according to the criterion which shows the most severe stage is based on the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes clinical practice guideline on acute kidney injury [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes, 2012</a>] and expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Prescott et al, 2012</a>].  </li><li>The NICE GDG were of the opinion that using a system to stage AKI was beneficial but the evidence was not sufficient for a recommendation on using a specific staging system to be made.

CKS, therefore, was of the opinion it is reasonable to provide a simplified version, amalgamating criteria from the three main staging systems and has based its recommendation on staging on summaries from NICE [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>]<strong> </strong>and Think Kidneys <em>Best practice guidance.

However, the NICE guideline development group (GDG) felt that clinical judgement would be required by primary healthcare practitioners when deciding whether admission is necessary. The GDG were also of the opinion that earlier specialist intervention could lead to better care and lower mortality [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>].</li><li>The recommendation for people with likely stage 3 kidney injury is based on the Think Kidneys document <em>Best practice guidance: Responding to AKI warning stage test results for adults in primary care</em>. This recommends that if there is a high pre-test probability of stage 3 AKI (for example in the context of acute illness), immediate admission should be considered [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016a</a>]. </li><li>The NICE GDG recommends that if pyonephrosis (infected and obstructed kidney) is suspected, immediate ultrasound of the urinary tract (within 6 hours) should be performed. It also recommends urgent ultrasound (within 24 hours of assessment) for people who have no identified cause for their acute kidney injury or are at risk of urinary tract obstruction. The GDG were of the opinion that this timescale should avoid delay in identifying treatable obstruction and that when weighing up the costs of misdiagnosing obstruction (such as permanent renal damage or the need for renal replacement) it should be cost-effective to recommend ultrasound for people at high risk of obstruction [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>]. This is consistent with recommendations from Think Kidneys [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016c</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to admit a person with sepsis or a need for intravenous fluid replacement and monitoring is based on a Think Kidneys best practice guidance for primary care [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016a</a>] and an approach to the management of AKI from the Improvement Academy and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Improvement Academy and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, 2015</a>].  </li><li>CKS has extrapolated the statement about admitting people with a deterioration in clinical condition from expert opinion in the NICE guideline which advises close monitoring and observation in this group [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>], because this intensity of care may not be available in a primary care setting.</li><li>Admission of people with complications of AKI has been suggested by CKS based on extrapolation from the NICE criteria for when renal replacement therapy should be considered [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">NICE, 2013b</a>]; Think Kidneys guidance for primary healthcare professionals [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016a</a>]; and expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Levey and James, 2017</a>].  </li></ul><h5>Discussion with a nephrologist</h5><ul><li>No data were found to support a recommendation on when a nephrologist should be consulted; therefore the NICE GDG used their clinical experience to compile a list of clinical circumstances for which people with AKI should be referred to nephrology services. These include people with potentially treatable disease and/or an increased risk of progression of their acute kidney injury and adverse outcomes. The time frame suggested was based on the expert opinion of the GDG [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>].</li><li>In terms of which people shoud be discussed with a nephrologist, recommendations are largely supported by the Think Kidneys guidance for primary healthcare professionals [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016a</a>] and the Improvement Academy and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination 'Effectiveness matters' summary [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Improvement Academy and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, 2015</a>], and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Larmour and Maxwell, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Levey and James, 2017</a>].  </li></ul><h5>Stage 2 AKI</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is pragmatic. CKS found no specific mention in the NICE guideline of the primary care management of people with stage 2 AKI. However, the KDIGO guideline has an algorithm for the stage-based management of AKI which suggests that some people with stage 2 AKI may require an invasive diagnostic work up and possibly admission for intensive care and renal replacement therapy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes, 2012</a>]. As these interventions are not available in primary care it seems prudent to discuss with a medical specialist if there is uncertainty about the cause or management.</li><li>The NICE GDG acknowledged that rapid referral to acute nephrology services of in-patients with stage 2 to stage 3 acute kidney injury not needing critical care may result in earlier detection of primary renal disease, timely treatment, and a reduction in the risk of progressive AKI, but noted a need for further research on rapid referral to nephrology services for these groups. CKS has extrapolated these comments for a primary care population and recommended discussion wih a nephrologist, if available [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>] </li></ul><h5>Stage 1 AKI</h5><ul><li>The NICE GDG states that 'the majority of patients with acute kidney injury require management which can be delivered by a competent clinical team in primary or secondary care without the need for specialist input. This includes correction of volume status, correction of hypotension and avoidance of nephrotoxins followed by regular monitoring'. The GDG acknowledges that stage 1 AKI is very common during acute illness and small rises in creatinine often improve in line with recovery from the underlying condition and competent clinical management. Because of this, and because the large numbers of people with stage 1 AKI would overwhelm specialist services, it was the opinion of the GDG that routine referral to nephrology is not necessary for all people with stage 1 AKI (although there are exceptions) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h5>Management according to cause</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is pragmatic and based on a statement from KDIGO that 'patients should always be managed according to the cause of their disease' [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes, 2012</a>]. CKS accepts that clinical judgement will be required in deciding whether management of a particular condition is within the scope of a practitioner's expertise, and acknowledges that acute kidney injury will frequently need to be managed in secondary care for confirmation of the underlying cause or management of complications.</li></ul><h5>Supportive measures</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is pragmatic and based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice. Guidance from Think Kidneys, aimed at primary healthcare practitioners, emphasises the importance of assessment of volume status (fluid intake and fluid losses) and considering the need for admission to hospital for intravenous fluid replacement and monitoring [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016a</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Consider stopping potentially nephrotoxic medication and adjusting doses of regular medication</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on expert opinion in guidelines from KDIGO [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes, 2012</a>] and the opinion of the NICE GDG [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>] and takes into account guidance on medicines management from Think Kidneys [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016c</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016d</a>].<ul><li>NICE identified no relevant clinical studies which compared stopping angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) or angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs) with continuing treatment in people with diarrhoea and vomiting or sepsis, and were unable to estimate the cost implications of stopping treatment as no economic evidence was found. However, for these people, the GDG consensus was that the risks were lower with temporarily stopping ACE inhibitors or ARBs compared with continuing. They concluded that there is a clear association with continuing the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and AKI, but the temporary suspension of these drugs was felt to be unlikely to greatly increase the risk of cardiovascular events [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>].</li><li>NICE did not specifically make recommendations or discuss the management of other nephrotoxic drugs in detail, but the Think Kidneys documents <em>Acute kidney injury: potentially problematic drugs and actions to take in primary care </em>and <em>Guidelines for medicines optimisation in patients with acute kidney injury </em>provide guidance for prescribers [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016c</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016d</a>]. CKS has pragmatically made the recommendation to seek specialist advice if unsure based on what it considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Regular monitoring</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on expert opinion from the NICE GDG, who felt that primary care clinicians would need to use clinical judgement to determine the frequency of any monitoring. They were of the opinion that daily measurement of serum creatinine levels was common practice in acutely unwell people (although this applied to a hospital population) and that harm is more likely from <em>not </em>requesting measurement of renal function [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>].</li><li>The NICE GDG emphasized the importance of an awareness that modest rises in creatinine (even at the level of stage 1 AKI) are associated with increased mortality [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h5>Reconsidering admission or seeking specialist advice</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is extrapolated from the opinion of the NICE GDG who agreed that as acute kidney injury advances in severity, there should be an increasingly lower threshold for referral [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field 3dcd00b4-8ed4-4241-8da7-2fda197fe6c1 --><!-- end item ea044c3c-4938-4328-8678-548379d61863 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"3ad30018-479f-5cb9-bc7c-42c935daac0b","slug":"follow-up","fullItemName":"Follow up","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 98bc6fa9-8fb4-4679-b9f6-8cfd73471e80 --><h3>How should I follow up a person after an episode of acute kidney injury?</h3><!-- end field 98bc6fa9-8fb4-4679-b9f6-8cfd73471e80 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 9f7ff563-8b5e-444f-996c-46652c0fd539 --><!-- begin field fdddead0-d816-4f22-97e1-6c48fa75c8de --><ul><li>Following an episode of acute kidney injury (AKI), care should become focused on monitoring and prevention of further episodes.

People with acute kidney injury who already have chronic kidney disease do not have much renal reserve and are therefore at particular risk from acute kidney injury. The GDG felt that nephrologists have the expertise to manage this group of people by stabilizing renal function, and preventing further acute kidney injury episodes and advancement to end-stage renal disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Monitoring serum creatinine and referral to a nephrologist</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on a consensus decision by the NICE GDG that monitoring of renal function once a person has recovered from an episode of acute kidney injury is very important. They state that a clear plan for early monitoring should be made by the hospital clinical team based on clinical judgement, reflecting the stability and degree of renal dysfunction, and that this should be communicated to primary care in the discharge letter [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>]. The Think Kidneys document <em>Best practice guidance.

Even with mild residual renal impairment, follow up (including GFR and blood pressure measurement and urinalysis) is important in most cases [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Documenting episodes of acute kidney injury</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Prescott et al, 2012</a>].</li></ul><h5>Reviewing the need for medication stopped during the AKI episode</h5><ul><li>The Think Kidneys document <em>Best practice guidance.
