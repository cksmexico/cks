NICE mention risk assessment tools for AKI but acknowledge that these are more established in specific secondary care settings.</li><li>The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline acknowledges that risk assessment for community-acquired AKI differs from that of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury because of more limited opportunity to offer intervention prior to exposure to acute kidney injury [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes, 2012</a>].</li></ul><h5>Monitoring serum creatinine in people at risk</h5><ul><li>The NICE GDG recommended the regular monitoring of people at risk of acute kidney injury, but was unable to define the frequency of monitoring because it was of the view that this would vary depending on the clinical circumstances [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>]. CKS has therefore made pragmatic recommendations on the basis of what it considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><h5>Discuss risk of developing acute kidney injury</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is largely based on the NICE guideline on AKI [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">NICE, 2013b</a>].  Information provision was considered by the NICE GDG as likely to be beneficial and unlikely to cause harm, although the potential to cause anxiety was discussed. The NICE GDG specifically mentioned nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as these are the only potentially nephrotoxic medications available over the counter [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>] and drugs affecting the blood pressure were included based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Levey and James, 2017</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Medication review</h5><ul><li>Medication review is suggested on the basis of expert opinion in a review article on early intervention to improve outcomes in AKI<strong> </strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Larmour and Maxwell, 2015</a>] and a British Journal of General Practice editorial on AKI in primary care [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Tollitt et al, 2017</a>]. </li><li>An important factor in reducing the future risk of AKI is thoughtful prescribing in the community. Experts note the risks of individual drugs, but also discuss the potentially nephrotoxic effect of combinations, such as NSAIDs with an ACEI or ARB [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Larmour and Maxwell, 2015</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Seeking medical advice in the event of acute illness to discuss temporarily stopping medications</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is largely based on the NICE guideline on AKI [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">NICE, 2013b</a>] and expert opinion in a subsequent primary care-orientated review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Mesropian et al, 2016</a>]. Other experts also recommend that it may be necessary to stop some medications in people at risk of AKI in certain situations and some advise educating patients about 'sick day' rules, including stopping potentially nephrotoxic drugs during episodes of acute illness [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Larmour and Maxwell, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Tollitt et al, 2017</a>]. This is because people with a dehydrating illness (for example gastroenteritis) are at risk of hypotension, which is further exacerbated by certain drugs [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Improvement Academy and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, 2015</a>]. However a position statement from Think Kidneys noted potential harms associated with 'sick day' rules and people managing and stopping their regular medication, especially when there has not been a clinical assessment. Possible problems include decompensated heart failure, poorly controlled hypertension or diabetes, and failure to restart medication after the acute illness [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Tollitt et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2018</a>]. CKS has therefore recommended the person should be instructed to seek medical advice in the event of acute illness so advice on medication changes can be based on an appropriate assessment<strong>. </strong>This approach is consistent with expert opinion advising that medicines management in the community should involve discussion with the person's GP<strong> </strong>in a review from the Improvement Academy and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Improvement Academy and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, 2015</a>]<strong> </strong>and a review article discussing the challenges of AKI in primary care [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Mesropian et al, 2016</a>]. </li><li>The medications included in this recommendation are based on the expert opinion of the<strong> </strong>NICE GDG<strong> </strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>] and expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Levey and James, 2017</a>]. The NICE GDG identified no relevant clinical studies which compared stopping angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) with continuing treatment in people with diarrhoea and vomiting or sepsis. However, for these people, the GDG consensus was that the risks were lower with temporarily stopping ACE inhibitors compared with continuing. They concluded that there is a clear association with continuing the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs and AKI, but the temporary suspension of these drugs was felt to be unlikely to greatly increase the risk of cardiovascular events [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h5>Seeking advice from a pharmacist</h5><ul><li>The NICE GDG identified no evidence on pharmacist review for the prevention of acute kidney injury, but based this recommendation on their clinical experience and felt that there would be no clinical harm from pharmacist review. The aim of this intervention is to ensure safe prescribing in order to reduce complications from nephrotoxic drugs in people at risk of acute kidney injury [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Offering written information</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is pragmatic and based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice. The suggested leaflet was developed in collaboration with the Royal College of General Practitioners and Think Kidneys. </li></ul><h5>Admission of people with hypovolaemia in people with acute illness</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to consider admission of people with hypovolaemia for intravenous fluid therapy is based on consensus expert opinion in the Think Kidneys <em>Best practice guidance: Responding to AKI warning stage test results for adults in primary care</em>. This document emphasises the importance of considering a person's volume status and deciding whether admission for intravenous fluid replacement and monitoring is required [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016a</a>].  </li></ul><!-- end field 9d4382de-e05f-41ef-8a57-386314b09cdd --><!-- end item 84a6e4c2-5930-4ca8-9266-57108a150fe3 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
