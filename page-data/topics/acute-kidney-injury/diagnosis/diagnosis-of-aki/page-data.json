injury</h4><ul><li>CKS has based its approach to the diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) largely on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline <em>Acute kidney injury: prevention, detection and management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">NICE, 2013b</a>].</li><li>Think Kidneys, a national programme led by NHS England in partnership with the UK Renal Registry, emphasises the importance of interpreting test results taking into account clinical circumstances [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2017</a>]. This is consistent with expert opinion in a review article which states that clinical judgement is required to make the diagnosis of AKI as the clinical situation, underlying cause, and factors affecting the performance of the definition of AKI need to be considered [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Selby et al, 2016</a>].</li></ul><h4>Measurement of serum creatinine</h4><ul><li>NICE recommends measuring serum creatinine and comparing with baseline in adults with acute illness and a risk factor for acute kidney injury [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">NICE, 2013b</a>].</li><li>The methods of assessing baseline values for creatinine values available from the past year are consistent with those suggested in the NICE full guideline on acute kidney injury [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>] and Think Kidneys in their best practice guidance for primary care [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016a</a>]. In the NICE guideline, a method of calculating a baseline creatinine when a creatinine result is not available is discussed but this has limitations and CKS is of the opinion that its use is not practical for a primary care setting. Therefore in this situation CKS has based its recommendations on consensus expert opinion in <em>Best practice guidance. Responding to AKI warning stage test results for adults in primary care</em> which advises repeating the creatinine level within 48–72 hours to ascertain whether there is a further increase, or the changes are stable and more indicative of chronic kidney disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016a</a>]. </li><li>Expert opinion from previous reviewers of this CKS topic emphasises the need for close monitoring and clinical judgement regarding a person's clinical state and creatinine level. </li></ul><h4>Factors to take into consideration which may affect test results</h4><ul><li>This recommendation is based on consensus expert opinion from Think Kidneys, in a primary care best practice guidance, that explains situations in which false positive results for AKI may be encountered [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016a</a>].</li></ul><h4>Detection of acute kidney injury</h4><ul><li>There is a lack of a gold standard diagnostic test for AKI and NICE identified no specific evidence for a primary care setting.<ul><li>The RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss and End stage renal disease) criteria were developed by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative group in 2004. They were followed in 2007 by the AKIN criteria from the Acute Kidney Injury Network, which built on the RIFLE definition. However, it is accepted that both of these classifications have limitations, and more recently, the International Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline simplified and merged the two previous definitions [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>].</li><li>In making recommendations, NICE has considered all these criteria and acknowledges the need for a standardized definition of AKI [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>]. The NICE detection criteria are supported by subsequent guidance for primary care from Think Kidneys [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016a</a>]. </li></ul></li><li>In response to expert feedback from previous reviewers of this CKS topic, text has been added to raise awareness of the possibility of missing the diagnosis of well-established AKI with a high creatinine level if the rise in serum creatinine level over 48 hours is less than 26 micromol/L.</li><li>The NICE guideline development group acknowledges that because detection of oliguria is difficult in primary care, practitioners will rely on creatinine changes to detect AKI (and should be aware that small increases in creatinine indicate deterioration in the person's condition) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>]. However CKS has included the criteria for detection based on oliguria as information on urine output may be available for people who already have catheters in primary care, although a Think Kidneys position statement noted that urinary catheterisation to measure hourly urine output should not routinely be used as part of diagnosis of AKI unless in a critical care setting [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016b</a>]. </li><li>NICE also discussed the limitations of detection in primary care as primary healthcare professionals may have less information on which to base a judgement due to less frequent monitoring of renal function [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h4>Doubt about test results in people with chronic kidney disease</h4><ul><li>The recommendation to treat people with chronic kidney disease as acute-on-chronic if there is a clinical deterioration and there is doubt as to whether the changes are acute or chronic is based on the opinion of the NICE GDG. This states that it can be difficult to distinguish between acute-on-chronic kidney disease<em> </em>and progressive kidney disease and there is little harm if a person with progressive chronic kidney disease is falsely diagnosed as having acute-on-chronic kidney disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field cc529317-40fd-4446-99e4-4cd65fb5993e --><!-- end item 39ce61d3-6116-4fd8-8631-312ec325deab -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
