Even when symptoms and signs develop they are often very non-specific [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Firth, 2010</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Thornburg and Gray-Vickrey, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Levey and James, 2017</a>]. Expert reviewers of this CKS topic are of the opinion that the symptoms in acute kidney injury are usually related to the underlying cause(s), rather than the acute kidney injury itself.</li></ul><h4>Acute illness in people with risk factors</h4><ul><li>NICE recommends investigating people with acute illness who are considered to be at increased risk of acute kidney injury based on risk factors (which were extrapolated from tools developed in hospital populations and the clinical experience of the guideline development group). No published validated scores to predict acute kidney injury in primary care were identified. However, the NICE guideline development group consensus was that these risk factors were equally applicable to acutely unwell people in primary care [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2015</a>]. </li><li>CKS has also added cancer and cancer therapy, immunocompromise, and toxins as risk factors that should increase suspicion of AKI in a person with acute illness in line with subsequent expert opinion from Think Kidneys [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2017</a>] and review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Larmour and Maxwell, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Mesropian et al, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Levey and James, 2017</a>].</li></ul><h4>People with illness with no clear acute component (including symptoms suggestive of complications)</h4><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the NICE guideline <em>Acute kidney injury: prevention, detection and management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">NICE, 2013b</a>]. The NICE GDG were of the opinion that early consideration of AKI with illness with no clear acute component may prevent a delay in treatment and improve outcomes and is unlikely to cause harm. The GDG thought that it was important to increase awareness of the potential for AKI in circumstances that may be more common in a primary care setting [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h4>Acute kidney injury warning stage test result</h4><ul><li>The information on AKI warning stage test results to help identify people with AKI at an earlier stage is based on expert consensus opinion in a best practice guideline for primary care [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016a</a>].<strong> </strong>A British Journal of General Practice editorial<strong> </strong>also<strong> </strong>discussed the NHS England mandate for all UK NHS Trusts to implement into their laboratories the NHS AKI scoring algorithm [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Tollitt et al, 2017</a>].<strong> </strong>Although evidence for use of e-alerts in primary care is lacking, implementation for inpatients has had positive results in terms of timely medication review and management interventions, and reduction in mortality<strong> </strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Emmett et al, 2017</a>]. <ul><li>CKS has recommended these alerts are used to suspect rather than diagnose AKI because it is a clinical diagnosis and AKI alerts are not a substitute for inspection and comparison of the person's serum creatinine measurements [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Think Kidneys, 2016a</a>]. In addition, the reduced frequency of phlebotomy in primary compared with secondary care increases the risk of misclassification of results as the median of the last year's creatinine values may be used as a baseline in a large proportion of primary care patients for whom a previous result within 7 days is not available [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Emmett et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Tollitt et al, 2017</a>].  </li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field fca91f9c-2bd9-4626-a9f4-a2f0f1b39759 --><!-- end item 3220c6aa-e50a-49dc-bc9b-958f428d1842 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
