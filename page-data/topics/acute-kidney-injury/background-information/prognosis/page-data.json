A UK hospital-based study reported an overall mortality of 23.8% (16.1% for stage 1, 36.1% for stage 3) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Selby et al, 2012</a>]. A subsequent Welsh prospective cohort study found a 90-day mortality rate of 25.6% and noted an association between peak AKI stage and mortality [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Holmes et al, 2016</a>].  </li><li>AKI acquired in the community has a lower mortality rate than hospital acquired AKI [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Holmes et al, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Tollitt et al, 2017</a>], but is still associated with increased morbidity and mortality. A UK epidemiological study followed up people with hospital-acquired and community-acquired AKI over 14 months since their AKI episode. Overall mortality during this period was found to be 45% for people with community-acquired AKI who were admitted to hospital, of which nearly half of deaths occurred during hospitalisation. This was less than the 63% mortality for the hospital-acquired AKI group, of which 68% of deaths occurred in hospital. Around 40% of both the community- and hospital-acquired groups developed chronic kidney disease within the 14 month follow-up period [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Wonnacott et al, 2014</a>].  </li><li>A systematic review studying long-term prognosis after AKI found that in people with chronic kidney disease preceding the episode of AKI there was a four- to five-fold increase in renal outcomes and mortality outcomes were doubled compared with people with AKI alone [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/acute-kidney-injury/references/\">Sawhney et al, 2015</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 355631fe-32bc-4a05-a9f0-3ea7e5da528a --><!-- end item 01c7f81d-230f-4800-bb9f-08fde9bcacb9 -->","topic":{"id":"cae5beb7-c0ca-5f6d-bcb5-8cca86dedd25","topicId":"56b8a352-d995-4d6a-a707-075a4ffa0f2a","topicName":"Acute kidney injury","slug":"acute-kidney-injury","lastRevised":"Last revised in April 2018","chapters":[{"id":"1638c109-9cc4-5db0-a337-6fdde59c80d2","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"3ea562a4-e93d-530b-9d53-04053874825d","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"c3157b3d-9d92-5308-86ed-01cc1a546feb","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"cb96a0c4-4c77-5f97-904a-9be041f68947","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"7753d3b5-a709-532a-b740-1d598f3a941d","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"b01065ae-f575-5607-baf7-99d035f0b822","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"e583b5a3-9f07-506b-8540-bbc592d0a356","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"f5bb083d-6f65-579b-8552-d3f413274e21","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"23f1ddfa-e893-50fd-80be-490dfd5104c8","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"87204e63-b1ff-5823-9694-bf387a8d1cf8","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"43cb77f8-b906-5fb2-8927-04dcb0506d0d","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
