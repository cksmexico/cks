They are dose dependent and are therefore readily reversible on reducing the dose of (or withdrawing treatment with) the drug.</li><li>Type B reactions (idiosyncratic/bizarre) cannot be predicted from the known pharmacology of the drug.</li><li>Type A adverse reactions are more common than Type B reactions and account for more than 80% of all reactions. </li></ul></li><li>The health and financial implications of ADRs are significant: about 6–7% of hospital admissions in the UK are due to ADRs.</li><li>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) are responsible for monitoring the safety of all medicines marketed in the UK, through the process of pharmacovigilance.<ul><li>Spontaneous ADR reporting schemes (such as the Yellow Card Scheme) are important information sources for pharmacovigilance.</li><li>Data from the Yellow Card Scheme underpins the process of pharmacovigilance in the UK. </li></ul></li><li>Yellow Card reports should be made for all suspected ADRs in adults and children that are:<ul><li>Serious, medically significant, or result in harm.</li><li>Associated with Black Triangle products, including suspected ADRs considered not to be serious.</li></ul></li><li>Yellow Card reports can be made for:<ul><li>Suspected ADRs to all medicines, including vaccines, blood factors and immunoglobulins, and complementary medicines. </li><li>All medical devices available on the UK market.</li><li>Defective medicines (those that are not of an acceptable quality).</li><li>Fake or counterfeit medicines or medical devices.</li><li>Nicotine-containing electronic cigarettes and refill containers (e-liquids).</li></ul></li><li>The MHRA are particularly interested in receiving Yellow Card reports of suspected ADRs:<ul><li>In children. </li><li>In people aged over 65 years.</li><li>To biological medicines and vaccines.</li><li>Associated with delayed drug effects and interactions.</li><li>On congenital abnormalities.</li><li>To complementary remedies.</li></ul></li><li>It is not necessary to be certain that an ADR has occurred before submitting a report.</li><li>A Yellow Card can be submitted:<ul><li>Via the MHRA Yellow Card website (www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard). </li><li>Via a free Yellow Card mobile app.  </li><li>By post.
