For example, the liver and kidneys in a child may not have fully developed and may affect how the child metabolizes and excretes the medicine compared with an adult.</li><li>Many drugs that are routinely used to treat children have not been extensively tested in children; many are not licensed for use in children and are used off-label. </li><li>Medicines may affect the way a child grows and develops or may cause delayed adverse reactions which do not occur in adults.</li><li>Available formulations may not allow precise dosing in children or they may contain excipients that should not be used in children, such as alcohol.</li><li>The nature and course of illnesses and suspected ADRs may differ between adults and children, for example otitis media and treatment of chronic cough in children.</li></ul></li><li><strong>People aged over 65 years of ag</strong><strong>e, because:</strong><ul><li>Elderly people may be more susceptible to developing ADRs as they may metabolize or excrete drugs less effectively and may be more sensitive to their effects.</li><li>For both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic reasons, they may be more susceptible to developing reactions.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Biological medicines (such as blood products, antibodies and advanced therapies [such as gene and tissue therapy]) and vaccines</strong><strong>, </strong>because:<ul><li>A variety of biological medicines and vaccines are fundamentally different from standard chemical medicines in terms of their complexity, and the characteristics of such products won’t be identical.</li><li>It is therefore very important that surveillance is carried out on a brand/product-specific basis, which may vary from batch-to-batch.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Drug interactions:</strong><ul><li>Some precipitant drugs (the drug causing the interaction) can alter the pharmacokinteics of object drugs (the drug affected by the interaction) by altering the absorption, distribution metabolism, or excretion of the object drug.</li><li>Some drugs have pharmacodynamic interactions and can change the response of one or multiple drugs, having an additive or antagonistic effect. Either type of drug interactions can result in ADRs in some people, and the frequency of drug-drug interactions can increase with the number of medications the person is taking.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Rare or delayed drug effects, </strong>because:<ul><li>These reactions may appear months or years after exposure (for example cancers or retroperitoneal fibrosis).</li><li>They are not likely to be identified in short-term clinical studies and may become apparent only after extensive and long-term use of the drug.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Congenital anomalies, </strong>because:<ul><li>Information on these adverse reactions is very limited, given that clinical trials do not generally involve pregnant women.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Herbal remedies, </strong>because:<ul><li>Although some herbal medicines are licensed for use, many unlicensed herbal remedies are available from outlets other than pharmacies (or are supplied by herbal practitioners).</li><li>It is important for the MHRA to monitor all herbal products to ensure their safety.
