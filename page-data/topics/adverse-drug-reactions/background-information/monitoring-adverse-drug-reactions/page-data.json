It is therefore vital that the safety of all medicines is monitored throughout their marketed life, through a process known as pharmacovigilance.</li><li>Pharmacovigilance is the process of [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/adverse-drug-reactions/references/\">MHRA, 2015c</a>]:<ul><li>Monitoring the use of medicines in everyday practice to identify previously unrecognized adverse effects or changes in the patterns of adverse effects.</li><li>Assessing the risks and benefits of medicines to determine what action, if any, is necessary or needed to improve their safe use.</li><li>Providing information to health care professionals and patients to optimize safe and effective use of medicines.</li><li>Monitoring the effect of any action taken.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Spontaneous ADR reporting schemes are important information sources for pharmacovigilance.</strong><ul><li>The UK's spontaneous ADR reporting scheme, called the <a data-hyperlink-id=\"95ba1d40-21a8-4659-8a22-a9920182a703\" href=\"https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/\">Yellow Card Scheme</a>, is run by the MHRA and the CHM.<ul><li>The Yellow Card Scheme receives voluntary reports of suspected ADRs from health professionals and members of the public [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/adverse-drug-reactions/references/\">Independent Steering Committee, 2004</a>].</li><li>The scheme assists in alerting the MHRA and CHM to new signals (or potential safety concerns), such as previously unrecognized ADRs or ADRs related to a specific drug. It also helps to confirm a signal of an ADR with limited information from an alternative data source, such as the literature or post-marketing studies, and also in evaluating comparative risks of related drugs.</li><li>Information collected through the Yellow Card Scheme is vital in helping the MHRA and CHM monitor medicine safety.

Other data sources regularly used in the monitoring of drug safety in the UK include clinical and epidemiological studies, worldwide published medical literature, pharmaceutical companies, worldwide regulatory authorities, and morbidity and mortality databases.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Pharmacovigilance and reporting of ADRs are important </strong><strong>because the information collected during the pre-marketing phase of drug development is inevitably incomplete with regard to possible ADRs.</strong><ul><li>This is because [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/adverse-drug-reactions/references/\">WHO, 2002</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/adverse-drug-reactions/references/\">MHRA, 2007</a>]:<ul><li>Tests in animals are insufficient to predict human safety.</li><li>Participants in clinical trials are selected and limited in number; the conditions of actual use differ from those in clinical trials, and trials have limited duration.</li><li>Exposure of fewer than 5000 human subjects to a drug allows only the more common ADRs to be detected before the drug is licensed.</li><li>At least 30,000 people need to be treated with a drug to be sure that at least 1 person with an ADR that has an incidence of 1 in 10,000 exposed persons is not missed.</li><li>Information about rare but serious adverse reactions, long-term effects, use in special groups (such as children, elderly people, or pregnant women), or drug interactions is often incomplete or not available.</li></ul></li><li>Consequently, pharmacovigilance and reporting of ADRs are important to permit detection of less common but sometimes very serious ADRs.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Additional monitoring </strong><strong>of ADRs is undertaken in the UK by other research organizations independent of the MHRA, such as:</strong><ul><li>The Drug Safety Research Unit (DSRU) in Southampton (<a data-hyperlink-id=\"92d04225-cc53-47fd-9254-a9920182a764\" href=\"http://www.dsru.org/\">www.dsru.org</a>).</li><li>The Tayside Medicines Monitoring Unit (MEMO) (<a data-hyperlink-id=\"918c7567-5412-4cbf-b2bf-a9920182ab3d\" href=\"https://www.dundee.ac.uk/memo\">www.dundee.ac.uk/memo</a>).</li><li>The Health Improvement Network (THIN) in London (<a data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" href=\"https://www.the-health-improvement-network.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" data-hyperlink-id=\"c90dde8b-a7dd-479c-b58f-aa9b0089e396\">https://www.the-health-improvement-network.co.uk</a>).</li><li>QResearch (<a data-hyperlink-id=\"f4ab8180-c914-45c7-accf-a9920182c43c\" href=\"http://www.qresearch.org/\">www.qresearch.org</a>).</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/adverse-drug-reactions/references/\">MHRA, 2015c</a>]</p><!-- end field f8d60180-e0c0-4708-a32b-c6b10a358210 --><!-- end item 9cb492f6-6099-4a90-970e-3f04e5f81aab -->","topic":{"id":"5891f47f-d14e-5ade-b43e-09ab2ee894c3","topicId":"fb7af4be-ae9d-4213-b2ca-ca17ddb868c1","topicName":"Adverse drug reactions","slug":"adverse-drug-reactions","lastRevised":"Last revised in March 2017","chapters":[{"id":"78737b02-a5d5-5686-924f-3bd67a984373","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"3124c32f-664e-57ef-805a-95067102ad32","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"23e3d730-4bbb-5a3a-bd97-77a17bee3f53","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"0974ec45-5b01-515b-b02e-5cad23aacea1","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"6474141f-1642-5857-9d25-033f3b7503f0","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"5bad1097-961b-5653-8f9b-6456f05b7836","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"6be883ff-72cf-54e9-b064-31f4df584e67","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"c6cc81cc-134f-5d98-b79c-967bf65bddd3","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"95dab13c-419c-5de3-b7fd-95118f8b48e5","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"d675aba3-9d84-5b1a-9c2b-79cc7bcab6c3","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"cd63cb73-82b3-5c83-bea6-b82fa98f7888","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
