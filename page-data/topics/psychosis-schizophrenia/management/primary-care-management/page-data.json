This was based on evidence from systematic reviews (particularly with regard to other adverse effects, such as metabolic disturbance) and evidence from effectiveness (pragmatic) trials [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/psychosis-schizophrenia/references/\">Lieberman et al, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/psychosis-schizophrenia/references/\">Jones et al, 2006</a>].</li><li>Considering the similarity of antipsychotic drugs in terms of efficacy, and the uncertainty of health economic evidence, NICE could not make a recommendation for a preference of one antipsychotic over another.

NICE looked at evidence from a Cochrane systematic review which included 10 trials of chlorpromazine cessation in 1042 people with stable schizophrenia [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/psychosis-schizophrenia/references/\">Almerie et al, 2008</a>]. This review found evidence that people stopping chlorpromazine had a relative risk of relapse in the short term (up to 8 weeks) of 6.76 (95% CI 3.37 to 13.54) and in the medium term (9 weeks to 6 months) of 4.04 (95% CI 2.81 to 5.8). Relative risk of relapse after 6 months was 1.70 (95% CI 1.44 to 2.01).</li></ul><h5><strong>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</strong></h5><ul><li>NICE found evidence that, compared with standard care, CBT was effective in reducing re-hospitalization rates at up to 18 months after the end of treatment. Robust evidence indicated that the duration of hospitalization was also reduced (by 8.26 days on average). CBT reduced symptom severity both at the end of treatment and at up to 12 months follow-up. Robust small-to-medium effects were found for reductions in depression when CBT was compared with both standard care and other active treatments. Furthermore, compared with treatment as usual, there was some evidence for improvements in social functioning for up to 12 months.</li></ul><h5><strong>Family intervention</strong></h5><ul><li>NICE found evidence from 32 RCTs with 2429 participants that, compared with standard care or treatment as usual, risk of relapse was reduced from family intervention. Length of treatment ranged from 6 weeks to 13 months. The number needed to treat was 4 (95% CI 3.23 to 5.88) for every four people who received family therapy, relapse was prevented in one person. In addition, family intervention reduced hospital admissions during treatment and reduced the severity of symptoms both during, and for up to 24 months after, the intervention.</li></ul><h5><strong>Arts therapy</strong></h5><ul><li>NICE found consistent evidence that arts therapies were effective for reducing negative symptoms compared with any other control group. Some evidence indicated that the medium-to-large effects found at the end of treatment were sustained at up to 6 months follow up.</li></ul><!-- end field 478fad65-55e9-4368-a1cf-413b4d71d34f --><!-- end item 43b00878-6b65-4f3e-9e72-eef76b008011 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
