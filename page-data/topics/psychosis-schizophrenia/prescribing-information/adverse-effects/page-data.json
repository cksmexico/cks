CKS recommends that people who may benefit from a dose reduction or switching drugs should be referred to specialist mental health services, or that advice should be sought.</li><li><strong>Adverse effects include </strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/psychosis-schizophrenia/references/\">Taylor, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/psychosis-schizophrenia/references/\">Joint Formulary Committee, 2020</a>]<strong>:</strong><ul><li><strong>Extrapyramidal symptoms </strong>— more common with first-generation antipsychotics. They include:<ul><li>Dystonic reactions (abnormal movements of the face and body), and pseudoparkinsonism (tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity) — these can be alleviated by antimuscarinic drugs, such as procyclidine (should not be prescribed routinely).</li><li>Akathisia (motor restlessness) —  can often be relieved by reducing the dose of the antipsychotic.</li><li>Tardive dyskinesia — late-onset movement disorder that can occur with prolonged use of antipsychotics. It is characterized by rhythmical, involuntary movements, usually lip-smacking and tongue rotating, although it can affect the limbs and trunk. It may be persistent and can sometimes worsen on treatment withdrawal. The drug should be discontinued on appearance of early signs.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Weight gain </strong>— common with all antipsychotics, but more frequent with second-generation antipsychotics. In general, clozapine and olanzapine have the greatest potential to cause weight gain, followed by chlorpromazine, quetiapine, and risperidone.</li><li><strong>Dyslipidaemia </strong>— phenothiazines (such as chlorpromazine), clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone all increase lipid levels. Offer dietary advice and consider treatment with a statin according to national guidelines.</li><li><strong>Hyperprolactinaemia </strong>— most antipsychotics can cause hyperprolactinaemia that may lead to galactorrhoea, amenorrhoea, gynaecomastia, hypogonadism, sexual dysfunction, and an increased risk of osteoporosis. Clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole do not increase prolactin above the normal range in standard doses.</li><li><strong>Sedation </strong>— chlorpromazine, clozapine, promazine, and zotepine cause the highest incidence of sedation. Amisulpride, aripiprazole, sertindole, and sulpiride are associated with a very low incidence of sedation. Performance of skilled tasks (such as driving) may be affected and the effects of alcohol are enhanced. Tolerance to sedation usually develops.</li><li><strong>Sleep apnoea syndrome</strong> — reported in patients using quetiapine. Quetiapine should be used with caution in people receiving concomitant central nervous system depressants and who have a history of, or are at risk for, sleep apnoea, such as those who are overweight/obese or are male [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/psychosis-schizophrenia/references/\">ABPI, 2019</a>].</li><li><strong>Anticholinergic effects </strong>(such as dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, constipation, and cutaneous flushing) — chlorpromazine and clozapine have potent anticholinergic effects. Tolerance may develop, but it is very variable, and these adverse effects are often poorly tolerated.<ul><li>Quetiapine should be used with caution in people taking other drugs with anticholinergic effects [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/psychosis-schizophrenia/references/\">ABPI, 2019</a>].</li></ul></li><li><strong>Postural hypotension </strong>— commonly associated with clozapine, chlorpromazine, quetiapine, and risperidone.</li><li><strong>Hypertension </strong>— commonly reported with clozapine but there are also reports with aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. Hypertension can occur as:<ul><li>A small, steady increase in blood pressure over time (may be associated with weight gain), <em>or</em></li><li>An unpredictable, sharp increase in blood pressure on starting a new drug.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Reduced seizure threshold </strong>— seizures are a recognized adverse effect of antipsychotics (the higher the dose, the greater the risk). Clozapine carries the greatest risk.</li><li><strong>Impaired glucose tolerance </strong>— more common in people with schizophrenia than in the general population, and has been associated with both first-generation and second-generation antipsychotic drugs [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/psychosis-schizophrenia/references/\">MHRA, 2011</a>]. Hyperglycaemia, and sometimes diabetes (including ketoacidosis and coma) can occur in people taking clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine.</li><li><strong>QT interval prolongation </strong>— the most widely reported cardiac conduction defect caused by antipsychotics and considered to be a class effect [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/psychosis-schizophrenia/references/\">MHRA, 2006</a>].<ul><li>Avoid co-prescribing other drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval (for example tricyclic antidepressants, erythromycin, or antiarrhythmics), and monitor potassium levels at least annually.</li><li>People taking antipsychotics who experience palpitations or any other symptoms that suggest cardiac disease should undergo electrocardiography.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Stroke risk </strong>—<strong> </strong>olanzapine and risperidone are associated with an increased risk of stroke in elderly people with dementia. The Committee on Safety of Medicines has advised [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/psychosis-schizophrenia/references/\">CSM, 2004</a>] that:<ul><li>For acute psychotic conditions in elderly people with dementia, risperidone should be limited to short-term use under specialist advice. Olanzapine is not licensed for acute psychosis.</li><li>The possibility of cerebrovascular events should be considered carefully before treating people with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack risk factors for cerebrovascular disease (for example hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and atrial fibrillation) should also be considered.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) </strong>— antipsychotic use may be associated with an increased risk of VTE [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/psychosis-schizophrenia/references/\">MHRA, 2009b</a>].<ul><li>Data are insufficient to determine any difference in risk between second-generation and first-generation antipsychotics, or between individual drugs.</li><li>All possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during antipsychotic treatment and preventive measures undertaken.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) </strong>— is a rare but potentially fatal adverse effect of all antipsychotics. Signs and symptoms of NMS include fever, increased sweating, rigidity, confusion, fluctuating consciousness, fluctuating blood pressure, tachycardia, raised creatine kinase, leucocytosis, and raise liver function tests.</li><li><strong>Pneumonia </strong>— recent evidence from observational studies suggest that all antipsychotics are associated with an increased risk of pneumonia. The mechanism by which this occurs is unclear.</li><li><strong>Neutropenia </strong>— stop the suspected drug if neutrophils fall below 1.5 x 109/L and seek urgent advice from a secondary care specialist.</li><li><strong>Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) </strong>— stop the suspected drug if LFTs suggest hepatitis (transaminases rise to three times normal) or prothrombin time or albumin are abnormal. Seek advice from a secondary care specialist.</li><li><strong>Photosensitivity </strong>— is common with chlorpromazine. Adequate use of sunscreen will prevent sunburn in affected people. Some high-factor sunscreens (sun protection factor 30 or above) are available on prescription. The prescription should be endorsed with ACBS.</li><li><strong>Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders</strong> — olanzapine has been associated with Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), frequency unknown [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/psychosis-schizophrenia/references/\">ABPI, 2019</a>]. Quetiapine has also been reported to cause an extensive rash, exfoliative dermatitis, fever, lymphadenopathy, and eosinophilia. If any of these are reported then treatment should be withdrawn immediately as it may be suggestive of a severe cutaneous severe reaction, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/psychosis-schizophrenia/references/\">ABPI, 2020</a>]. </li><li><strong>Diplopia </strong>— is an uncommon adverse effect with aripiprazole. </li><li><strong>Misuse and abuse</strong> — cases of misuse and abuse have been reported with quetiapine. Quetiapine should be prescribed with caution in people who have a history of drug or alcohol abuse.</li><li><strong>Restless legs syndrome </strong>— this is an uncommon adverse effect.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 251f5e93-7ef8-4544-be0f-448e255b9f4e --><!-- end item 9ee6ab09-2236-4873-be7c-1b201556ca1b -->","topic":{"id":"9b90da89-2ffd-5b6a-9fc6-ea342404d5d8","topicId":"fd02ebc3-0f02-42b5-8737-e0608ca4330d","topicName":"Psychosis and schizophrenia","slug":"psychosis-schizophrenia","lastRevised":"Last revised in November 2020","chapters":[{"id":"d60310a0-752b-5399-8488-a567bf6a3925","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"10869ad6-510d-54db-bc6a-ce3618a1c478","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"1025e31f-c89d-5344-b4ae-d5e8950a5c0e","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"594160f5-1a9b-56f0-952c-5c400ea28785","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"e20c0ce8-30f6-5e09-81d1-3e6005f85efe","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"4c4f0990-85fa-5fc4-9a58-9f02a868a971","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"02637a5f-4552-5e73-9245-cf480497e9a5","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"8c88de52-9655-52d8-b302-67641ae05beb","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"c6754da2-fd29-5d45-8097-40b8ec0589cd","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"31a210b8-403b-5530-b1ea-0b44a2595f07","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"c5630117-b04c-558a-b516-41c3eab9adbd","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
