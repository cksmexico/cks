Hallucinations which are visual, smell, taste, or tactile in nature occur less commonly.</li><li><strong>Delusions (fixed or falsely-held beliefs) </strong>can include delusions of reference (the belief that ordinary events, objects, or the behaviour of others has a meaning specifically for the person, for example, that people on the radio are talking to, or about, them), delusions of control (the belief that the person's thoughts, feelings, or behaviour are being controlled by others. They include thought insertion, thought withdrawal, and thought broadcasting), and delusions of persecution (the belief that other people are plotting against the person).</li><li><strong>Disorganised behaviour, speech, and/or thoughts (thought disturbance).</strong></li></ul></li><li><strong>Negative symptoms, such as:</strong><ul><li>Emotional blunting.</li><li>Reduced speech.</li><li>Loss of motivation.</li><li>Self-neglect.</li><li>Social withdrawal.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Schizophrenia is the most common psychotic disorder. The diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia (using the International Classification of Diseases-10 [ICD-10] criteria) require the following s</strong><strong>ymptoms to be present most of the time for 1 month or more:</strong><ul><li><strong>One or more of the following features:</strong><ul><li>Hallucinatory voices giving a running commentary on the person's behaviour, or discussing the person among themselves, or other types of hallucinatory voices coming from some part of the body.</li><li>Thought echo, thought insertion or withdrawal, and thought broadcasting.</li><li>Delusions of control, influence, or passivity, clearly referred to body or limb movements or specific thoughts, actions, or sensations.</li><li>Persistent delusions of other kinds that are culturally inappropriate and completely impossible, such as religious or political identity, or superhuman powers and abilities (for example being able to control the weather, or being in communication with aliens from another world).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Or any two of the following criteria:</strong><ul><li>Persistent hallucinations in any form, when accompanied by fleeting or half-formed delusions without clear affective content, or by persistent over-valued ideas (similar to preoccupations), or when occurring every day for weeks or months on end.</li><li>Breaks or interpolations in the train of thought, resulting in incoherence or irrelevant speech, or neologisms (invented words).</li><li>Catatonic behaviour, such as excitement, posturing, or waxy flexibility; negativism; mutism; and stupor.</li><li>Negative symptoms, such as marked apathy, reduced speech, and blunting or incongruity of emotional responses, usually resulting in social withdrawal and lowering of social performance; it must be clear that these are not due to depression or to antipsychotic medication.</li><li>A significant and consistent change in the overall quality of some aspects of personal behaviour, manifest as loss of interest, aimlessness, idleness, a self-absorbed attitude, and social withdrawal.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Other psychotic disorders include:</strong><ul><li>Schizoaffective disorder — where symptoms of schizophrenia and a mood disorder (depressed or manic) are equally prominent.</li><li>Drug-induced psychosis — substance-induced and usually remits within a month of cessation of use.</li><li>Persistent delusional disorder — where the most pervasive symptom is delusion.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/psychosis-schizophrenia/references/\">WHO, 1992</a>; <a
