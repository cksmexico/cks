The EMA review confirmed the well-known risks of neurological effects such as short-term extrapyramidal adverse effects. This risk is higher in children, although tardive dyskinesia was reported more often in the elderly, and the risk is increased at high doses or with long-term treatment. The EMA states that the risks outweighed the benefits of metoclopramide in conditions requiring long-term treatment. There have also been very rare cases of serious cardiovascular adverse effects, particularly after injection of the drug.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendations to try simple measures and to consider offering chlorphenamine to treat itch are based on the opinion of previous expert reviewers of this CKS topic. There was no consensus regarding the use of ursodeoxycholic acid, colestyramine, and corticosteroids, and as liver-associated itch can be difficult to treat, CKS pragmatically recommends seeking specialist advice if chlorphenamine is ineffective or there is severe liver impairment.</li></ul><h5>Advice for pregnant women</h5><ul><li>The recommendations about the risks that infection may pose in pregnancy are based on expert opinion within a systematic review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-a/references/\">Chaudhry and Koren, 2015</a>]. However, the evidence of an increased risk of preterm delivery is considered to be weak, being based on a small case series of 13 women with acute hepatitis in the second and third trimesters [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-a/references/\">Elinav et al, 2006</a>]. Data on other pregnancy outcomes following hepatitis A infection in pregnancy are unavailable.</li><li>The recommendations about breastfeeding are based on expert opinion in the guidelines <em>Viral hepatitis in pregnancy </em>from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-a/references/\">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2007</a>], and <em>National Guidelines for the Management of the Viral Hepatitides</em> from BASHH [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-a/references/\">BASHH, 2017</a>]. There is no evidence that hepatitis A is transmitted in breast milk, and infection is not a contraindication to breastfeeding, but good hygiene measures are pragmatically suggested to reduce any risk of transmission.</li></ul><h5>Referral to a genito-urinary medicine department or a drug rehabilitation agency</h5><ul><li><p>The recommendation to consider referral to a GUM clinic and/or for drug rehabilitation (where appropriate) is based on expert opinion within guidance from BASHH [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-a/references/\">BASHH, 2017</a>], and is also pragmatic based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</p></li></ul><h5>Follow-up</h5><ul><li>The advice on follow-up is based on expert opinion in the British Association of Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) <em>National Guidelines for the Management of the Viral Hepatitides</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-a/references/\">BASHH, 2017</a>], and on the opinion of previous expert reviewers of this CKS topic.</li></ul><!-- end field cb0625d5-00a6-4074-87a8-74c5a4f72d84 --><!-- end item 6b106810-6b7a-4aa5-ae76-ecfcaec94100 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
