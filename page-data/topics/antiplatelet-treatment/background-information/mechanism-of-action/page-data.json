If these become disrupted, platelet-rich thrombi form in the blood vessels and can lead to occlusion of the blood vessel or distal embolization, and result in acute cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or stroke.</li><li>Activation and aggregation of platelets is an integral part of thrombus formation. Antiplatelet drugs inhibit thrombus formation — it is believed that this is how they exert their cardiovascular protective effect.</li><li>Four main types of antiplatelet drugs are available:<ul><li><strong>Aspirin</strong> irreversibly inhibits cyclo-oxygenase and blocks the production of thromboxane.</li><li><strong>Clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor </strong>are thienopyridines. They inhibit the binding of adenosine diphosphate to its platelet receptor, and this is thought to inhibit platelet aggregation by blocking activation of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa pathway.</li><li><strong>Dipyridamole</strong> has both antiplatelet and vasodilatory properties. It is believed to inhibit uptake of adenosine into erythrocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells, resulting in an increased extracellular concentration of adenosine which is a potent inhibitor of platelet activation and aggregation. It may also act by inhibiting the breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate.</li><li><strong>Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors</strong> (for example, abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban) block the binding of fibrinogen to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors on the platelet. These drugs are administered intravenously and are not discussed further in this CKS topic. They are prescribed to high-risk people undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions or to people with acute coronary syndrome to prevent early myocardial infarction.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/antiplatelet-treatment/references/\">NICE, 2010a</a>;
