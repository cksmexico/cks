There was some concern within the GDG that in-depth discussions of possible complications of varicose veins may cause anxiety. It was felt, therefore, that although misconceptions should be explored, it was not necessary to introduce new factors that may cause anxiety and that information should be tailored to the person and their needs [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h5>Self-care advice</h5><ul><li>Evidence reviewed by NICE identified a high body mass index (BMI) as a risk factor for progression to more serious varicose veins and also a factor predicting worse outcome after treatment compared with a normal BMI [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>].</li><li>The NICE GDG felt that light to moderate physical activity (for example walking or swimming) may help but that strenuous exercise may aggravate varicose veins. The available evidence suggested that exercise was not an independent factor for increasing or reducing varicose veins progression, but the GDG felt it was important to tell people that light to moderate physical activity is safe, as the positive overall health effects of health promotion outweigh any small risks (from which there is no evidence) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">NICE, 2013</a>].</li><li>The NICE GDG noted that aggravating factors are individual to the person with varicose veins. The experience of the primary care members of the GDG was that people with varicose veins had often worked out the factors that exacerbated their symptoms (for example hot baths and prolonged standing) and they should be advised to avoid these factors where possible [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">NICE, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h5>Referral to a vascular service</h5><ul><li>The NICE referral criteria are based on evidence from two prognostic reviews, although the evidence was limited in terms of quality and consistency. They are also based on the expert opinion of the NICE GDG [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>]. <ul><li>Referral is usually recommended for symptom control and to prevent disease progression. <ul><li>Symptomatic varicose veins — NICE found evidence showing that interventional treatment is cost effective in this case. The NICE GDG also considered that evaluation by a vascular surgeon was necessary to make the decision that compression stockings should be offered (only recommended if the person is unsuitable or declines interventional therapy). </li><li>Lower limb skin changes — if a person has skin changes due to venous hypertension, they are at increased risk of developing venous leg ulcers. Therefore, the GDG felt referral was appropriate to plan prophylactic treatment.</li><li>Superficial vein thrombosis (characterized by the appearance of hard, painful veins) and suspected venous incompetence — the GDG made this recommendation based on evidence that deep vein thrombosis is present in 20% of legs with superficial vein thrombosis.</li><li>Venous leg ulcer (a break in the skin below the knee that has not healed within 2 weeks) — the GDG recommends early referral (within 2 weeks) as ulcers of longer duration are more difficult to heal.</li><li>A healed venous leg ulcer — NICE recommends referral as these people may benefit from interventional treatment.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>NICE recommends referral to a vascular service, where a full clinical and duplex Doppler ultrasound assessment as well as a full range of treatments can be provided.<ul><li>The GDG highlighted that the location of this service can be decided locally, with some of the service being delivered in primary care where skills and equipment are available.</li><li>The GDG acknowledged that people referred would not necessarily receive interventional treatment but could still benefit from the expertise available from vascular specialists.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Compression stockings </h5><ul><li>An evidence review commissioned by NICE compared compression stockings with no treatment or lifestyle advice for varicose veins. Evidence from three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and five observational studies were of poor quality, and it was difficult to draw conclusions on a number of outcomes. However, a clinical benefit was demonstrated with compression stockings for the symptoms of heavy or tired legs, and overall complaints of symptoms [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>].</li><li>A Cochrane systematic review (search date: August 2013) aimed to assess the effectiveness of compression stockings as the only initial treatment of varicose veins but was unable to draw firm conclusions because of the lack of good-quality evidence [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">Shingler et al, 2013</a>].</li><li>NICE made no definite recommendation on how to manage people in primary care for whom referral is not indicated. CKS has extrapolated the recommendations from the NICE recommendation that compression hosiery should not be offered for the treatment of varicose veins unless interventional treatment is unsuitable [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">NICE, 2013</a>]. This recommendation is also consistent with expert opinion in a review article, which states that compression stockings alone may be appropriate for people who are too unfit for intervention and for people who do not wish to have any form of surgical intervention [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">Wright and Fitridge, 2013</a>].</li><li>The NICE GDG reported a variation in practice in terms of types of stockings used but found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the type of compression stockings to be offered. The GDG was of the opinion that although class 3 stockings may be more effective than class 1 or 2, they are more difficult to put on. The GDG noted that compliance is very important as treatment will not be effective if stockings are not worn [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Managing pregnant women</h5><ul><li>Varicose veins can develop during, or be exacerbated by, pregnancy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">RCS/Vascular Society, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">Smyth, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">Ismail, 2016</a>].</li><li>The recommendations on treating varicose veins in pregnancy are based on expert opinion in the NICE guidelines on varicose veins [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">NICE, 2013</a>], the joint RCS and Vascular Society publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">RCS/Vascular Society, 2013</a>], the NICE guideline <em>Antenatal care for uncomplicated pregnancies </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2010</a>], and a Department of Health (DoH) publication <em>The Pregnancy Book</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">DH, 2016</a>].<ul><li>The NICE guideline on antenatal care states, on the basis of one low-quality RCT, that compression stockings can improve symptoms but will not prevent varicose veins from emerging<em> </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2010</a>].</li><li>The GDG of the NICE varicose veins guideline<em> </em>recommends considering compression stockings for the symptom relief of leg swelling associated with varicose veins in pregnancy.
