These in turn drain via the perforator veins, which pass through a muscular fascial layer, into the deep veins.</li><li>Varicose veins are thought to be caused by incompetent valves in the affected vein, which result in reflux of blood and increased pressure in the vein distally. Unlike deep veins, which have thick walls and are confined by fascia, superficial veins are unable to withstand the high pressure and eventually become dilated and tortuous.</li><li>Other pathological factors, such as weakness or degeneration of the vein wall, may also be involved in the development of varicose veins.</li><li>The increase in venous pressure in the leg is usually particularly marked if there is also incompetence in deep veins.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Risk factors for developing varicose veins include:</strong><ul><li><strong>Increasing age</strong> — the prevalence of varicose veins increases with age [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">NICE, 2013</a>]. In a study in which participants were divided into three age cohorts of 40, 50, and 60 year olds, the prevalence of varicose veins overall was 22%, 35%, and 41%, respectively [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">Laurikka, 2002</a>]. </li><li><strong>Family history of varicose veins</strong> — there is likely a significant hereditary component to the development of varicose veins [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">Fan, 2003</a>]. A case-control study found that the risk of developing varicose veins is 90% if both parents are affected, 25% in males and 62% in females if one parent is affected, and 20% if no parent is affected [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">Cornu-Thenard, 1994</a>]. </li><li><strong>Female sex</strong> — many studies have shown a greater prevalence of varicose veins in females than males. An analysis of 21 epidemiological studies showed that the overall prevalence of visible varicose veins in the Western population older than 15 years of age was 10–15% in males and 20–25% in females [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">Callam, 1994</a>]. The higher prevalence in women is thought to be due to the effects of the female hormones on the veins: progesterone is thought to lead to passive venous dilation, which may then lead to valvular dysfunction; oestrogen produces collagen fibre changes and smooth muscle relaxation, both of which lead to venous dilation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">BMJ, 2017</a>].</li><li><strong>Pregnancy</strong> — this is thought to be a major contributory factor in the increased incidence of varicose veins in women [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">RCS/Vascular Society, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">Smyth, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">Ismail, 2016</a>]. A study reported the prevalence of varicose veins in women with one, two, three, and four or more pregnancies as 38%, 43%, 48%, and 59%, respectively [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">Laurikka, 2002</a>]. Pregnancy increases blood volume and intra-abdominal pressure, both of which may cause venous distension. Hormonal changes during pregnancy also play a role in the development of varicose veins [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">BMJ, 2017</a>].</li><li><strong>Obesity</strong> — being overweight or obese can increase the risk of developing varicose veins. The impact of body weight on the development of varicose veins appears to be more significant in women than in men [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">BMJ, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">DePopas, 2018</a>]. </li><li><strong>Prolonged standing or sitting</strong> — studies have shown that prolonged standing and sitting are risk factors for venous symptoms, including varicose veins [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">Laurikka, 2002</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">Carpentier et al, 2004</a>]. </li><li><strong>History of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)</strong> — DVT may cause valvular damage and dysfunction in the deep veins, leading to increased pressure with subsequent distension and varicose vein formation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/varicose-veins/references/\">BMJ, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 6499add2-8391-4184-ae60-2b39a2698b5d --><!-- end item 2a2ac051-352a-48e1-9731-4d24b46aa0eb -->","topic":{"id":"a5effee8-b819-5110-ae01-3291f38b5afb","topicId":"c50e0451-4ec9-4152-931e-7ef7bbe33953","topicName":"Varicose veins","slug":"varicose-veins","lastRevised":"Last revised in February 2020","chapters":[{"id":"3f6f2139-715b-5f2b-beed-0f345abb7706","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"14f3332d-9699-5a78-ae56-19852e16423c","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"68cee683-a334-53e2-951d-2213e3f5a5f4","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"18a04bb0-7231-5635-8588-e364668dbdbc","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"e21bdee9-fa44-5772-96a8-d88179b5aaac","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"37eda018-9fc3-5eee-9777-c12c7cf674ad","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"f259edde-1383-543b-a48d-c0bd5ef5c938","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"a3e6b4e9-b847-5269-89fa-950b55b309e1","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"72014964-83a4-54b1-9e86-bc9a2f2416a8","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"29a954eb-660f-53c9-9490-a36b5a25a5ac","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"97a25e98-61ae-5179-b6c5-7b216a4e88b9","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP - Options for local implementation"},{"id":"89c37412-1ebb-5157-beaf-c2aba0422920","slug":"nice-quality-standards","fullItemName":"NICE quality standards"}]},{"id":"8e971950-a08f-553c-aaea-ee3930c16878","fullItemName":"Background information","slug":"background-information","subChapters":[{"id":"5e15ae74-1438-508e-b1f4-9cbe1e344ae7","slug":"definition","fullItemName":"Definition"},{"id":"420511d9-0f1a-5eb4-b599-3cccb46a776a","slug":"causes-risk-factors","fullItemName":"Causes and risk factors"},{"id":"118fc1b2-59f5-5172-af41-d4cc71e8ff9d","slug":"prevalence","fullItemName":"Prevalence"},{"id":"af6bc67a-ea78-5689-a7e4-ce27686dfd16","slug":"complications","fullItemName":"Complications"},{"id":"1845cad1-73e7-5981-a72b-8b4be1f80fd1","slug":"prognosis","fullItemName":"Prognosis"}]},{"id":"5fc4e559-b9b8-540b-ab68-4296126a2a80","fullItemName":"Diagnosis","slug":"diagnosis","subChapters":[{"id":"f3d726c0-62b8-5ded-9011-c6318448004f","slug":"assessment","fullItemName":"Assessment"}]},{"id":"5a07dc10-156e-5619-8fe5-f309151ac5b1","fullItemName":"Management","slug":"management","subChapters":[{"id":"9c56b6cb-b693-5ff4-8604-94456609920d","slug":"varicose-veins","fullItemName":"Scenario: Varicose veins"}]},{"id":"bbb07889-52e9-584e-bae2-637c712cfd04","fullItemName":"Supporting evidence","slug":"supporting-evidence","subChapters":[]},{"id":"4a7a2326-4594-5b56-a97f-41269cd0f1a0","fullItemName":"How this topic was developed","slug":"how-this-topic-was-developed","subChapters":[{"id":"d9b00c99-a52e-5ca6-a05c-a96bfe7f52e0","slug":"search-strategy","fullItemName":"Search strategy"},{"id":"510001f8-6aec-5bef-83f9-c686d9eb9135","slug":"stakeholder-engagement","fullItemName":"Stakeholder engagement"},{"id":"6bbca820-f6d4-50d3-8d06-25029066f7c4","slug":"evidence-exclusion-criteria","fullItemName":"Evidence exclusion criteria"},{"id":"1480a066-e7fd-503c-89d2-a69a118a28e7","slug":"organizational-behavioural-financial-barriers","fullItemName":"Organizational, behavioural and financial barriers"},{"id":"5ad33249-762e-5b24-b02a-7d650eb25e0e","slug":"declarations-of-interest","fullItemName":"Declarations of interest"}]},{"id":"34149855-c5c4-5f7b-93aa-099738ff4e9f","fullItemName":"References","slug":"references","subChapters":[]}]},"parentChapter":{"id":"8e971950-a08f-553c-aaea-ee3930c16878","slug":"background-information","fullItemName":"Background information"},"subChapters":[]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
