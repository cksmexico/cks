include:<ul><li>Defined physical or mental health conditions, such as diabetes or schizophrenia.</li><li>Ongoing conditions, such as learning disability.</li><li>Symptom complexes, such as frailty or chronic pain.</li><li>Sensory impairment, such as sight or hearing loss.</li><li>Alcohol or substance misuse.</li></ul></li><li>The prevalence of multimorbidity is around 23–27% — this increases significantly with age and socioeconomic deprivation, and is almost universal in older adults.</li><li>Multimorbidity is associated with:<ul><li>Reduced quality of life.</li><li>Reduced life expectancy.</li><li>High treatment burden.</li><li>Mental health difficulties, such as anxiety and depression.</li><li>Fragmentation and problems of coordination of care.</li><li>Functional difficulties.</li><li>Polypharmacy and higher rates of adverse drug events.</li><li>Increased use of health services (including unplanned, or emergency care).</li></ul></li><li>Identification of people who may benefit from a multimorbidity approach should be carried out either opportunistically during routine care, or proactively using healthcare records.<ul><li>Consider using a validated tool, such as the Electronic Frailty Index (eFI).</li></ul></li><li>A multimorbidity approach should be considered for people if they:<ul><li>Find it difficult to manage their treatments or day-to-day activities.</li><li>Receive care and support from multiple services and need additional services.</li><li>Have both long-term physical and mental health conditions.</li><li>Have frailty or are at risk of falls.</li><li>Frequently seek unplanned or emergency care.</li><li>Are prescribed more than 10 regular medicines, or are prescribed fewer than 10 regular medicines, but are at particular risk of adverse events.</li></ul></li><li>Assessment of people with multimorbidity should include:<ul><li>Establishing the extent of disease burden.</li><li>Establishing the treatment burden.</li><li>Exploring the person's attitudes to their treatments and the potential benefits and harms of those treatments.</li><li>Asking about, and considering social circumstances, health literacy, functional autonomy, and use of coping strategies.</li><li>Being alert to the possibility of depression and anxiety, and chronic pain.</li><li>Encouraging people with multimorbidity to clarify what is important to them, including their personal goals, values and priorities.</li><li>Clarifying whether, and how, they would like their partner, family members and/or carers to be involved in key decisions about the management of their conditions.</li><li>Consider assessing frailty in people with multimorbidity.</li></ul></li><li>Management of people with multimorbidity should focus on:<ul><li>How the person's health conditions and their treatments interact and how this affects quality of life.</li><li>The person's individual needs, preferences for treatments, health priorities, lifestyle and goals.</li><li>The benefits and risks of following recommendations from guidance on single health conditions.</li><li>Improving quality of life by reducing treatment burden, adverse events, and unplanned care.</li><li>Improving coordination of care across services.</li></ul></li><li>Management should also include:<ul><li>Discussing the purpose of a multimorbidity approach.</li><li>Reviewing medicines and other treatments and taking into account evidence of likely benefits and harms for the individual patient and outcomes important to the person.</li><li>Developing and agreeing an individualised management plan.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 1b93431d-99f0-4192-8b2b-a8da0111079a --><!-- end item 08a93539-9e74-49e6-989d-a8da0111079a
