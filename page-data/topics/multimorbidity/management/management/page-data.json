need for a multimorbidity approach</h5><ul><li>Although an approach to care that takes explicit account of multimorbidity is not always required, current management strategies may be suboptimal for those with complex healthcare needs as a result of multimorbidity [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/multimorbidity/references/\">AMS, 2018</a>]. </li><li>Current disease-oriented guidelines do not account for the interactions between the different diseases [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/multimorbidity/references/\">Muth, 2014</a>]. </li><li>Guidelines rarely deal with comorbidity, in part because they are designed to be based on evidence from randomised controlled trials and because trials routinely exclude older people and people with multiple chronic conditions [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/multimorbidity/references/\">Wallace, 2015</a>].  <ul><li>Individual guideline recommendations may be rational and evidence-based, but the sum of all recommendations in an individual is not.</li></ul></li><li>Evidence for recommendations in NICE guidance on single health conditions is regularly drawn from people without multimorbidity taking fewer prescribed regular medicines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/multimorbidity/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>]. <ul><li>NICE recommends thinking carefully about the risks and benefits of individual treatments recommended in guidance for single health conditions for people with multimorbidity.</li><li>The aim of taking a multimorbidity approach is to help optimise care by reducing treatment burden (polypharmacy and multiple appointments) and unplanned care, and ultimately to improve quality of life by promoting shared decisions based on what is important to each person in terms of treatments, health priorities, lifestyle and goals.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Self-management of multimorbidity</h5><ul><li>WHO suggests that prioritising care coordination and self-management support is a strategy which helps address safer care for people with multimorbidity, including [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/multimorbidity/references/\">WHO, 2016</a>]:<ul><li>Promoting self-management to help people with multiple conditions take responsibility for their well-being and safety.</li><li>Implementing education and engagement strategies for people with multimorbidity.</li><li>Supporting informal caregivers, such as friends, carers and family.</li></ul></li><li>After the prioritization of problems, a care plan which sets out monitoring, treatment, prevention, and (self-) management advice should be developed to meet shared and realistic treatment goals [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/multimorbidity/references/\">Muth, 2014</a>]. <ul><li>Consider self-management according to the person's needs and capabilities.</li></ul></li><li>Some evidence supports 'lay led' self-management education programmes for single chronic diseases in improving certain outcomes, such as self-efficacy and self-rated health [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/multimorbidity/references/\">Wallace, 2015</a>].  <ul><li>The evidence for such an approach with multimorbidity is, however, mixed.</li><li>The person's preference should guide the utilisation of lay led self-management groups.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field c1c52a10-c478-4313-8d04-a8da01295d47 --><!-- end item 857b9aa2-2474-40b8-b0dc-a8da01295d47
