It can also be drug induced.<ul><li>Organic causes may be vasculogenic (for example cardiovascular disease [CVD], hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus); neurogenic (for example multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease); anatomical (for example Peyronie’s disease, hypospadias, prostate cancer), or hormonal (for example hypogonadism, hyper-and hypothyroidism, Cushing’s disease).</li><li>Psychogenic causes may be situational (for example due to psychiatric illness [such as depression]) or generalized (for example due to lack of arousability).</li><li>Drugs that can cause erectile dysfunction include antihypertensives, antipsychotics, and antidepressants.</li></ul></li><li>The risk factors for erectile dysfunction are similar to those for CVD and include obesity, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, lack of exercise, and smoking. </li><li>Erectile dysfunction is also, in itself, an independent marker of significantly increased risk of CVD. It is also a marker of significantly increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, and all-cause mortality. </li><li>Erectile dysfunction is a very common disorder. It can occur at any age but is more common in older men. </li><li>It can affect the physical, emotional, and psychosocial health of the sufferer and can also have a significant impact on the person's quality of life and that of their partner. </li><li>Assessment of a man with erectile dysfunction should include:<ul><li>A detailed history, including present and past erection quality, lifestyle (including alcohol intake, smoking status, and illicit drug use), and previous treatments tried.</li><li>A focused physical examination to identify any genitourinary, endocrine, vascular, or neurological causes of erectile dysfunction. </li><li>Appropriate investigations, including glucose-lipid profile and total testosterone, to identify any reversible/modifiable risk factors.</li></ul></li><li>Erectile dysfunction usually responds well to a combination of lifestyle measures (such as weight loss, smoking cessation, and reducing alcohol consumption) and drug treatment.<ul><li>Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, or avanafil) are recommended first-line, regardless of suspected cause (provided there are no contraindications). </li><li>PDE-5 inhibitors are not initiators of erection but require sexual stimulation in order to facilitate erection.</li><li>A low dose should be tried initially, titrating up if ineffective. A man with erectile dysfunction should receive 6–8 doses of a PDE-5 inhibitor at a maximum dose with sexual stimulation before being classified as a non-responder.</li></ul></li><li>Referral should be arranged:<ul><li>To urology — for young men who have always had erectile dysfunction and for all men with a history of trauma to genital area, pelvis or spine; abnormality of the penis or testicles; or no response to maximum dose of at least two PDE-5 inhibitors.</li><li>To endocrinology — if hypogonadism is suspected (abnormal serum testosterone).</li><li>To cardiology — if the man has CVD that makes sexual activity unsafe or contraindicates PDE-5 inhibitor use.</li><li>To mental health services — if an underlying psychogenic cause is suspected or the man has severe mental distress.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 0265ab13-3488-426c-946f-1b561d62b1ab --><!-- end item d999f47d-ad16-4dd5-ae45-a2055cc945dc -->","topic":{"id":"5bdc98b8-cec1-551c-a1ea-d279c1d4a789","topicId":"a255a0a6-1216-4961-a8d2-0841d9ddf8fe","topicName":"Erectile dysfunction","slug":"erectile-dysfunction","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"60de3c56-e8f8-5ed1-af6c-079fbfc5297a","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"1390eb84-15de-5511-a888-7aa10c5f380e","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"6f0e3524-4bd9-524b-b0c7-5df8463a2632","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"6f8d7396-341b-5cdb-9ab7-11d371aecf1b","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"7273623f-46a6-55a9-b20f-3174d857bb0b","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"954f3dd9-902d-5807-89cb-b68e9a352975","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"4dbc024b-ad9c-5c73-975f-44d47f56c8db","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"3c8ab157-63cf-5e79-95c8-8d533751d80b","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"c87478c5-0e05-5e5e-aff4-92c6bd965c7e","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"7aad46cb-3cd1-586a-9eb7-5b41fb304896","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"792aba04-631e-555e-8bf8-2c58ec675d8d","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
