Nonetheless, improvement in lifestyle can improve the general cardiovascular health and overall well-being of the man. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Cycling</strong><ul><li>There is some evidence that long-distance cycling (for example more than 3 hours a week) can cause erectile dysfunction, possibly due to nerve damage caused by contact with the saddle [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/erectile-dysfunction/references/\">Muneer, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/erectile-dysfunction/references/\">BMJ, 2017</a>], but further research is needed to confirm this [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/erectile-dysfunction/references/\">Michiels, 2015</a>].

Test results on several remedies including ‘Africa Black Ant’, ‘Rock Hard Weekend’, ‘Pandora’, and ‘The Best’ showed that they contain sildenafil (which is a prescription-only medicine).

According to the EAU [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/erectile-dysfunction/references/\">European Association of Urology, 2017</a>]:<ul><li>The most common causes of incorrect drug use are:<ul><li>Failure to use an adequate dose.</li><li>Failure to wait an adequate amount of time between taking the medication and attempting sexual intercourse.</li><li>Failure to use adequate sexual stimulation. The efficacy of PDE-5 inhibitor action is dependent on the release of nitric oxide (NO) by the parasympathetic nerve endings in the erectile tissue of the penis, which improves the relaxation of smooth muscles. The usual stimulus for NO release is sexual stimulation; therefore, without adequate sexual stimulation (and NO release), PDE-5 treatment will be ineffective.</li></ul></li><li>It is important to check that the person has been using a licensed product, as there is a large counterfeit market in PDE-5 inhibitors and the amount of active drug in these products varies greatly.</li><li>After addressing these factors (that is, emphasising the importance of dose, timing, sexual stimulation, and the use of licensed medications), erectile function can be effectively restored following re-administration of the relevant PDE-5 inhibitor.</li></ul></li><li>Although PDE-5 inhibitors are effective for most men, about 25% do not respond. It is important to find the reason for this, where possible, as:<ul><li>Treatment failure is often reversible. For instance, hypogonadism is a significant cause of erectile dysfunction that is unresponsive to treatment with PDE-5 inhibitors, with about 20% of men having abnormally low testosterone levels by 65 years of age [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/erectile-dysfunction/references/\">Ojumu and Dobs, 2003</a>]. However, it can be easily reversed with testosterone injections [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/erectile-dysfunction/references/\">BSSM, 2017</a>].</li><li>PDE-5 inhibitors are by far the most convenient treatment for erectile dysfunction. Although <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/erectile-dysfunction/management/management/#follow-up\">other treatments</a> are effective, they are usually more difficult and less pleasant to use.</li></ul></li><li>The effect of PDE-5 inhibitors are partly dose-dependent, so increasing the dose may overcome lack of effect. There is anecdotal evidence that a man may respond to a different PDE-5 inhibitor; therefore, it is worth trialling a different drug before classing PDE-5 inhibitors as ineffective [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/erectile-dysfunction/references/\">UK Medicines Information Pharmacists Group, 2003</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/erectile-dysfunction/references/\">McMahon et al, 2006</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/erectile-dysfunction/references/\">European Association of Urology, 2017</a>].</li></ul><h5>More frequent dosing regimens.</h5><ul><li>In clinical trials, patients were allowed up to daily dosing whereas in clinical practice medication is often restricted. The European Society for Sexual Medicine (ESSM) suggests that daily dosing might salvage as many as 50% of non-responders to a first drug.One study reported that up to 57% of PDE5I failures could be salvaged with up to 12 weeks of tadalafil 10 mg daily. Tadalafil 5 mg daily is licensed for this indication but sildenafil, vardenafil, and avanafil and tadalafil 10 mg and 20 mg can be used in this way within the product licence, which is for anticipated sexual activity (not intercourse).</li><li>Many couples find on-demand therapy totally unacceptable.
