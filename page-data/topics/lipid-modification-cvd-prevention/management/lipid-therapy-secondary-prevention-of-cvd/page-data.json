That is, either the maximum dose has been reached or further titration is limited by intolerance.</li><li>The company provides them with the discount agreed in the patient access scheme.</li></ul></li><li>Alirocumab and evolocumab have marketing authorisation in the UK for adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous-familial and non-familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients unable to reach LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin, or alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or for whom a statin is contraindicated.</li><li>However, the NICE technology appraisal for alirocumab, while acknowledging this considered that [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/lipid-modification-cvd-prevention/references/\">NICE, 2016c</a>]: <ul><li>Although up to approximately 23% of people with primary hypercholesterolemia were currently reported to be intolerant to statins, the true rate was likely to be between 0.5% to 3.0% of the population because there were no clear diagnostic criteria for statin intolerance, and no universally accepted definition of intolerance to statins, so some people could be misidentified as being intolerant to statins.</li><li>People in whom statins are contraindicated have the same unmet clinical need as those who cannot tolerate statins and that there is no biologically plausible reason for alirocumab to work differently in these people. The committee was aware that the populations in the manufacturer's new evidence were defined by the LDL-C level at which treatment with alirocumab should be started and that people who cannot take statins have higher than average LDL-C levels, and would therefore meet the LDL-C levels needed to start treatment with alirocumab for people who can take statins.</li><li>The technology appraisal committee concluded that it was not necessary to make specific separate recommendations for people who cannot take statins.</li></ul></li><li>The NICE technology appraisal for evolocumab considered that absolute statin intolerance was rare and accounted for less than 5% of people, however, 25% of people may have some degree of muscle pain that they perceive as being caused by statin intolerance [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/lipid-modification-cvd-prevention/references/\">NICE, 2016d</a>].  <ul><li>The committee emphasised that its recommendations for evolocumab should only apply when maximal tolerated lipid-lowering therapy had failed and clarified that this meant that either the maximum dose had been reached, or further titration was limited by intolerance.</li><li>The committee was aware that there may also be people in whom statins are contraindicated and these people had the same unmet clinical need as those who cannot tolerate statins, and so should have the same treatment options. In addition, there was no biologically plausible reason for the effect to differ between these two groups.</li><li>The committee concluded that its recommendations should also apply to people in whom statins are contraindicated.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 15b7ac86-0ed6-4991-9ddf-af42431820fb --><!-- end item b93898f6-3ed4-4855-b802-151eca2bb6ac -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
