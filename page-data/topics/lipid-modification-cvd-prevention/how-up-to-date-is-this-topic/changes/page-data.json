Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) has been included as a very rare adverse effect of some statins following an update to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for simvastatin and Lipitor.</p><p><strong>July 2015 </strong>— minor update. Minor text change to remove the percentage equivalents of HbA1c mmol/mol values, which are no longer commonly used to diagnose diabetes mellitus.</p><p><strong>June 2015 </strong>— minor update. Further clarification on the use of ezetimibe for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD).</p><p><strong>May 2015 </strong>— minor update. Following an update to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for atorvastatin, as advised by the European Medicines Agency, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy has been added as a possible adverse effect during or after treatment with atorvastatin (and other statins).</p><p><strong>April 2015 </strong>— minor update. The recommendations on the use of ezetimibe for the prevention of CVD have been amended to reflect recommendations in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline <em>Lipid modification: Cardiovascular risk assessment and the modification of blood lipids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease,</em> and the NICE technology appraisal <em>Ezetimibe for the treatment of primary (heterozygous-familial and non-familial) hypercholesterolaemia</em>.</p><p><strong>February 2015 </strong>— minor update. Typographical errors corrected in the topic.</p><p><strong>December 2014 </strong>— reviewed. The recommendations have been updated in line with recommendations in the revised NICE guideline <em>Lipid modification: Cardiovascular risk assessment and the modification of blood lipids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease</em>. Significant changes to the recommendations include advice on:</p><ul><li><strong>When to offer treatment for the prevention of CVD:</strong><ul><li>If there is no established CVD, lipid modification treatment should be:<ul><li>Offered to people aged 84 years and younger if their estimated 10-year risk of developing CVD using the QRISK<sup>®</sup>2 assessment tool is 10% or more.</li><li>Offered (without the need for a formal risk assessment) to people with type 1 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or familial hypercholesterolaemia.</li><li>Considered (without the need for a formal risk assessment) in people who are 85 years of age or older, taking into account the benefits and risks of treatment and any comorbidities that make treatment appropriate.</li></ul></li><li>For people who have established CVD, lipid modification therapy should be advised for the secondary prevention of CVD.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Lipid measurements: </strong>before starting lipid modification treatment for the prevention of CVD, at least one lipid sample should be taken to measure a full lipid profile. This should include measurement of total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. A fasting sample is <em>not </em>needed. The aim of treatment is to achieve a greater than 40% reduction in non-HDL cholesterol.</li><li><strong>Creatine kinase: </strong>this should not be checked in asymptomatic people being considered for statin treatment. It should only be checked if the person has persistent generalized unexplained muscle pain (whether associated with previous lipid-lowering therapy or not).</li><li><strong>Treatment to offer: </strong>high intensity statin treatment should be offered for the primary and secondary prevention of CVD. Atorvastatin 20 mg is recommended first line for the primary prevention of CVD. Atorvastatin 80 mg is recommended first line for secondary prevention of CVD, but a lower dose should be prescribed if there are adverse effects, increased risk of adverse effects, or if the person prefers a lower dose.</li><li><strong>Informed choice: </strong>the decision to start statin treatment should be made after an informed discussion with the person about the risks and benefits of treatment, taking into account factors such as co-morbidities, potential benefits from lifestyle intervention, the person's preference, and life expectancy.</li></ul><p><strong>June 2013 </strong>— minor update. The 2013 QOF options for local implementation have been added to this topic.</p><p><strong>February 2013 </strong>— minor update.

Removed the black triangle status from colesevelam as this is no longer a black triangle drug. Update to the text to reflect safety advice issued by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency for simvastatin.</p><p><strong>October 2012 </strong>— minor update. The 2012 QIPP options for local implementation have been added to this topic.</p><p><strong>June 2012 </strong>— minor update. Minor formatting error corrected.</p><p><strong>March 2012 </strong>— minor update. The 2012/2013 QOF indicators have been added to this topic. Issued in April 2012.</p><p><strong>January 2012 </strong>— minor update. Information from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) about the risk of hyperglycaemia and diabetes with statin use has been added.

Following the publication of the Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine (SEARCH) trial, the <em>Supporting evidence </em>section has been updated. Issued in December 2010.</p><p><strong>June 2010 </strong>— minor update. Following a review of the data from the Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine (SEARCH) trial, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has advised that simvastatin 80 mg should be considered only in patients with severe hypercholesterolaemia and high risk of cardiovascular complications who have not achieved their treatment goals on lower doses, when the benefits are expected to outweigh the potential risks. Issued in June 2010.</p><p><strong>November 2009 </strong>— minor update. Advice from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) that treatment with any statin may be associated with depression, sleep disturbances, memory loss, sexual dysfunction or, very rarely, interstitial lung disease has been added.

The evidence-base has been reviewed in detail, and recommendations are more clearly justified and transparently linked to the supporting evidence. The recommendations have been updated in line with guidance issued by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence on lipid modification. Significant changes to the recommendations include:</p><ul><li>For primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD):<ul><li>Repeat lipid measurement is unnecessary. A target for total or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is not recommended.</li></ul></li><li>For secondary prevention of CVD:<ul><li>The use of higher intensity lipid-modifying treatment (simvastatin 80 mg) is recommended if a target total cholesterol of less than 4 mmol/L or a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of less than 2 mmol/L has not been achieved.</li><li>Other higher intensity statin therapy (other than simvastatin 80 mg) is not recommended except for people with acute coronary syndrome (where the use of atorvastatin 80 mg is cost effective).</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>March 2008 </strong>— minor update. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued advice regarding several additional class adverse effects of statins.
