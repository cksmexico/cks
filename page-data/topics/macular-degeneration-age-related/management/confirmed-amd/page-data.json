Anti-VEGF therapies have become first-line therapy for treating and stabilizing most cases of neovascular AMD.  </li><li>Anti-VEGF drugs include ranibizumab (Lucentis®), bevacizumab (Avastin® – this is an off-label use), and aflibercept (Eylea®). </li><li>The anti-VEGF drugs are administered by intravitreal injection, usually given monthly for 3 months, and then at variable times thereafter, depending on response. Treatment and follow up may need to be continued for up to and beyond 2 years.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Older treatments have largely been superseded by anti-angiogenic therapies</strong> and are not usually recommended. However, they may have a role for some people. They include:<ul><li>Laser photocoagulation — this involves laser treatment to destroy the developing new blood vessels, to reduce further loss of vision. People undergoing this treatment will develop a permanent scotoma (black or grey patch affecting the field of vision). Laser photocoagulation can only be used for lesions that are not very close to the centre of the fovea. This is because of the risk of severe visual loss arising from laser damage or from the development of a laser scar.</li><li>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin — this may be used in combination with anti-VEGF therapy as a second-line treatment for late AMD (wet active). It involves laser treatment to lesions following intravenous injection of verteporfin. Verteporfin is selectively taken up by proliferating vascular endothelial cells, and subsequent activation by the laser induces specific lesion damage. The laser also results in thrombotic occlusion of the abnormally leaky blood vessels. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/macular-degeneration-age-related/references/\">Royal College of Ophthalmologists, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/macular-degeneration-age-related/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/macular-degeneration-age-related/references/\">AAO, 2019</a>]</p><!-- end field b7eda65b-fc56-4fa0-9517-7105acb5fd4b --><!-- end item 25c3ee9e-be9e-4ec2-833e-0a97ed51d690 -->","subChapters":[]},{"id":"4731d44e-ba9c-5d77-bc64-3df4b19affb0","slug":"basis-for-recommendation-db0","fullItemName":"Basis for recommendation","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 3da8ed43-d0d2-4e5a-a0ea-2771c8248b2f --><h4>Basis for recommendation</h4><!-- end field 3da8ed43-d0d2-4e5a-a0ea-2771c8248b2f -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item db0e0549-5c78-465d-bcd9-16aef7d23b57 --><!-- begin field b8bfb99c-05cd-4cd7-beae-4da74f7d9e19 --><p>These recommendations on primary care management are largely based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline <em>Age-related macular degeneration</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/macular-degeneration-age-related/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>]<em>,</em> the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCO) <em>Guidelines for the management of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/macular-degeneration-age-related/references/\">Royal College of Ophthalmologists, 2013</a>], and the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) guideline <em>Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/macular-degeneration-age-related/references/\">AAO, 2019</a>].</p><!-- end field b8bfb99c-05cd-4cd7-beae-4da74f7d9e19 --><!-- end item db0e0549-5c78-465d-bcd9-16aef7d23b57 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"f57a5341-b3dc-571a-9b7d-fbb707d53010","slug":"advice-on-slowing-progression","fullItemName":"Advice on slowing progression","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 76b6b460-203e-4707-901a-86376b420203 --><h3>What advice can I offer on slowing progression?</h3><!-- end field 76b6b460-203e-4707-901a-86376b420203 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item e20c4bad-a5d4-4068-a2bb-601102c19ca4 --><!-- begin field af283583-e5b9-40bf-9068-c47748fd07da --><ul><li><strong>Advise smokers to stop smoking </strong>as this reduces the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) progression in people with existing disease.

However, a number of case-control and population-based studies that examined the relationship between AMD, hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases showed conflicting results [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/macular-degeneration-age-related/references/\">AAO, 2019</a>]. </li><li>The BMJ best practice guide advises that people with AMD should be encouraged to stop smoking, eat a balanced diet, and to modify cardiovascular risk factors (including lowering cholesterol and saturated fat intake and controlling hypertension) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/macular-degeneration-age-related/references/\">BMJ, 2018</a>].</li><li>A pooled analysis of cross-sectional data of 30,953 participants in the E3 consortium and 1530 participants from the Rotterdam Study found that high circulating high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and low triglyceride levels are significantly associated with AMD and concluded that HDL cholesterol was associated with an increased risk of AMD and triglyceride levels negatively associated [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/macular-degeneration-age-related/references/\">Colijn, 2018</a>]. However, it is currently unclear how circulating lipids or lipid metabolism contribute to AMD [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/macular-degeneration-age-related/references/\">van Leeuwen, 2018</a>].</li><li>High blood pressure is associated with lower choroidal blood flow and disturbed vascular homeostasis, however, antihypertensive medication has not been proven to have a positive effect on AMD and while hypertension seems to play a role, it is unlikely to be a major contributor to the incidence and progression of AMD [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/macular-degeneration-age-related/references/\">Heesterbeek, 2020</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements</h5><ul><li>The AAO recommends that antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation should be considered in people with intermediate or advanced AMD in at least one eye. However, it states that there is no evidence to support the use of these supplements for patients who have less than intermediate AMD, and no evidence of any prophylactic value for family members without signs of AMD [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/macular-degeneration-age-related/references/\">AAO, 2019</a>]. <ul><li>The use of antioxidant vitamins, lutein, zeaxanthin, and zinc in an otherwise well-nourished population with intermediate AMD has been demonstrated to reduce the progression toward more advanced stages of AMD by approximately 25% at 5 years.</li></ul></li><li>A Cochrane systematic review of 19 studies that assessed the effects of antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplementation on the progression of AMD in people with AMD found that some people may experience modest delay in progression of the disease, although it states that this finding was largely drawn from one large trial (AREDS) conducted in a relatively well-nourished American population [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/macular-degeneration-age-related/references/\">Evans, 2017a</a>]. </li><li>A Cochrane systematic review of five randomized controlled trials that assessed whether or not taking antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplements, or both, prevents the development of AMD in people in the general population with or without diseases other than AMD, found that taking vitamin E or beta-carotene supplements does not prevent or delay the onset of AMD and there was no evidence for other antioxidant supplements, such as lutein and zeaxanthin [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/macular-degeneration-age-related/references/\">Evans, 2017b</a>].</li><li>The RCO advises that decreased serum, dietary, and retinal levels of lutein and zeaxanthin have been associated with an increased risk of AMD in some, but not all observational studies, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend lutein and zeaxanthin supplements to improve concentrations of macular pigment in the fundus [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/macular-degeneration-age-related/references/\">Royal College of Ophthalmologists, 2013</a>].</li><li>NICE does not make a recommendation for or against the use of antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements but made a research recommendation that the effectiveness of antioxidant and zinc supplements on AMD disease progression for people with early AMD at high risk of progression should be assessed in a randomized controlled trial [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/macular-degeneration-age-related/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field d9fe79a5-0287-4cf8-9764-6be66fb11586 --><!-- end item 1d508d02-fe3e-4eaf-9e64-cb41557c7147 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"370aaed7-10a7-51e2-b37e-52ad4caef28b","slug":"self-monitoring","fullItemName":"Self-monitoring","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field e616f328-8a3f-48f8-9c5c-ac5600f0e31c --><h3>What advice and support should I give a person with age-related macular degeneration about self-monitoring?</h3><!-- end field e616f328-8a3f-48f8-9c5c-ac5600f0e31c -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 1284816b-0ba1-4622-889c-073c7386201d --><!-- begin field a47c5438-91c5-40b7-aec6-ac5600f0e31c --><ul><li>Discuss self-monitoring with people with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and explain the strategies available (for example, Amsler grid or electronic home monitoring). <ul><li>An Amsler grid is a graph paper with a central dot for fixation.
