nose or gut of up to a third of the general population — it usually lives on intact skin harmlessly but can cause infection (most commonly skin, soft tissue, and bone infection) if invasion through the skin or deeper tissues occurs.</li><li>Meticillin resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) are strains of <em>S. aureus</em> which have developed resistance to a number of commonly used antibiotics.<ul><li>Healthcare associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) are strains of MRSA identified in people who have had contact with healthcare services — they can present in hospital or in the community.</li></ul></li><li>There are no clinical features specific to MRSA infection — MRSA can cause the same spectrum of disease as any other strain of <em>S. aureus</em> including:<ul><li>Skin and soft tissue infection (such as boils, folliculitis, impetigo, cellulitis and necrotising fasciitis).</li><li>Urinary tract infection.</li><li>Pneumonia and bronchiectasis.</li><li>Joint and bone infection (such as osteomyelitis and septic arthritis).</li><li>Sepsis and toxic shock syndrome.</li><li>Infective endocarditis.</li></ul></li><li>MRSA should be suspected in all people presenting with potential staphylococcal infection in particular if:<ul><li>They have risk factors for MRSA (such as recent hospitalization, previous MRSA infection or colonisation, nursing home contact, antibiotic use, chronic illness, surgical wounds, open ulcers, intravenous lines, or urinary catheters).</li><li>There is no response to first line antibiotics.</li><li>They have recurrent skin or soft tissue infections or a chronic non-healing ulcer.</li></ul></li><li>Diagnosis of MRSA is based on a thorough clinical assessment supported by confirmatory laboratory results from swabs of exudate (from lesions or wounds) or urine or sputum samples.</li><li>Appropriate infection control measures (in line with local policy) should be followed in all cases (whether a person is known to be infected or colonized with MRSA or not) along with careful communication between healthcare professionals.</li><li>Urgent assessment in secondary care should be arranged if a person has suspected or confirmed MRSA and clinical features of severe or complicated infection or they require surgical intervention.</li><li>Treatment of uncomplicated infections where MRSA is suspected or confirmed (such as antibiotics and wound care) should be discussed with a microbiologist or the local infection-control team.<ul><li>Routine treatment with oral or topical antibiotics is not advised, unless directed by microbiology.</li><li>Follow up (after 48 hours [or sooner if worsening]) is recommended to monitor for signs of complications (such as sepsis) and to ensure infection is resolving.</li></ul></li><li>Decolonization is not routinely required for asymptomatic carriers of MRSA in the community but may be indicated if the person has risk factors (such as a wound or invasive device, or is resident in a care home).</li></ul><!-- end field bfd4fd92-bc31-4b1a-ac60-5ef9df77c1d7 --><!-- end item 81cc2a26-a971-4038-a933-4595a848bbd1
