non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are largely based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline <em>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): assessment and management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>], the European Association for the Study of the Liver <em>EASL-EASD-EASO Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">EASL-EASD-EASO, 2016</a>], the World Gastroenterology Organisation Global Guidelines <em>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis</em>, which are based on selected position statements and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">World Gastroenterology Organisation, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">World Gastroenterology Organisation, 2014</a>]; expert opinion and a literature review in the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases practice guideline <em>The diagnosis and management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">Chalasani et al, 2012</a>]; a regional clinical guideline <em>Guidelines for management of adults with asymptomatic liver function abnormalities </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">Hudson and McPherson, 2014</a>], and expert opinion in review articles on NAFLD [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">Adams et al, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">Dyson et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">Sattar et al, 2014</a>].</p><h4>NAFLD is usually detected incidentally</h4><ul><li>The information that NAFLD is usually detected incidentally following liver blood tests or abdominal ultrasound scan is based on expert opinion in the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>].<strong> </strong>The EASL guideline also states that NAFLD is the main reason for unexpectedly elevated liver enzymes [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">EASL-EASD-EASO, 2016</a>].</li></ul><h4>Risk factors for NAFLD</h4><ul><li>The recommendation to suspect NAFLD if a person has risk factors is based on the fact that 70–90% of people with the metabolic syndrome have NAFLD, and metabolic syndrome is an independent predictor of liver fibrosis in people with NAFLD [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">Dyson et al, 2014</a>].</li><li>The NICE clinical guideline states that early detection of NAFLD may be useful to identify people with potentially silent progressive fatty liver disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>].</li><li>The NICE clinical guideline states that due to variation in cost-effectiveness of different imaging and non-invasive tests to diagnose NAFLD in adults, and the uncertainty in the evidence base for using non-invasive tests, the use of a specific diagnostic test to identify NAFLD in people with risk factors is not recommended [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>].</li></ul><h4>Persistent elevation of liver function tests (LFTs)</h4><ul><li>The recommendation on suspecting NAFLD if there is a persistent elevation of LFTs (particularly transaminases) for 3 months is based on a regional clinical guideline, which states that short-lived abnormal LFTs for a few weeks may be due to intercurrent illness which resolves [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">Hudson and McPherson, 2014</a>].</li><li>In NAFLD the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio is usually less than 1.0 [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">World Gastroenterology Organisation, 2012</a>]. A pattern of ALT exceeding AST may be helpful in differentiating NAFLD from alcoholic liver injury, where there is normally a high AST to ALT ratio of greater than 1.5 [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">Dyson et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">Sattar et al, 2014</a>].</li><li>In people with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), ALT levels typically fall and AST levels remain stable or increase, with a rise in the AST to ALT ratio as fibrosis progresses to cirrhosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">Dyson et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">Sattar et al, 2014</a>]. In 10% of people with NASH, however, ALT and AST levels may be normal [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">World Gastroenterology Organisation, 2012</a>].</li></ul><h4>Ultrasound findings of fatty liver changes</h4><ul><li>The recommendation to suspect NAFLD if there are changes on liver ultrasound scan are based on a number of clinical guidelines and review articles, however it is noted that ultrasound is operator-dependent and is insensitive in detecting NAFLD unless more than 33% of hepatocytes are steatotic [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">Adams et al, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">World Gastroenterology Organisation, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">Dyson et al, 2014</a>]. A normal liver appearance on ultrasound does not rule out mild fatty liver disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">Dyson et al, 2014</a>].</li><li>There are a number of additional limitations in the use of ultrasound to diagnose NAFLD and this is not a recommended approach. Ultrasound cannot distinguish NASH from simple steatosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">Sattar et al, 2014</a>], or NAFLD from alcoholic fatty liver disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">World Gastroenterology Organisation, 2012</a>]. There are technical difficulties of performing ultrasound in people who are obese [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">Sattar et al, 2014</a>], and the sensitivity and specificity of ultrasound for detecting fatty infiltration decreases as a person's body mass index increases, and varies from 49–100% and from 75–95% respectively [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">Adams et al, 2005</a>].</li><li>The NICE clinical guideline does not recommend the use of ultrasound as a diagnostic test if NAFLD is suspected, as this would require the referral of large numbers of people to secondary care, which would place an additional burden on ultrasound services [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>].</li></ul><h4>Not using routine liver blood tests to rule out NAFLD</h4><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the NICE guideline that although NAFLD is a very common cause of abnormal liver blood tests, more than 80% of people with NAFLD have normal routine liver blood tests. As a result, clinicians should not rely on liver blood tests to rule out NAFLD [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>].</li><li>LFTs do not correlate reliably with liver histology findings, and the full spectrum of NAFLD-associated liver disease may be seen in people with normal LFT results [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">Adams et al, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">Chalasani et al, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field f3bcf0ec-30ca-46ad-81e2-3eb4b4b4778e --><!-- end item 2ba5f2b1-dca6-4363-92e3-c27b5178c6dc -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
