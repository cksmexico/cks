This is also in line with the EASL clinical practice guidelines which state that identifying fibrosis is the most important prognostic factor in people with NAFLD, and is correlated with liver-related outcomes and mortality [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">EASL-EASD-EASO, 2016</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to consider using the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) test to assess the risk of advanced liver fibrosis and liver-related complications in people who need specialist referral is based on the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>].<ul><li>The ELF test was compared with a number of other blood tests and non-invasive fibrosis scores, as well as imaging modalities. NICE found the ELF test was the most clinically and cost-effective option, on the basis of evidence from a 'relatively small population'. It is a single blood test that can produce a quicker and slightly more accurate diagnosis of advanced liver fibrosis, compared with the NAFLD Fibrosis Score or the FIB-4 score.</li><li>The NICE clinical guideline does not recommend the use of routine liver blood tests to assess for advanced liver fibrosis in people with NAFLD, or a specific alternative approach for assessing the risk of advanced liver fibrosis if the ELF test is not available in primary care.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation on using another non-invasive scoring system to provide an indirect measure of fibrosis (for example, if the ELF test is not available in primary care) has been extrapolated from expert opinion in the EASL clinical practice guidelines, which state that the NAFLD Fibrosis Score and Fibrosis (FIB)-4 Score among others have been externally validated in different populations, with consistent results [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-nafld/references/\">EASL-EASD-EASO, 2016</a>].
