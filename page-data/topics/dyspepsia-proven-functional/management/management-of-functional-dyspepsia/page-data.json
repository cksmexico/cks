Quick reference guide for primary care: for consultation and local adaptation</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">PHE, 2016</a>] and the American College of Gastroenterology clinical guideline <em>Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">Chey, 2017</a>]. It is also based on a Cochrane systematic review <em>Proton pump inhibitors for functional dyspepsia</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">Pinto-Sanchez, 2017</a>], a systematic review and meta-analysis of <em>H. pylori</em> eradication therapy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">Du, 2016</a>] and expert opinion in review articles on dyspepsia [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">Ford, 2013</a>] and functional dyspepsia [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">Suzuki, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">Lu, 2016</a>].</p><h5>Assessing for any alarm symptoms</h5><ul><li>The recommendation on assessing for alarm symptoms and managing appropriately is based on the NICE clinical guideline <em>Suspected cancer: recognition and referral</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">NICE, 2015</a>].</li></ul><h5>Advice on lifestyle modification</h5><ul><li>The NICE clinical guideline states that there is limited or inconclusive evidence from small trials on the benefits of lifestyle modification to reduce dyspepsia symptoms, however expert opinion from the guideline development group recommended these measures as they encourage self-management of dyspepsia and may have more general health benefits [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>].<ul><li>Smoking increases gastric acid output and delays gastric emptying, which may be involved in the development of functional dyspepsia.</li><li>Alcohol can cause direct injury to the gastric mucosa and can potentially contribute to functional dyspepsia symptoms, however trial evidence suggests it is unlikely to have an important role.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Managing associated stress and anxiety</h5><ul><li>The recommendation on assessing for and managing associated stress, anxiety, and depression is largely based on the NICE recommendation to offer psychological treatments to people with functional dyspepsia, as this may reduce symptoms in the short-term [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>].<ul><li>NICE cites evidence from three small trials of group therapy, individual cognitive therapy, and psychodynamic therapy that there was a statistically significant decrease in dyspepsia symptoms at the end of each intervention at 3 months, but the benefits did not persist at one year follow-up. It concluded that psychological therapies are of uncertain benefit in primary care.</li></ul></li><li>This is supported by expert opinion in a review article on dyspepsia, which states that people with functional dyspepsia have higher rates of anxiety and depression than the general population, and despite the lack of evidence for benefit, it is reasonable to consider psychological treatments for people who have co-existent anxiety or depression [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">Ford, 2013</a>].</li><li>A systematic review and meta-analysis on the use of antidepressants for functional dyspepsia similarly found that people with functional dyspepsia are more likely to have co-morbid anxiety, and are more depressed over long-term follow-up than healthy controls [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">Lu, 2016</a>].</li></ul><h5>Reviewing the person's medication</h5><ul><li>The recommendation on self-treating with antacid and/or alginate therapy is extrapolated from NICE recommendations on the management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), as there is evidence that antacids are no more effective than placebo in treating functional dyspepsia symptoms [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>].<ul><li>NICE noted that antacid and/or alginate medication is often prescribed by primary healthcare professionals, and is often used as over-the-counter medication. It may provide short-term symptom relief, but does not prevent dyspepsia symptoms.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation on considering reducing or stopping a variety of drugs that may cause or exacerbate dyspepsia symptoms is based on expert opinion in the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>] and expert opinion in a review article on dyspepsia [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">Ford, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h5>Testing for <em>Helicobacter pylori </em>infection</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on using the carbon-13 urea breath test or stool antigen test for <em>H. pylori</em> detection in primary care is based on the consensus opinion of the NICE guideline development group [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>], consensus opinion in the Maastricht V/Florence Consensus Report [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">Malfertheiner, 2017</a>], and expert opinion in the PHE publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">PHE, 2016</a>].<ul><li>NICE found urea breath tests and stool antigen tests to be consistently accurate with about 95% sensitivity and specificity reported in studies [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to avoid antibiotics and PPIs prior to testing is due to the fact that these drugs can suppress <em>H. pylori</em> and therefore lead to false negative results [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">PHE, 2016</a>].</li><li>NICE and the Maastricht V/Florence Consensus Report noted the poor positive predictive value of serological testing in populations with a low prevalence of <em>H. pylori</em>. In addition, serological testing cannot differentiate active infection from previous infection, resulting in an at least two-fold false positive rate compared with urea breath tests and stool antigen tests [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>]. This may result in potential over-treatment with eradication regimens and associated increased costs of treatment and increased antibiotic resistance rates [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">Malfertheiner, 2017</a>].</li><li>Overall, the NICE guideline development group did not feel that serological testing performed adequately when compared with laboratory-based urea breath tests and stool antigen tests [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>]. In addition, serological test performance is dependent on the regional antigenic composition of the circulating strains of <em>H. pylori</em>, so if used, only locally validated tests are recommended [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">Malfertheiner, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Offering first-line <em>H. pylori</em> eradication therapy</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on first-line <em>H. pylori</em> eradication regimens are largely based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>] and the PHE document, which reviewed the evidence cited by NICE [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">PHE, 2016</a>].</li><li>The NICE clinical guideline states that <em>H. pylori </em>eradication is an effective and cost-effective option in people with functional dyspepsia. It is associated with a small but statistically significant benefit for symptom control over no eradication (estimated number needed to treat [NNT] of 14), which potentially avoids the need for long-term acid suppression therapy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>].<ul><li>NICE examined 12 RCTs (n = 2903) of 3–12 months duration, which found <em>H. pylori</em> eradication was more effective than placebo at reducing dyspepsia symptoms.

There were, however, methodological limitations which affected the interpretation of results.</li><li>NICE recommends the use of low-dose PPIs first-line on the basis of the trial evidence, that found full-dose PPIs were no more effective in reducing dyspepsia symptoms.</li><li>The recommendation to consider switching to an alternative acid suppression therapy is extrapolated from the NICE clinical guideline recommendations to offer an H<sub>2</sub>RA if there is an inadequate response to a PPI for people with uninvestigated dyspepsia, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), or recurrent dyspepsia after healing of peptic ulcer disease, as individual people may respond better to H<sub>2</sub>RA therapy. This is supported by the expert opinion of previous external reviewers of this CKS topic.</li><li>The PHE document states that in people with functional dyspepsia and no family history of malignancy or peptic ulcer disease, a maintenance PPI may be appropriate.</li></ul></li><li>This is supported by a subsequent Cochrane systematic review of 23 randomized controlled trials (RCTs, n = 8759) of the use of PPIs for functional dyspepsia, which found moderate-quality evidence that 2–8 weeks of PPI therapy was slightly more effective than placebo at relieving functional dyspepsia symptoms. It also found low-quality evidence that PPIs may be slightly more effective than H<sub>2</sub>RAs at relieving symptoms. Low-dose PPIs had similar efficacy to standard-dose PPIs [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">Pinto-Sanchez, 2017</a>].</li></ul><h5>Stepping down or stopping treatment</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on stepping down or stopping acid suppression treatment are based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>].<ul><li>The recommendation on using the lowest effective PPI dose to control symptoms is to reduce the risks of adverse effects associated with long-term PPI use, and is considered a more cost-effective option than continuous PPI use.</li><li>The recommendation to use a PPI as needed, if possible, is extrapolated from evidence on the management of people with endoscopy-negative reflux disease that found this is a cost-effective option to promote patient self-management of their condition.</li><li>The recommendation on self-treating with antacid and/or alginate therapy is extrapolated from NICE recommendations on the management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), as there is evidence that antacids are no more effective than placebo in treating functional dyspepsia symptoms.<ul><li>NICE noted that antacid and/or alginate medication is often prescribed by primary healthcare professionals, and is often used as over-the-counter medication. It may provide short-term symptom relief, but does not prevent dyspepsia symptoms.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h5>Arranging specialist referral</h5><ul><li><p>The recommendations on arranging referral to a gastroenterologist for a specialist opinion are largely based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-functional/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>].
