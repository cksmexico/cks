Morbidity can be severe, with severity compounded by delays in seeking healthcare in response to the initial symptoms. Mortality can occur from invasive infections resulting in sepsis, bacteraemia or necrotizing fasciitis. Meticillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> is often reported. In England in 2017, of reported cases of meticillin-sensitive <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>(MSSA) and meticillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) with risk factor information, 14% (410/2,877) of the MSSA bacteraemias were associated with injecting drug use, and 11% (40/348) of the MRSA bacteraemias.</li><li><strong>HIV</strong> — prevalence among injecting drug users in 2017 was 1.7% in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and among those attending needle and syringe programmes in Scotland during 2015-16, 1.9%. </li><li><strong>Hepatitis B </strong>— the proportion of people in the UK who inject drugs who have ever been infected with hepatitis B has fallen over the last decade from 20% in 2007 to 16% in 2017. </li><li><strong>Hepatitis C </strong>— this is the most common blood-borne infection among people who inject drugs. Around half of injecting drug users in the UK are infected with hepatitis. There is a marked regional variation in the prevalence of hepatitis C: 52% in England, 23% in Northern Ireland, 58% in Scotland and 50% in Wales. </li><li><strong>Clostridium infections </strong>—<strong> </strong>such infections are associated with injecting into the skin or muscle (a technique known as 'popping'). </li><li><strong>Bacillus anthracis (anthrax)</strong> — this is rare but potentially fatal. There were no confirmed cases among drug users in 2017. </li><li><strong>Tuberculosis </strong>— there is a greater prevalence of tuberculosis among people who use drugs compared with the general population.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli </strong>— these are more prevalent amongst people who use drugs.<ul><li><strong>Superficial thrombophlebitis</strong><strong>:</strong><ul><li>Dependent users are susceptible to superficial thrombophlebitis because of repetitive trauma, unsterilized techniques, and irritation caused by the drug mixtures.</li><li>Street drugs are often cut with substances that promote thrombosis (for example, lactose, sucrose, dextrose).</li><li>Cocaine, in particular, seems to promote thrombosis.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Venous and arterial thrombosis</strong> can result from poor injecting technique, especially in people injecting into the groin. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Poor nutrition and dental disease </strong>— people who have a history of substance use problems are more likely to have poorer oral and dental health, and may suffer from poor nutrition. </li><li><strong>Social problems, including:</strong><ul><li>Crime — it is estimated that half of all recorded crime is drug related. </li><li>Imprisonment.</li><li>Effect on partner and children including child protection issues.</li><li>Deprivation and social exclusion.</li><li>Involvement in the sex trade.</li><li>Homelessness.</li><li>Loss of driving licence. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Psychological problems, including: </strong><ul><li>Craving and fear of withdrawal.</li><li>Guilt.</li><li>Anxiety. </li><li>Loss of memory or cognitive skills.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">Samlaska, 1990</a>;
