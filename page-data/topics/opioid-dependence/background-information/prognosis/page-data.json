With effective treatment, relapse rates are similar to those in other chronic medical illnesses, such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. </li><li>The mortality risk of people dependent on illicit diamorphine is around 12 times that of the general population. </li><li>People with other coexisting conditions have a poorer prognosis, for example:  <ul><li>Mental health problems. </li><li>Cognitive impairment.</li></ul></li><li>Of 121,332 people who exited the drug and alcohol treatment system in England in 2017–2018, 48% (58,718) successfully completed treatment and were free from dependence. However, people treated for opioid use had the lowest rate of successful exits at 26% compared to others taking non-opioids or alcohol. <ul><li>A large proportion of the opioid users in treatment have entrenched long-term drug use, are often in ill health and less likely to have access to the personal and social resources that can aid recovery, such as employment and stable housing. This often results in them being less likely to complete treatment successfully or sustain their recovery, when compared to people who use other drugs, or only alcohol. </li><li>1712 people in the opioid group died in treatment (1.2% of the opioid group) — the median age of was 45 and 77% were male. </li></ul></li><li>In 2017 in England, the number of deaths from drug misuse decreased by 3.2% to 2310 — the first decrease since 2012 after increases of 3.7% between 2015 and 2016, 8.5% between 2014 and 2015 and 17% between 2013 and 2014.<ul><li>The number of registered heroin deaths decreased by 3.7% from 1209 (the highest number on record) in 2016, to 1164 in 2017.  </li></ul></li><li>A longitudinal data collection project in the US found that the average time from the first to the last episode of opioid use was 9.9 years, with 40% of people addicted for over 12 years [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">Joe et al, 1990</a>].</li><li>A long-term follow-up study of 581 male opioid users in the US found that after 24 years, 29% were abstinent, 28% had died, 23% had positive urine tests for opioids, and 18% were in prison [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">Hser et al, 1993</a>].</li><li>A quarter to a third of those entering drug treatment are able to achieve long-term abstinence [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">Gossop et al, 2001</a>].</li><li>A cautious conclusion, made after members of the Recovery Orientated Drug Treatment Expert Group had reviewed the available literature, was that among survivors of people who had used heroin, 40% eventually attain stable remission (over one or two decades) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">Strang, 2012</a>].</li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>;
