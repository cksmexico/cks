opioids.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Discuss detoxification treatment, including:</strong><ul><li>The goal — to come off opioids altogether.</li><li>Suitability — detoxification is suitable for people

stable dose and is progressing in treatment.<ul><li>Social factors should be taken into account (for example, whether the person has a job or childcare responsibilities) — entering employment often leads to the biggest psychosocial improvement in a person's life and for some people is a good time to switch to non-supervised consumption.

However, if injected, naloxone has high bioavailability and can precipitate withdrawal, thereby discouraging misuse by injection. </li><li>Buprenorphine is also available as a prolonged-release injection (Buvidal) — it is administered weekly or monthly by a healthcare professional. </li></ul></li><li>Methadone is more effective in retaining people in treatment and so may indirectly reduce risks longer term.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Decide what treatment to start after a discussion with the person, taking into account:</strong> <ul><li>Their pre-existing preference for either drug.</li><li>The potential value of rapid induction onto effective maintenance over an induction phase that has been assessed as particularly high risk (considered specifically achievable with buprenorphine).</li><li>Previous substantial benefit from maintenance on either medicine.</li><li>Specific safety concerns (for example, with methadone, potential diversion or previous overdose on it; and, with buprenorphine, previous early disengagement from treatment).</li><li>The likely need for strong opioids other than buprenorphine for acute pain management (for example, with pending surgery) or for chronic pain management.</li><li>Any relevant drug-drug interactions.</li><li>Local pragmatic factors, such as lack of geographical availability of supervised consumption (which may favour buprenorphine).</li></ul></li><li><strong>For people who wish to: </strong><ul><li><strong>Stop using heroin completely</strong> — high-dose methadone or buprenorphine may be more suitable as the blockade effects of both interfere with the subjective effects of additional heroin use.</li><li><strong>Continue to use some heroin</strong> — low-dose methadone treatment may be preferred.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Methadone may be more suitable for people who use large amounts of heroin,</strong> as they do not appear to settle as well on high dose buprenorphine as they do on high dose methadone.</li><li><strong>Buprenorphine may be the preferred option in</strong><strong> people who:</strong><ul><li>Have experienced unwanted effects or difficulties with methadone currently or in the past. </li><li>Prefer the 'clear head' response often reported with buprenorphine, in contrast to the 'clouding' sometimes associated with methadone or heroin use. </li><li>Are on long-term treatment with drugs that either induce or inhibit liver enzymes (such as anticonvulsants, rifampicin, ribavirin), as it is less affected by these liver enzymes than methadone.

2017</a>]</h5><ul><li>Naloxone is a potentially life-saving medicine when used in settings associated with opiate misuse and overdose. Systematic reviews conclude that pre-provision of naloxone to heroin users can be helpful in reversing heroin overdoses. There is also evidence for the effectiveness of training family members or peers in how to administer the drug.</li><li>Naloxone is a prescription-only medicine, however it can be provided by \"Persons employed or engaged in the provision of drug treatment services provided by, on behalf of or under arrangements made by one of the following bodies: an NHS body; a local authority; Public Health England, or Public Health Agency”, as well as pharmacists commissioned to provide services for people who use drugs such as needle and syringe programmes.</li></ul><h5>Choosing between methadone or buprenorphine</h5><ul><li>A NICE technology appraisal concluded that the decision about which drug to use should be made on a case by case basis and should consider a number of clinical and patient factors, including the person's history of opioid dependence, their commitment to a particular long-term management strategy and an estimate of the risks and benefits. However, as methadone is cheaper, then if both drugs are equally suitable for a person, methadone should be prescribed as first choice [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">NICE, 2014</a>].  </li><li>DH states that there is insufficient evidence to justify recommending one drug over the other and there is no simple formula that can be recommended to determine whether methadone or buprenorphine is most suitable when choosing an appropriate opioid substitute for heroin dependence [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">DH, 2017</a>]. <ul><li>The evidence base for choosing an opioid substitute for people who are dependent on an opioid other than heroin is limited. DH advises that clinicians take into account the potency of the problem opioids and context of use (such as over-the-counter codeine or prescribed dihydrocodeine), evidence of severity of dependence, risks involved such as injecting, other comorbid conditions (including pain management), patient acceptability, treatment goal and other factors, and the limits of the evidence base should be discussed and a clinical judgement made with the patient. If an opioid is prescribed ‘off label’, local policies on the use of unlicensed and off label medicines should be followed. </li></ul></li><li>A Cochrane systematic review found that buprenorphine was more effective than clonidine or lofexidine at reducing the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, retaining people in withdrawal treatment, and in supporting the completion of withdrawal treatment. It also found, with limited data, that buprenorphine and methadone in tapered doses appear to have similar efficacy in managing opioid withdrawal [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">Gowing, 2017</a>].  </li><li>CRISM recommends initiating maintenance therapy on buprenorphine/naloxone and using methadone if that is not suitable or appropriate, as while both are equally efficacious in the treatment of pharmaceutical opioid-dependent individuals, buprenorphine/naloxone has a lower risk of [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">CRISM, 2018</a>]:<ul><li>Overdose.</li><li>Public safety harms if diverted.</li><li>Toxicity and drug-drug interaction.</li></ul></li><li>Buprenorphine is safer in overdose, but only when used alone — gastrointestinal bioavailability of buprenorphine is poor, and swallowing the tablets results in a milder effect compared with sublingual administration. It also has a ceiling effect, which adds to its safety in accidental or intentional overdose. However, it can be injected, and so is liable to abuse, and buprenorphine supervision in the pharmacy may be difficult, as a sublingual tablet will usually take 5–10 minutes to dissolve, but may take as little as 2–3 minutes [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">Ford et al, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">SAMHSA, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">ABPI, 2019a</a>].  <ul><li>Supervision is most important in the first 2–3 minutes, during which time the tablets will have started to dissolve, and their value for diversion (i.e. their street price) will decrease.</li><li>Crushing the tablets before administration may reduce the supervision time. However, crushing the sublingual tablet of buprenorphine will render the product unlicensed, as it is outside the manufacturer's marketing authorization, and there is the potential for the product's bioavailability to be distorted.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Prolonged-release buprenorphine injection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">NICE, 2019b</a>]</h5><ul><li>Buprenorphine prolonged-release injection (Buvidal) has recently been granted a license for treating opioid dependence within a framework of medical, social and psychological treatment in people aged 16 years and over. Evidence from one randomised controlled trial in 428 adults diagnosed with, and seeking treatment for, moderate to severe opioid use disorder found that [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">Lofwall, 2018</a>]: <ul><li>It was non-inferior to sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone tablets for the mean percentage of opioid-negative urine samples during weeks 1 to 24 — 35.1% for buprenorphine prolonged-release injection compared with 28.4% for sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone tablets; treatment difference 6.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.1% to 13.6%, p<0.001.</li><li>It was non-inferior to sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone tablets for the responder rate (a responder had no evidence of illicit opioid use at most assessments over 24 weeks) — 17.4% for buprenorphine prolonged-release injection compared with 14.4% for sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone; treatment difference 3.0%, 95% CI −4.0% to 9.9%, p<0.001.  </li></ul></li><li>The recommendation that prolonged-release buprenorphine injection should only be prescribed after specialist assessment is pragmatic and is what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.   </li></ul><h5>Injectable opioid treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">DH, 2017</a>]</h5><ul><li>Evidence supports the value of targeted injectable opioid treatment programmes and systematic reviews have shown it is cost effective. </li></ul><h5>Follow up [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">DH, 2017</a>]</h5><ul><li>Safe and effective provision of opioid substitution therapy, particularly in the early stages of treatment, can be best delivered by frequent attendance at the pharmacy and at the service for prescribing reviews, support and keyworking. Using regular appointments to provide opportunistic interventions (such as hepatitis interventions, injecting equipment, and overdose and naloxone training) can be crucial to maximise engagement in potentially life-saving interventions.</li><li>More stable people, who do not have a clinical need for such frequent attendance, can be over-treated or over-supervised. This can have a detrimental effect on their ability to return to, or sustain, a more conventional or stable lifestyle. There will be some stable people who still feel they benefit from the structure of close supervision.
