The metabolism of methadone is increased in the third trimester of pregnancy and it may occasionally be necessary to increase the dose or split it, from once-daily consumption to twice-daily consumption, or both.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Morning sickness</strong> <strong>may lead to the vomiting of methadone</strong> soon after it is swallowed and may lead to maternal and fetal withdrawal.<ul><li>If a methadone dose is vomited by a woman: <ul><li>Within 10 minutes of dosing — consider giving a repeat dose.</li><li>Within 10-30 minutes of dosing — consider giving half a repeat dose.</li><li>More than 30 minutes after dosing — consider giving half a repeat dose only if withdrawal occurs.</li><li>Consider if the entire dose is likely to have been vomited.</li><li>If there is doubt — assess the woman (or refer to an experienced clinician) 4–6 hours after vomiting when the effects of methadone should be at their peak, to determine whether an additional small dose is required.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Encourage breastfeeding in woman who are stable on OST </strong>unless there are other medical contraindications: <ul><li>Using high-dose benzodiazepines.</li><li>Using cocaine/crack.</li><li>HIV positive.</li></ul></li><li>Methadone or buprenorphine treatment is not a contraindication to breastfeeding and breastfeeding may reduce the intensity and length of NAS and has been shown to improve outcomes. </li></ul><!-- end field 5c60ccce-3ca1-4f3b-8a1e-a75a00a4fd1d --><!-- end item 43e79332-9e5a-49e1-be1a-a75a00a4fba7 -->","subChapters":[{"id":"19db8647-bf30-5d2e-b9ec-153e2133aa34","slug":"basis-for-recommendation-623","fullItemName":"Basis for recommendation","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field e3e7cfc8-dd8a-4ece-bd82-a75a00a4fd21 --><h4>Basis for recommendation</h4><!-- end field e3e7cfc8-dd8a-4ece-bd82-a75a00a4fd21 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 62340f53-06a2-4b4f-91f7-a75a00a4fd21 --><!-- begin field 7dd39225-e125-4469-9df6-a75a00a4fd21 --><p>These recommendations are based on the Royal College of General Practitioners' (RCGP) <em>Guidance for the use of substitute prescribing in the treatment of opioid dependence in primary care</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">Ford et al, 2011</a>], the Department of Health and the devolved administrations' guideline<em> Drug misuse and dependence: UK Guidelines on Clinical Management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">DH, 2017</a>], the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) <em>Pregnancy and complex social factors: a model for service provision for pregnant women with complex social factors</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>], the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline <em>Guidelines for the identification and management of substance use and substance use disorders in pregnancy</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">WHO, 2014</a>], the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (RCPI) guideline <em>Methadone prescribing and administration in pregnancy</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">RCPI, 2013</a>], a personal communication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">Ford, Personal Communication, 2014</a>], and what CKS consider good clinical practice.</p><h5>Offering referral [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">DH, 2017</a>]</h5><ul><li>Outcomes in opioid-dependent pregnant women are better, both in terms of the pregnancy and the outcomes for the neonate, for women who enter methadone treatment programmes during pregnancy and cease illicit drug use, than for those who do not. </li><li>Women attending treatment services usually have better antenatal care and better general health than drug-using women not in treatment, even if they are still using illicit drugs. </li></ul><h5>Maintenance preferred over detoxification </h5><ul><li>The WHO states that while maintenance therapy includes a risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal symptoms, opioids are essentially non-toxic at stable levels. Cessation of opioids however, carries a higher risk of relapse to unstable patterns of short-acting opioid use (such as heroin). The decision, therefore, is between an approach with a known risk of neonatal withdrawal but a low risk of relapse, and opioid detoxification, which, if successful, carries no risk of neonatal withdrawal, but, if unsuccessful, has a high risk of adverse neonatal outcomes, including neonatal opioid withdrawal and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and also adverse maternal outcomes such as overdose [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">WHO, 2014</a>]. </li><li>Maintenance treatment of methadone or buprenorphine has the advantage that the foetus receives a regular amount of drugs [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">Ford, Personal Communication, 2014</a>].

When methadone substitution is continued, a fully breastfed infant who has already been exposed in utero to opioids or methadone is likely to develop fewer withdrawal symptoms after birth than one who is not breastfed.</li><li>Buprenorphine is also excreted in breastmilk, and research has shown that it is poorly absorbed by infants via the oral route. However, breastfeeding should be encouraged in women maintained on buprenorphine because of the benefits to infants and mother-child interaction, the potential risks to the infant should also be borne in mind.</li></ul><!-- end field 7dd39225-e125-4469-9df6-a75a00a4fd21 --><!-- end item 62340f53-06a2-4b4f-91f7-a75a00a4fd21 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"99843550-c531-5750-80f1-d9ae3de3f5cd","slug":"travelling-abroad-on-substitution-therapy","fullItemName":"Travelling abroad on substitution therapy","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 2d735884-4744-4e92-8b8e-a74d0096ffb7 --><h3>What advice should I give someone who is travelling abroad?</h3><!-- end field 2d735884-4744-4e92-8b8e-a74d0096ffb7 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 768dacab-5a05-4c94-ae94-a74d0096ffb7 --><!-- begin field e30b38cd-622f-44da-9fb7-a74d0096ffb7 --><ul><li><strong>Advise all travellers that all controlled drugs (Schedules 2, 3 and 4 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 [as amended]) should</strong>:<ul><li>Be carried in their original packaging.</li><li>Be carried with a letter from the prescribing doctor confirming the person's name, destination, drug details, and quantities.</li><li>Meet the carriers requirements for hand and hold luggage (for example, restriction on volume of liquids in hand luggage).
