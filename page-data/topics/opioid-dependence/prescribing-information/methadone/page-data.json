For example, 120 mg methadone is equivalent to 360–600 mg of injectable diamorphine. </li><li>Buprenorphine is a partial agonist and there is no linear dosage relationship between buprenorphine and methadone — for maintenance doses, 50–80 mg methadone is approximately equivalent to 12–16 mg buprenorphine in terms of effectiveness.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">Ford et al, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">DH, 2017</a>]</p><!-- end field 5b91ffe7-b3ad-4748-988b-a75c0075cf66 --><!-- end item 3dcdc47e-27d1-4585-82ad-a75c0075c75f -->","subChapters":[]},{"id":"de43c9eb-0669-5b0d-a6d8-e93381de1d9f","slug":"dose","fullItemName":"Dose","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 81066997-2191-4072-abd7-a74d0097f182 --><h3>Maintenance treatment with methadone</h3><!-- end field 81066997-2191-4072-abd7-a74d0097f182 -->","summary":"","htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 8c963606-ef01-4261-b68d-a74d0097f0a9 --><!-- begin field ab24c805-b043-44e8-9cab-a74d0097f182 --><ul><li>When starting methadone, 'start low, go slow' and explain to the person why it is important to be cautious during dose induction (for example to avoid overdose).

This should not exceed 10 mg. </li><li>It is extremely important to provide adequate information to carers (after obtaining consent from the person who uses drugs) about how to recognize and manage methadone toxicity. Note that the steady state concentration of methadone takes about 3–10 days to become established. During this time blood levels rise progressively even if the person remains on the same dose. This means that a dose tolerated on day one may become a toxic dose on day three. </li></ul><h4>Splitting doses</h4><ul><li>Some people are more comfortable taking split doses. If a person is entering withdrawal before their next dose is due, it might be more effective to split the dose rather than increase it. Seek specialist advice if unsure. Split dosing can cause problems with supervised consumption. The following may benefit from split dosing:<ul><li>People on low doses.</li><li>Women in the third trimester of pregnancy.</li><li>People on enzyme-inducing medication (for example, anticonvulsants).</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">Ford et al, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">DH, 2017</a>]</p><!-- end field ab24c805-b043-44e8-9cab-a74d0097f182 --><!-- end item 8c963606-ef01-4261-b68d-a74d0097f0a9 -->","subChapters":[]},{"id":"4f0e3fd3-ac5f-5ab8-98d8-ae6a28bd6fe1","slug":"contraindications-cautions","fullItemName":"Contraindications and cautions","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 3af63b78-87f4-46a6-bedc-a74d00983ba2 --><h3>Contraindications and cautions</h3><!-- end field 3af63b78-87f4-46a6-bedc-a74d00983ba2 -->","summary":"","htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item a59fe473-edf1-479e-af82-a74d00983a73 --><!-- begin field b243a95a-fa30-471c-9ac3-a74d00983ba2 --><ul><li><strong>Do not prescribe methadone to people who:</strong><ul><li>Are non-opioid dependent. </li><li>Have allergy or proven intolerance to either methadone or buprenorphine. </li><li>Have severe liver disease — although, in many cases, careful monitoring of liver function outweighs the risks.</li><li>Have phaeochromocytoma. </li><li>Are under 16 years of age (except on the advice of a specialist).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Prescribe methadone with caution to people who have:</strong><ul><li>A history of cardiac conduction abnormalities.</li><li>A family history of sudden cardiac death.</li><li>Chronic pain.</li><li>Medical conditions, such as:<ul><li>Recent head injury.</li><li>Acute abdominal condition.</li><li>Severe respiratory disease.</li></ul></li><li>Severe mental illness — they may have limited capacity to provide informed consent.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">Ford et al, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/references/\">Joint Formulary Committee, 2019</a>]</p><!-- end field b243a95a-fa30-471c-9ac3-a74d00983ba2 --><!-- end item a59fe473-edf1-479e-af82-a74d00983a73 -->","subChapters":[]},{"id":"8029d652-57a0-59e4-bafb-df6cd34d5094","slug":"adverse-effects","fullItemName":"Adverse effects","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 90b2a648-6780-420e-9ea9-a74d0098574f --><h3>Adverse effects</h3><!-- end field 90b2a648-6780-420e-9ea9-a74d0098574f -->","summary":"","htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 6790cd47-9029-467d-8661-a74d0098562c --><!-- begin field c3c4c042-0b4c-4d3d-abd8-a74d0098574f --><ul><li>Adverse effects include: <ul><li>Asthma exacerbation. </li><li>Drowsiness.</li><li>Dry eye.</li><li>Dysuria. </li><li>Galactorrhoea.</li><li>Hyperprolactinaemia. </li><li>Hypothermia.</li><li>Menstrual cycle irregularities. </li><li>Mood changes, hallucinations, confusion.</li><li>Nasal dryness.</li><li>Nausea, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth.</li><li>QT-interval prolongation and torsades de pointes (particularly at high doses of more than 100 mg/day).<ul><li>People at increased risk of QT-interval prolongation (for example, those with heart or liver disease, electrolyte abnormalities, concomitant treatment with CYP 3A4 inhibitors or medicines with the potential to cause QT-interval prolongation) and people requiring more than 100 mg methadone per day should have their ECG closely monitored.
