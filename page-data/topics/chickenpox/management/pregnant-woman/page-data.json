in a guideline from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) that lists features of potentially life-threatening chickenpox which are indications for hospital admission<strong> </strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">RCOG, 2015</a>]<strong>, </strong>and<strong> </strong>absolute indicators for hospital admission listed in a guideline from the Health Protection Agency (HPA): <em>Guidance on Viral Rash in Pregnancy</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">HPA, 2011</a>].</li></ul><h5>Seeking immediate specialist advice regarding further management</h5><ul><li>CKS recommends seeking immediate specialist advice regarding the management of a pregnant woman with chickenpox because a pregnant woman is at increased risk of developing serious complications, is more likely to require hospitalisation, and needs to be assessed and counselled regarding the risk of fetal varicella syndrome.<ul><li>Pregnant women are more at risk of serious complications of varicella (for example fulminating varicella pneumonia). This risk is greatest in the second, and early in the third, trimester<strong> </strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">PHE, 2015</a>].</li><li>Guidelines from the Health Protection Agency: <em>Guidance on viral rash in pregnancy </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">HPA, 2011</a>]<em> </em>and the RCOG [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">RCOG, 2015</a>]<em> </em>list other features that may contribute to the need for hospitalisation, including difficulty monitoring the woman; gestation in the latter half of pregnancy; complicated obstetric history; history of smoking or chronic lung disease; poor social circumstances; and the use of systemic corticosteroids in the last 3 months.</li><li>The RCOG guideline on chickenpox in pregnancy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">RCOG, 2015</a>] advises that a pregnant woman needs to be informed of the small risk of fetal varicella syndrome and its implications if she develops varicella or shows serological conversion in the first 28 weeks of pregnancy. </li></ul></li></ul><h5>Primary care management</h5><ul><li>CKS recommends that oral antiviral treatment should only be prescribed in primary care on the advice of a specialist as there are limited data on the treatment of chickenpox in pregnancy. An analysis of the available evidence by the UK Teratology Information Service found that data on outcomes other than congenital malformation in pregnant women with exposure to aciclovir was insufficient to exclude an increased risk [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">UKTIS, 2015</a>].<ul><li>Guidance on the management of rash illness in pregnancy from the HPA and RCOG guidelines on chickenpox in pregnancy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">HPA, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">RCOG, 2015</a>] recommend offering a 7-day course of oral aciclovir (with informed consent following a discussion with an obstetrician) if the woman presents within 24 hours of the onset of the chickenpox rash and is 20 weeks pregnant or more. This is based on a consensus decision from the UK Advisory Group on Chickenpox that, considering the available evidence and the increased risk of pneumonitis in the latter half of pregnancy, the risk balance is in favour of giving oral aciclovir to women in the second half of pregnancy presenting within 24 hours of rash onset [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">Nathwani et al, 1998</a>]. The RCOG guideline also states that the use of aciclovir in pregnancy is off-label, therefore a discussion with the woman should include the risks and potential benefits [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">RCOG, 2015</a>].</li><li>If the woman is less than 20 weeks pregnant the HPA and RCOG state that aciclovir should be considered with caution [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">HPA, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">RCOG, 2015</a>]. </li></ul></li><li>The recommendation to offer symptomatic treatment and give advice is based on expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">Gould, 2014</a>;

Paracetamol was recommended as the preferred alternative treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">UKMi, 2016</a>]. <ul><li>The risk of skin reactions in adults with chickenpox using NSAIDs is unclear as most of the available trials involved children [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">UKMi, 2016</a>]. Until further evidence is available, CKS recommends avoiding NSAIDs such as ibuprofen in adults with chickenpox, in line with expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">Gould, 2014</a>].</li></ul></li><li>In addition, in pregnancy, exposure to high doses of NSAIDs after 30 weeks of gestation is associated with an increased risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus and oligohydramnios [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">UKTIS, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h5>Calamine lotion</h5><ul><li>Calamine lotion is thought to relieve itch by evaporating from the skin to induce a cooling effect [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">Allen, 2006</a>].  </li><li>CKS found no evidence on the use of calamine lotion to treat itch in chickenpox, however it is considered to be an option as it is recommended by the authors of some review articles and there is anecdotal evidence to support its use [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">Allen, 2006</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">Tebruegge et al, 2006</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">Gould, 2014</a>]. Some experts state that it can dry the skin and increase itch [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2016</a>].</li><li>There is no available evidence on the safety of calamine lotion during pregnancy and lactation, however it has been used for many years with no reports of adverse effects [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">ABPI, 2015a</a>].</li></ul><h5>Chlorphenamine</h5><ul><li>CKS found no evidence to support the use of chlorphenamine in pregnant women with chickenpox.</li><li>Although data do not suggest an increase in the risk of congenital malformations if chlorphenamine is used in pregnancy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">UKTIS, 2014</a>], the manufacturer of chlorphenamine advises using the drug during pregnancy only if essential [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">ABPI, 2016b</a>] and it is generally advised that drugs should be avoided if possible during the first trimester [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">BNF 72, 2016</a>]. Even though the risks of chlorphenamine use in pregnancy appear to be low, taking into account the lack of evidence that chlorphenamine offers symptomatic benefit in people with chickenpox, CKS does not recommend its use in pregnant women.</li></ul><h5>Topical crotamiton and colloidal oatmeal bath additives</h5><ul><li>CKS found no evidence to justify the use of topical crotamiton and colloidal oatmeal bath additives in chickenpox.</li></ul><!-- end field 83f801f4-2484-4217-821f-10aec8b902c0 --><!-- end item 42fc9f2c-28fe-4a86-b659-97c40d36e369 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
