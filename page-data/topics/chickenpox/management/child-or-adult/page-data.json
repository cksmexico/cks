Although the confounding factor of the increased likelihood of NSAIDs being required for children with severe cases of chickenpox or complications was noted, on the basis of the available evidence the authors recommended avoiding NSAIDs in children with chickenpox. Paracetamol was recommended as the preferred alternative treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">UKMi, 2016</a>]. </li><li>The risk of skin reactions in adults with chickenpox using NSAIDs is unclear as most of the available trials involved children [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">UKMi, 2016</a>]. Until further evidence is available, CKS recommends avoiding NSAIDs such as ibuprofen in adults with chickenpox, in line with expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">Gould, 2014</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Calamine lotion</h5><ul><li>Calamine lotion is thought to relieve itch by evaporating from the skin to induce a cooling effect [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">Allen, 2006</a>].</li><li>CKS found no evidence on the use of calamine lotion to treat itch in chickenpox, however it is considered to be an option as it is recommended by the authors of some review articles and there is anecdotal evidence to support its use [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">Allen, 2006</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">Tebruegge et al, 2006</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">Gould, 2014</a>]. Some experts state that it can dry the skin and increase itch [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2016</a>].  </li></ul><h5>Antihistamines</h5><ul><li>There is very limited evidence to support the use of topical or systemic antihistamines in relieving pruritus in those with chickenpox. CKS has based this recommendation on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">Gould, 2014</a>] and the fact that Piriton<sup>® </sup>(but not generic chlorphenamine), is licensed for the symptomatic relief of itching due to chickenpox [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">ABPI, 2016a</a>].<ul><li>Chlorphenamine should not be given to those less than 1 year of age as it is not licensed for use in this age group [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">ABPI, 2016a</a>].</li></ul></li><li>In a literature review, only one poor-quality randomized trial was found that investigated the effect of antihistamines in chickenpox [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/chickenpox/references/\">Tebruegge et al, 2006</a>]. CKS found no other randomized trials on the effect of antihistamines (including chlorphenamine) in people with chickenpox.</li></ul><h5>Crotamiton and colloidal oatmeal bath additives</h5><ul><li>CKS found no evidence to justify the use of topical crotamiton and colloidal oatmeal bath additives in chickenpox.</li></ul><!-- end field 3cb57f4e-a1e1-4868-ae10-5f24d7209da9 --><!-- end item f135f0da-edfd-4b05-bc9a-34fbbaa49f28 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
