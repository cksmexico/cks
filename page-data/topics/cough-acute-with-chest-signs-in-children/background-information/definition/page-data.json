Wheeze is associated with respiratory tract infection and in the majority of children the tendency to wheeze remits by 6 years of age. The mechanism by which infection causes wheeze is complex and not fully understood, but it is known that these children have abnormally small airways [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cough-acute-with-chest-signs-in-children/references/\">Wilson, 2003</a>].</li><li><strong>Infective exacerbations of asthma </strong>may be difficult to distinguish from viral-induced wheeze in a child of less than 5 years of age. In an infective exacerbation of asthma, wheezing occurs due to bronchoconstriction in response to a respiratory tract infection (most commonly viral), but may also have been observed in response to typical asthma triggers, such as exercise and exposure to allergens. Asthma is more common in children with atopy or a family history of atopy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cough-acute-with-chest-signs-in-children/references/\">Wilson, 2003</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cough-acute-with-chest-signs-in-children/references/\">BTS/SIGN, 2016</a>].</li><li><strong>Bronchiolitis </strong>is a condition which predominately affects infants of less than 12 months of age. It is caused by a viral infection, most commonly respiratory syncytial virus, of the epithelial lining of the lower bronchial tree [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cough-acute-with-chest-signs-in-children/references/\">SIGN, 2006</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cough-acute-with-chest-signs-in-children/references/\">NICE, 2015b</a>]. Infected epithelial cells slough off into the small airways and the alveolar spaces. This, together with mucus, causes variable obstruction of the small airways, with complete obstruction and collapse in some, and partial obstruction in others. These changes result in impaired gas exchange leading to hypoxia and breathlessness [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cough-acute-with-chest-signs-in-children/references/\">DeVincenzo, 2007</a>].</li><li><strong>Community-acquired pneumonia </strong>is an acute infection of the lung parenchyma, that may be caused by bacterial or viral infection. Infection leads to localized collapse and consolidation of the alveolar air spaces, resulting in impaired gas exchange, which may cause hypoxia and breathlessness [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cough-acute-with-chest-signs-in-children/references/\">Bartlett, 2010</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cough-acute-with-chest-signs-in-children/references/\">Harris et al, 2011</a>].</li><li>The British Thoracic Society reviewed prospective studies of the pathological causes of community-acquired pneumonia in children.
