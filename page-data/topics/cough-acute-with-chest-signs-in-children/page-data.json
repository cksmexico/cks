No combination of symptoms or signs has been shown to give absolute clinical certainty in diagnosing these conditions.</li><li>Viral-induced wheeze occurs in children aged between 6 months and 5 years who present with wheeze in association with respiratory tract infection.</li><li>Infective exacerbations of asthma, in which wheezing occurs due to bronchoconstriction in response to a respiratory tract infection, may be difficult to distinguish from viral-induced wheeze.</li><li>Bronchiolitis occurs predominantly in infants aged less than 12 months. It is caused by a viral infection, most commonly respiratory syncytial virus. Respiratory rate is usually increased, wheeze may be present, hyperinflation is often present and there are fine crackles throughout the lung fields.</li><li>Community-acquired pneumonia may be caused by bacteria or viruses. Consider in a feverish child, who has a respiratory rate of 60 breaths per minute or more,  and/or signs of increased work of breathing, and/or crackles in the chest, and/or cyanosis.</li><li>Assessment of a child with respiratory symptoms should include:<ul><li>Noting the degree of agitation and consciousness. Agitation and behavioural changes in a child may be a sign of hypoxia. </li><li>Looking for signs of exhaustion, cyanosis (bluish lips or extremities), and use of accessory muscles while the child is at rest.</li><li>Examining the child's chest, and recording their respiratory rate, pulse, and blood pressure. </li><li>Measuring the child's oxygen saturation in room air using pulse oximetry (if available). </li><li>Measuring peak expiratory flow rate (if possible) in children with viral-induced wheeze/an infective asthma exacerbation.</li><li>Assessing the child's hydration status.</li></ul></li><li>Factors that indicate the need for urgent hospital admission include:<ul><li>Raised respiratory rate (RR) higher than 60–70 breaths per minute, apnoea or grunting, moderate or severe chest indrawing.</li><li>Cyanosis.</li><li>No response to social cues, unable to be roused, or if rousable they do not stay awake.</li><li>Appears ill to healthcare professional.</li><li>Clinical dehydration.</li><li>Age less than 3 months and temperature at least 38°C, or age over 3 months and temperature higher than 39°C.</li><li>Peak expiratory flow rate less than 50% best or predicted in children with viral-induced wheeze/an infective asthma exacerbation.</li></ul></li><li>Hospital admission should also be considered for children with factors including: <ul><li>Age 6–12 months and RR 50–60 breaths per minute, or age over 12 months and RR 40–60 breaths per minute, nasal flaring, crackles.</li><li>Oxygen saturation equal to or less than 95% in air.</li><li>Pallor reported by parent/carer.</li><li>No response to normal social cues, awakes only with prolonged stimulation, decreased activity.</li><li>Poor feeding in infants (less than 50% of normal fluid intake in preceding 24 hours), dry mucous membranes, reduced urine output.</li><li>Capillary refill time equal to or greater than 3 seconds.</li></ul></li><li>Children who are assessed as being at low risk may be treated at home and the parent/carer should be advised to seek medical advice if there is any deterioration.</li></ul><!-- end field 5b61dfb5-8e87-4465-bdd7-e4b4f7801a2a --><!-- end item 0a5a721c-6608-4c6b-b2d7-45dbdb08c4b3 -->","topic":{"id":"ecc57759-d8a2-50b5-addc-68127dd57e13","topicId":"6f239a86-8a9f-4fc1-85b2-df045fbf9477","topicName":"Cough -
