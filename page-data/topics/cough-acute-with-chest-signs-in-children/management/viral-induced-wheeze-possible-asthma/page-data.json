Agitation and behavioural changes in a child may be a sign of hypoxia. </li><li>Look for signs of exhaustion (inability to complete sentences, if applicable), cyanosis (bluish lips or extremities), and use of accessory muscles while the child is at rest.</li><li>Examine the child's chest, and record their respiratory rate, pulse, and blood pressure. </li><li>Record the child's peak expiratory flow rate (if they are old and well enough to comply) and use the best of three recordings compared to their best  (if measured within the last two years) or predicted PEFR value. </li><li>Measure the child's oxygen saturation in room air using pulse oximetry (if available). </li><li><strong>The severity of an attack is graded as follows:</strong><ul><li>Moderate – PEFR at least 50% best or predicted and normal speech (if applicable), with no acute severe or life-threatening features.</li><li>Acute severe – PEFR less than 50% best or predicted, <em>or</em> respiratory rate of at least 25/min in children over the age of 12 years, 30/min in children between the ages of 5 and 12 years, and 40/min in children between 2 and 5 years old, <em>or </em>pulse rate of at least 110/min in children over the age of 12 years, 125/min in children between the ages of 5 and 12 years, and 140/min in children between 2 and 5 years old, <em>or</em> inability to complete sentences in one breath (if applicable), or accessory muscle use, <em>or</em> inability to feed, with oxygen saturation of at least 92%.</li><li>Life-threatening – PEFR  less than 33% best or predicted, <em>or</em> oxygen saturation of less than 92%, <em>or</em> altered consciousness, <em>or</em> exhaustion, <em>or</em> cardiac arrhythmia, <em>or</em> hypotension, <em>o</em>r cyanosis, <em>or</em> poor respiratory effort, <em>or</em> silent chest, <em>or</em> confusion.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Consider the need for hospital admission. The threshold for admission should be low in children:</strong><ul><li>Admit all children with life-threatening features.</li><li>Admit children with any feature of a severe attack persisting after initial bronchodilator treatment.</li><li>Admit children with a moderate attack with worsening symptoms despite initial bronchodilator treatment and/or who have had a previous near-fatal asthma attack.</li><li>Other factors that lower the threshold for hospital admission include the infant/child having been born prematurely, any significant medical history, such as congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease of prematurity, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and immune deficiency, and the ability of the child's carers to cope with the ill child (in particular, assess the carer's experience, their level of anxiety, and the time they have available to care for the child).</li></ul></li><li><strong>While awaiting admission to hospital:</strong><ul><li>Give controlled supplementary oxygen to all children with hypoxia using a face mask, Venturi mask, or nasal cannulae. Adjust flow rates as necessary to maintain an oxygen saturation of 94–98% but do not delay oxygen administration in the absence of pulse oximetry.</li><li>Treat with a short-acting beta-<sub>2</sub> agonist:<ul><li>For life-threatening or severe attacks, give nebulized salbutamol (5 mg to all children aged over 5 years, and 2.5 mg to children aged  2–5 years).  Ideally, nebulizers should be oxygen driven (flow rate of 6 L /min usually needed) to avoid worsening hypoxia. If an oxygen-driven nebulizer is unavailable, deliver by air-driven nebulizer, although be alert that oxygen desaturation may occur. Continuous nebulization is preferred in severe obstruction, but not all nebulizer systems can do this. When using intermittent nebulization, repeat salbutamol administration every 20–30 minutes. When using a continuous nebulizer, give the dose over 30–60 minutes.</li><li>If a nebulizer is not available, or if the attack is of moderate severity, use a pressurized metered-dose inhaler with a large-volume spacer. Children under the age of three years are likely to require a face mask connected to the mouthpiece of a spacer for successful drug delivery. A short pause between puffs may be necessary to avoid hyperventilation with puffs given one at a time and inhaled with five tidal breaths. Give a puff every 30–60 seconds, up to 10 puffs. If the response is poor, give further doses while awaiting hospital admission, and switch to a nebulizer if available.</li></ul></li><li>Monitor peak expiratory flow rate (if the child can comply) and oxygen saturation (if available) to assess response to treatment.</li></ul></li><li><strong>If the child does not require hospital admission:</strong><ul><li>Use a short-acting beta-<sub>2</sub> agonist via a large-volume spacer to relieve acute symptoms. Give a puff every 30–60 seconds, up to 10 puffs. Each puff should be given one at a time and inhaled with five tidal breaths. Repeat every 10–20 minutes according to clinical response.</li><li>If the child responds favourably to bronchodilator treatment, prescribe a short-acting beta-<sub>2</sub> agonist and spacer device to use at home as required.</li><li>If the child has an existing asthma diagnosis, or if asthma is suspected (for example if wheezing has also been observed in response to triggers other than viral infection, and/or there is a personal or family history of atopy), prescribe a short course of oral prednisolone. For information on doses, see the section on <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cough-acute-with-chest-signs-in-children/prescribing-information/\">Prescribing information</a>.<ul></ul></li><li>Prescribe antibiotics if symptoms and signs suggest a bacterial infection. Amoxicillin is first-line treatment, with doxycycline an alternative for those aged 12 years and over if amoxicillin is contraindicated or not tolerated. Other alternatives include cefaclor, or a macrolide such as erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin. Duration of treatment is usually five days. For information on dosing, please see the section on <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cough-acute-with-chest-signs-in-children/prescribing-information/\">Prescribing information</a>.</li><li>Provide self-care advice.<ul><li>Advise the parents/carers to use either paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat a child who is distressed due to fever. Antipyretic agents should not be used with the sole aim of reducing body temperature, and should be continued for only as long as the child appears distressed.</li><li>Advise the parents/carers to consider changing to the other agent if the child's distress is not alleviated, but not to give both agents simultaneously, and to only alternate these agents if the distress persists, or recurs before the next dose is due.</li><li>Advise them not attempt to reduce fever by under-dressing the child or with use of tepid sponging.</li><li>Advise them to encourage the child to take fluids regularly. For infants that are breastfed, advise continued breastfeeding.</li></ul></li><li>For children managed at home, advise parents/carers to check on the child regularly, including through the night and to seek medical advice if they are unable to cope, or if the child deteriorates, particularly if:<ul><li>Breathing rate increases or there are any episodes of apnoea or signs of increased effort of breathing.</li><li>A baby takes less than 50% of its normal feeds, or there are signs of dehydration such as dry mouth or infrequent passage of urine.</li><li>A baby becomes less responsive or difficult to rouse.</li><li>There is persistent worsening of fever.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Follow-up the child within 48 hours of presentation, if not admitted to hospital. Follow-up all children admitted to hospital within 2 working days of discharge.</strong><ul><li>Review symptoms and check peak expiratory flow if the child is old enough to comply.</li><li>Advise the child and/or the parents/carers on recognizing symptoms of a respiratory tract infection that could trigger a further attack, as well as early signs of an attack (such as worsening symptoms or peak flow readings), and to seek medical help if symptoms are not controlled.</li><li>If the child or their parent/carer smokes, advise them to stop.</li><li>For children with mild intermittent wheeze and other respiratory symptoms that occur only with viral upper respiratory infections, consider managing without use of maintenance treatment, but plan a review after an agreed interval.</li><li>For children with more severe wheeze who have exhibited a symptomatic response to bronchodilators, prescribe a bronchodilator and spacer device to use at home as required.<ul><li>In children under 2 years of age who do not respond to bronchodilators, consider repeating a trial of therapy if any further attacks occur, as some children may become more responsive as they get older.</li></ul></li><li>For information on management of children with suspected or confirmed asthma, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/asthma/\">Asthma</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 2a35b60a-cb7e-4ff5-bff7-2a0eba02cfa3 --><!-- end item 5af69852-0d59-4b6a-8521-c9b603a95e3f -->","subChapters":[{"id":"ccc7cb80-87cf-5688-94f6-1e1ca2db378c","slug":"basis-for-recommendation-fa7","fullItemName":"Basis for recommendation","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field f0aef56a-d8cf-4ea3-9b3e-73e9894f408f --><h4>Basis for recommendation</h4><!-- end field f0aef56a-d8cf-4ea3-9b3e-73e9894f408f -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item fa73b91c-138b-4df5-9c26-8598a590eaf3 --><!-- begin field c06c2e1b-4ca4-4a14-a2ef-1931fcc5505f --><p>The information on how to manage a child with viral-induced wheeze or an infective exacerbation of asthma is largely based on expert opinion relating to the management of an acute exacerbation of asthma in the British Thoracic Society (BTS) and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) <em>British guideline on the management of asthma</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/cough-acute-with-chest-signs-in-children/references/\">BTS/SIGN, 2016</a>]<em>. </em></p><ul><li>Although the authors of this guideline state that it<em> '</em>is intended for children who are thought to have acute wheeze related to underlying asthma', the assessment and initial management of acute viral wheeze and wheeze caused by underlying asthma is expected to be identical.
