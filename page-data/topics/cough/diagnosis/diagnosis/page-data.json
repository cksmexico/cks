Upper airway abnormalities are a key component and seasonal and occupational triggers are risk factors in some people. On examination, there may be visible mucus and a cobblestone appearance to the posterior oropharyngeal wall and local upper airway structures.</li></ul></li><li><strong><strong>A</strong></strong><strong><strong>ssess whether the person has clinical features of the following common causes: </strong></strong><ul style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><li><strong>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced cough</strong> — suggested by bouts of coughing associated with the perception of airway irritation occurring within hours to months of the first dose. </li><li><strong>Asthma </strong>— suggested by wheeze, breathlessness, worsening symptoms at night, in the morning, or with exercise and exposure to allergens. Peak expiratory flow rate is reduced during an episode. The prevalence of asthma in people with chronic cough ranges from 24–29%. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/asthma/\">Asthma</a>. </li><li><strong>Eosinophilic bronchitis</strong> — suggested by normal chest examination, normal spirometry, and normal response to airway provocation test (only available to a specialist). </li><li><strong>Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease</strong> — suggested by cough that is worse during or after eating, with talking, and with bending.

For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/chest-infections-adult/\">Chest infections - adult</a>. </li><li><strong>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</strong>  — suggested by persistent progressive breathlessness usually associated with wheezing or chest tightness, hyperinflated chest, possibly with signs of right-sided heart failure such as ankle oedema and increased jugular venous pressure. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/\">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a>. </li><li><strong>Cough-variant asthma </strong>— suggested by normal chest examination, normal spirometry, and hyper-responsiveness to airway provocation test (only available to a specialist).</li><li><strong>Environmental or occupational causes </strong>— cough can be an isolated symptom as a result of exposure to triggers (for example, perfume, dust, chemicals, pollutants) or manifestation of a more significant disease. Cough may be worse on weekdays and better at weekends for occupational causes.</li><li><strong>Foreign body aspiration</strong> — suggested by sudden-onset cough, stridor (upper airway) or reduced chest wall movement on the affected side, bronchial breathing, and reduced or diminished breath sounds (lower airway). </li><li><strong>Heart failure</strong> — suggested by significant breathlessness, orthopnoea, and/or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. There may be peripheral oedema and raised jugular venous pressure. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/\">Heart failure - chronic</a>.</li><li><strong>Interstitial lung disease (ILD)</strong> — suggested by breathlessness and cough (often dry). Although breathlessness is typical, people often present with non-specific signs and symptoms. There may be fine-end inspiratory crackles (indicative of fibrosis), finger clubbing, cyanosis, and signs of right-sided heart failure. <ul><li>When the ILD is caused by sensitization to allergens, there may be a history of recurrent episodes of flu-like illness following exposure. </li><li>When the ILD is associated with connective tissue disease, there may be symptoms such as joint pain. </li><li>Diagnosis is confirmed by spirometry with a restrictive pattern, chest X-ray or high resolution computed tomography (HRCT).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Lung cancer</strong> — suggested by haemoptysis, persistent chest and/or shoulder pain, breathlessness, weight loss, hoarseness, finger clubbing, and cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.

There may be vomiting after coughing, or an inspiratory whoop. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/whooping-cough/\">Whooping cough</a>. </li><li><strong>Pulmonary tuberculosis</strong> — suggested by sputum, breathlessness, haemoptysis, weight loss, fever, night sweats, anorexia, general malaise, and finger clubbing. This should be considered in all patients complaining of cough in endemic areas, regardless of cough duration. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/\">Tuberculosis</a>. </li><li><strong>Sitagliptin-induced cough</strong> — suggested by cough accompanied with rhinorrhoea, dyspnoea, or fatigue.</li><li><strong>Somatic cough syndrome</strong> — the diagnosis of somatic cough disorder can only be made after an extensive evaluation has been performed that includes ruling out tic disorders and uncommon causes and the person meets the DSM-5 criteria for a somatic symptom disorder.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field
