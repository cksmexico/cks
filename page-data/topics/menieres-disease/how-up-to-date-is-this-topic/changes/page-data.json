A literature search was conducted in August 2012 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key RCTs published since the last revision of this topic. No major changes to recommendations have been made, but the diagnosis and assessment scenarios have been restructured, and links are provided to the CKS topics on <em>Tinnitus</em> and <em>Vertigo</em> which contain more detailed information on determining the diagnosis in a person presenting with these symptoms. Minor amendments have been made to the section regarding advice on driving.</p><p><strong>March 2011 </strong>— topic structure revised to ensure consistency across CKS topics — no changes to clinical recommendations have been made.</p><p><strong>January 2010 </strong>— minor update. Additional text regarding use of promethazine teoclate in pregnancy added. Issued in January 2010.</p><p><strong>January 2008 </strong>— minor update. References corrected in the <em>Prevalence</em> section. Issued in January 2008.</p><p><strong>June to October 2007 </strong>— converted from CKS guidance to CKS topic structure. The evidence-base has been reviewed in detail, and recommendations are more clearly justified and transparently linked to the supporting evidence. The key message about diagnosing Meniere's disease is more explicit in that the diagnosis can only be confirmed by referral to Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) services. While awaiting referral, attacks of Meniere's disease–like symptoms may have to be managed in primary care.</p><p><strong>October 2005 </strong>— minor technical update.
