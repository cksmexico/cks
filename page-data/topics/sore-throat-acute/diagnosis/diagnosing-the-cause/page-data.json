The precise diagnosis may be clinically significant in more severe cases or of epidemiological interest. </p><p><strong>To identify the underlying <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sore-throat-acute/background-information/causes/\">cause</a> of a sore throat:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Examine the person's throat and neck:</strong><ul><li>Pharyngitis is often is associated with pharyngeal exudate and cervical lymphadenopathy</li><li>Tonsillitis is associated with tonsillar exudate and enlargement and erythema of the tonsils. There may be anterior cervical lymphadenopathy.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Ask the person about their symptoms. </strong>Non-specific symptoms may include:<ul><li>Headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain — may be present in children with pharyngitis, and all people with tonsillitis.</li><li>Fever — this is common in pharyngitis and tonsillitis. Most people with acute tonsillitis have a fever >38°C.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Be aware that a sore throat may occasionally result in </strong><strong>significantly</strong><strong> reduced fluid intake, which may lead to dehydration.</strong><ul><li>Ask the person about recent fluid intake if pain on swallowing is significant. For babies and young children, ask the parent/carer about number of wet nappies, whether fluid intake is significantly reduced (50 to 75% normal volume) and examine the child for signs of clinical dehydration (reduced skin turgor and/or a capillary refill time of more than three seconds, and/or dry mucous membranes).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Consider the person's signs and symptoms, and use the FeverPAIN or </strong><strong>Centor</strong><strong> clinical prediction score to determine the likelihood of streptococcal infection (and therefore the need for antibiotic treatment):</strong><ul><li>Acute Group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis/tonsillitis is common in children and adolescents aged 5 to 15 years and is more common in the winter (or early spring) in temperate climates. Streptococcal infection is suggested by fever > 38.5°C, exudate on the pharynx/tonsils, anterior neck lymphadenopathy, and absence of cough. A scarlatiniform rash may be present, especially in children.  </li><li>The <strong>FeverPAIN</strong> criteria are: score 1 point for each (maximum score of 5)<ul><li><strong>Fever</strong> over 38°C. </li><li><strong>P</strong>urulence (pharyngeal/tonsillar exudate).</li><li><strong>A</strong>ttend rapidly (3 days or less)</li><li>Severely <strong>I</strong>nflamed tonsils</li><li><strong>N</strong>o cough or coryza</li><li>A score of 0 or 1 is associated with a 13% to 18% likelihood of isolating streptococcus. A score of 2 or 3 is associated with a 34% to 40% likelihood of isolating streptococcus. A score of 4 or 5 is associated with a 62% to 65% likelihood of isolating streptococcus.</li></ul></li><li>Centor criteria<ul><li>Tonsillar exudate</li><li>Tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy or lymphadenitis</li><li>History of fever (over 38°C)</li><li>Absence of cough</li><li>Each of the Centor criteria score 1 point (maximum score of 4). A score of 0, 1 or 2 is thought to be associated with a 3 to 17% likelihood of isolating streptococcus. A score of 3 or 4 is thought to be associated with a 32 to 56% likelihood of isolating streptococcus.</li></ul></li><li>If the diagnosis of GAS needs to be confirmed with certainty (such as in people at high risk of rheumatic fever, vulnerable people such as the very old or young, or people who are at risk of immunosuppression, or people with very severe symptoms), arrange a rapid antigen test for group A streptococcus. A negative antigen test in a person (particularly a child) with suspected GAS should be followed up with a throat culture.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Other common (non-streptococcal) infectious causes of </strong><strong>acute</strong><strong> sore </strong><strong>throat,</strong><strong> and their signs and symptoms include:</strong><ul><li>The common cold — suggested by rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, and cough.  For more information, see the CKS topic on the <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/\">Common cold</a>.</li><li>Influenza — suggested by headache, weakness and fatigue, myalgia, malaise, anorexia, insomnia, a dry, unproductive cough, and fever. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/influenza-seasonal/\">Influenza - seasonal</a>.</li><li>Pharyngoconjunctival fever — suggested by fever and conjunctivitis. Malaise, myalgia, headache, rhinitis and cervical adenitis may also be present.</li><li>Acute herpetic pharyngitis — suggested by vesicles and shallow ulcers on the palate (although these are not always present). There may be cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, and exudate. If there is an associated gingivostomatitis, vesicles and ulcers are also present on the labial and buccal mucosa. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/herpes-simplex-oral/\">Herpes simplex - oral</a>.</li><li>Infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever) — suggested by pharyngitis of longer than several days' duration, adenopathy, and splenomegaly.  A serum monospot test should be carried out to confirm the diagnosis (in people over 4 years of age) and full blood count should also be considered — a raised WBC count with lymphocytosis and atypical lymphocytes is suggestive of infectious mononucleosis. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/glandular-fever-infectious-mononucleosis/\">Glandular fever (infectious mononucleosis)</a>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Rarer infectious causes of </strong><strong>sore</strong><strong> throat include:</strong><ul><li>Herpangina — suggested by acute onset of fever, sore throat, and dysphagia, and also vomiting and abdominal symptoms. Small vesicles (1–2 mm) may be seen on the soft palate, fauces, palate, uvula, and tonsils, which rupture to become small white ulcers. The condition usually affects people of 2–20 years of age and most commonly occurs in the late summer and autumn.</li><li>Hand, foot, and mouth disease — suggested by fever (typically 38–39°C), malaise, loss of appetite, cough, abdominal pain, and sore mouth that precede the development of tender lesions in the mouth and/or vesicles on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Children younger than 4 years of age are most commonly affected and it most commonly occurs in the late summer and autumn. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/hand-foot-mouth-disease/\">Hand foot and mouth disease</a>.</li><li>HIV-1— sore throat may be a feature of primary HIV infection and occurs after an incubation period of 3–5 weeks, with myalgia, arthralgia, lethargy, and in some people a non-itchy maculopapular rash. Lymphadenopathy develops a week later. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/hiv-infection-aids/\">HIV infections and AIDS</a>.</li><li>Gonorrhoea — causes mild pharyngitis. Should be considered in sexually active or abused individuals with pharyngitis, especially in those with negative cultures for GAS. Take throat swabs for culture to confirm the diagnosis. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/gonorrhoea/\">Gonorrhoea</a>.</li><li>Diphtheria — consider if oropharyngeal membranes appear grey/green, and/or the person has not been vaccinated. Take throat swabs for culture to confirm the diagnosis. </li><li>Measles —  suggested by conjunctivitis, rhinitis, cough, and characteristic maculopapular rash in a person who is non-vaccinated. Koplik spots (bluish-white, raised lesions on an erythematous base on the buccal mucosa) are characteristic. </li><li>Arcanobacterial pharyngitis —  suggested by a diffuse, sometimes itchy, erythematous maculopapular rash on the extremities and trunk. Pharyngeal exudate and cervical lymphadenopathy are commonly present.</li><li>Yersinial pharyngitis — this is associated with contaminated food and drink, but in adults may occur without gastrointestinal symptoms. Rarely, there may be a fulminant course with a high mortality rate. Fever, prominent cervical lymphadenopathy, and abdominal pain with or without diarrhoea have been reported.</li><li>Tularaemia — may be suggested by pharyngeal ulceration and exudate, and a history of ingestion of undercooked wild animal meat. The pharyngitis may have previously failed to respond to penicillin. Take throat swabs for culture to confirm the diagnosis. </li><li>Chlamydial pharyngitis, mycoplasmal pharyngitis— may occur in association with pneumonia or bronchitis but otherwise have no clear distinguishing features. Chlamydial pharyngitis should be considered in sexually active or abused individuals with pharyngitis, especially in those with negative cultures for GAS. Take throat swabs for culture to confirm the diagnosis. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/chlamydia-uncomplicated-genital/\">Chlamydia - uncomplicated genital</a>.</li><li>Candida albicans — may cause pharyngitis in immunosuppressed individuals, people who use inhaled corticosteroids, or those undergoing chemotherapy or irradiation for oropharyngeal cancer.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Non-infectious causes include:</strong><ul><li>Physical irritation — consider in people with a nasogastric tube, or who smoke.</li><li>Hayfever. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/allergic-rhinitis/\">Allergic rhinitis</a>.</li><li>Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-gord/\">Dyspepsia - proven GORD</a>.</li><li>Kawasaki disease — may occasionally present as sore throat without exudate. The cause of Kawasaki disease is unknown. The majority of cases occur in children under 4 years of age. Kawasaki disease is diagnosed by the presence of either five of the six main symptoms, or four main symptoms if coronary aneurysms are identified by echocardiography. The six main symptoms are:<ul><li>Fever of unknown aetiology lasting 5 days or more.</li><li>Bilateral conjunctivitis.</li><li>Changes in the lips and oral cavity (dryness and fissuring of the lips, and redness of the oral cavity and pharynx).</li><li>Cervical lymphadenopathy.</li><li>Polymorphous rash (a combination of morbilliform, scarlatiniform, urticariform, or erythema multiforme-like rash).</li><li>Changes in the extremities (reddening of the palms and soles, desquamation of the skin, and oedema of the hands and feet).</li></ul></li><li>Oral mucositis secondary to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, which may become secondarily infected. For more information see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-oral/\">Palliative care - oral</a>.</li><li>Haematological disorders: <ul><li>Leukaemia: ulceration and haemorrhage of the mucous membrane of the pharynx may occur. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/haematological-cancers-recognition-referral/\">Haematological cancers - recognition and referral</a>.</li><li>Aplastic anaemia: sloughing and ulceration of the mouth and pharynx may occur.</li></ul></li><li>Drugs that can cause blood disorders (e.g. neutropenia, agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia) leading to infection and acute sore throat. These include cytotoxic drugs, carbimazole, clozapine, and sulfasalazine.</li><li>Oropharyngeal cancer — suggested by hoarseness, dysphonia, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and neck mass or adenopathy.</li><li>Behcet's syndrome — suggested by vesicles on pharynx, genital ulcers, skin and eye lesions.</li><li>Steven's Johnson syndrome — suggested by vesicles on pharynx, along with more pronounced mucosal changes in a person with recent infections, seizures, or new medications.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Be alert for serious underlying causes/complications that can be associated with </strong><strong>sore</strong><strong> throat, including:</strong><ul><li>Epiglottitis — suggested by severe and acute onset of sore throat and fever, muffled voice, drooling, and stridor.<ul><li>A child with epiglottitis prefers to sit leaning forward. Breathing tends to be tentative and careful, without marked increase in respiration rate. Inspiratory stridor and hoarseness may occur. Tachycardia may be out of proportion to the fever if hypoxia is present.</li><li>In adults, predictors of airway compromise include sitting erect, stridor, and dyspnoea.</li><li><strong>Note: Do not examine the throat of anyone with suspected epiglottitis as this may precipitate closure of the airway.</strong></li></ul></li><li>Peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) — suggested by fever, neck pain, trismus, a muffled voice, a displaced uvula, and an enlarged, displaced tonsil, with swelling of the peri-tonsillar region. It is most common in children 2 to 4 years of age.</li><li>Retropharyngeal abscess — suggested by severe sore throat that does not resolve after a few days. There may be trismus or visible neck swelling.</li><li>Lemierre syndrome — thrombophlebitis of the jugular vein. Typically seen in people with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 487908c5-ec21-48c5-99ca-2ef0460662fb --><!-- end item 1f4e8f69-7d15-4458-8158-5442ca1da791 -->","topic":{"id":"b9203bc1-aec0-515e-b8a8-df5fbd75f255","topicId":"a235ee81-d6c7-4837-95b1-fc8ac97489f1","topicName":"Sore throat -

However, a positive test in the absence of characteristic symptoms (fever, lack of cough, exudate, and tender cervical adenopathy) probably represents colonisation and is not clinically relevant [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sore-throat-acute/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2016b</a>].</li><li>A systematic review ([<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sore-throat-acute/references/\">Aalbers et al, 2011</a>]) assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the Centor criteria for estimating the probability of GABHS pharyngitis. A Centor score of 3 or more had a specificity of 0.82 and a sensitivity of 0.49 9 (low-quality evidence). The authors concluded that Centor is a well-calibrated tool for estimating the probability of GABHS pharyngitis, and can enhance the appropriate prescribing of antibiotics. </li><li>A systematic review of RCTs (Cohen et al. 2016) found that rapid antigen testing has high sensitivity and specificity for identifying GABHS infection. In studies that compared rapid antigen testing and throat culture, rapid antigen testing had a summary sensitivity of 85.6% and a summary specificity of 95.4% (very low-quality evidence).</li><li>NICE Sore Throat CGC committee were aware that FeverPAIN was developed in a UK primary care setting in 2013, although further external validation has not been carried out. The committee noted that the Centor criteria were developed in the US in an emergency department setting in 1981 and have not been validated in a UK primary care setting [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sore-throat-acute/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>]. </li><li>The committee noted that people with a FeverPAIN score of 4 or 5 had a 62-65% probability of having a bacterial infection, which is slightly higher than people with a Centor score of 4 who have a 55.7% probability of a bacterial infection. The committee recognised that the evidence review did not identify any studies that directly compared the diagnostic accuracy of the different clinical scoring systems. </li></ul><!-- end field d37bdbbc-a4fe-43f9-b30e-4e56b15e0437 --><!-- end item 8c4dfe27-e0bc-46e0-aded-8dabd01f1c89 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
