Pertussis is rarely diagnosed during this stage unless there has been contact with a person who is known to be infected. Symptoms are often difficult to distinguish from those of other upper respiratory tract infections, and include:<ul><li>Nasal discharge.</li><li>Conjunctivitis.</li><li>Malaise.</li><li>Sore throat.</li><li>Low-grade fever.</li><li>Dry, unproductive cough.</li></ul></li><li><strong>The paroxysmal phase </strong>typically occurs about 1 week after the catarrhal phase and lasts between one and six weeks. Between coughing fits (paroxysms), the person is usually relatively well, and has undisturbed sleep. The paroxysmal episodes during this phase:<ul><li>Typically consist of a short expiratory burst followed by an inspiratory gasp, causing the 'whoop' sound. The ‘whoop’ is less common in adults, and in children younger than 3 months of age (who may present with apnoea alone).</li><li>Are more common at night, may be triggered by external stimuli (for example cold or noise), and there may be more than 30 paroxysms in 24 hours.</li><li>May yield thick mucous plugs or watery secretions. However, there are usually no other chest signs (such as wheeze or crackles).</li><li>May be severe enough to cause cyanosis in children, and are frequently associated with post-tussive vomiting. Adults may experience sweating attacks with facial flushing, and rarely, cough syncope.</li></ul></li><li><strong>The convalescent phase </strong>lasts up to 3 months, during which there is a gradual improvement in cough frequency and severity. However, paroxysms can recur with subsequent respiratory infections for many months after the initial infection.</li></ul><!-- end field acd3f715-d3e4-47af-a455-938c81e9275a --><!-- end item 91ed87e2-b353-4362-b780-ceb8151c359e -->","topic":{"id":"35659c4f-d80b-5e8b-8b62-22146482d6da","topicId":"aa36f776-3bec-44aa-ba6f-c147b57f7328","topicName":"Whooping cough","slug":"whooping-cough","lastRevised":"Last revised in January 2021","chapters":[{"id":"57f71ac2-7f00-5c54-b9dc-d2d7d9425e4f","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"43ee7c18-a7d1-5aaf-b7b1-e9f8aec21522","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"c127e190-a190-5b44-9ef6-9f30b6527b35","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"86a8dc5e-4401-57e4-a893-30e9405e7e8d","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"f0e375ca-3710-5454-996c-600b6987bc09","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"9165fc1a-9d30-5e58-9bb2-a1b68eab43c6","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"39a4fa70-e2db-566b-9c9e-0be39b8be0ac","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"7fd8bab1-ed01-583f-925f-50b956b1065b","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"4c330a84-fe34-5261-acf3-bcd6c9b9d2ef","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"dab08320-4d0b-59e9-b25a-28f9cc15908b","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"a088fcbf-b960-56c1-a102-2cb980dc3cb0","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
