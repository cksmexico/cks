adults with ASD should have a broad understanding of the:</strong><ul><li>Nature, development, and course of ASD.</li><li>Impact on personal, social, educational, and occupational functioning.</li><li>Impact of and interaction with the social and physical environment.</li><li>Impact on and interaction with other coexisting mental and physical disorders and their management.</li><li>Potential discrepancy between intellectual functioning as measured by IQ and adaptive functioning as reflected, for example, by difficulties in planning and performing activities of daily living, including education or employment.</li></ul></li><li><strong>All health and social care professionals providing care and support for adults with ASD should: </strong><ul><li>Aim to foster the person's autonomy, promote active participation in decisions about care and support self-management.</li><li>Maintain continuity of individual relationships wherever possible.</li><li>Ensure that comprehensive information about the nature of, and interventions and services for, their difficulties is available in an appropriate language or format (including various visual, verbal and aural, easy-read, and different colour and font formats).</li><li>Consider whether the person may benefit from access to a trained advocate.</li></ul></li><li><strong>All health and social care professionals providing care and support for adults with ASD and their families, partners, and carers should:</strong><ul><li>Ensure that they are easily identifiable (for example, by producing or wearing appropriate identification) and approachable.</li><li>Clearly communicate their role and function.</li><li>Address the person using the name and title they prefer.</li><li>Clearly explain any clinical language and check that the person with ASD understands what is being said.</li><li>Take into account communication needs, including those arising from a learning disability, sight or hearing problems, or language difficulties, and provide communication aids or independent interpreters (someone who does not have a personal relationship with the person with ASD) if required.</li></ul></li><li><strong>All health and social care professionals providing care and support for adults with ASD and their families, partners, and carers should ensure that they are: </strong><ul><li>Familiar with recognized local and national sources (organizations and websites) of information and/or support for people with ASD.</li><li>Able to discuss and advise on how to access and engage with these resources.</li></ul></li><li><strong>All health and social care professionals providing care and support for adults with ASD should:</strong><ul><li>Encourage adults with ASD to participate in self-help or support groups or access one-to-one support, and provide support so that they can attend meetings and engage in the activities.</li></ul></li><li><strong>All staff working with adults with ASD should, </strong>in all settings, take into account the physical environment in which adults with ASD are assessed, supported, and cared for, including any factors that may trigger challenging behaviour.<ul><li>If necessary adjustments or adaptations should be made to the:<ul><li>Amount of personal space given (at least an arm's length).</li><li>Setting using visual supports (for example, the use of labels with words or symbols to provide visual cues about expected behaviour).</li><li>Colour of walls and furnishings (patterns should be avoided; low-arousal colours, such as cream, should be used).</li><li>Lighting (fluorescent lighting should be reduced; blackout curtains, use of dark glasses, or increasing natural light are recommended).</li><li>Noise levels (external sounds should be reduced; use of earplugs or ear defenders should be advised).</li></ul></li><li>Where it is not possible to adjust or adapt the environment, NICE recommends considering varying the duration or nature of any assessment or intervention (including taking regular breaks) to limit the negative impact of the environment.</li></ul></li><li><strong>All health and social care professionals providing care and support for adults with ASD should: </strong><ul><li>Be aware of under-reporting and under-recognition of physical disorders in people with ASD.</li><li>Be vigilant for unusual likes and dislikes about food and/or lack of physical activity.</li><li>Offer advice on the beneficial effects of a healthy diet and exercise, taking into account any hyper- and/or hypo-sensory sensitivities; if necessary, referral to a GP or dietician should be supported.</li></ul></li><li><strong>All staff working with adults with ASD should</strong> be sensitive to issues of sexuality, including asexuality and the need to develop personal and sexual relationships.<ul><li>In particular, staff should be aware that problems in social interaction and communication may lead to the person with ASD misunderstanding another person's behaviour or to their possible exploitation by others.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Ensure that adults with ASD who have caring responsibilities receive support to access the full range of mental and physical health and social care services, including:</strong><ul><li>Specific information, advice, and support to parents about their parenting role, including parent training if needed, by professionals experienced in the care of adults and children with ASD.</li><li>Social support, such as childcare, to enable them to attend appointments, groups, and therapy sessions, and to access education and employment.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\"
