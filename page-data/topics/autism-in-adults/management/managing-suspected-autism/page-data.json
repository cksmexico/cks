However, the GDG thought it was important to provide advice in this area, given that a significant proportion of adults with ASD (about 60%) have a learning disability. <ul><li>The GDG thought that a self-completion tool would not be feasible for a significant number of people with a learning disability and that a clinician-completed measure would be unlikely to be used routinely.</li><li>Therefore, the GDG drew on a review of existing diagnostic manuals and assessment schedules designed specifically for use in people with ASD and a learning disability, which enabled the GDG to identify a number of important indicators of ASD, including social interaction problems, lack of responsiveness to others, little or no response to social situations, lack of demonstrable empathy, rigidity of routine, and marked indication of stereotypies.</li><li>The GDG formulated these into a list of considerations that should comprise a brief assessment for ASD to be performed by health and social care professionals to support them in determining whether or not to refer for a specialist assessment.</li></ul></li><li>The NICE GDG also favoured sensitivity over specificity in developing this recommendation.</li></ul><h5>Referral to a psychiatrist if an autism team is not available</h5><ul><li>The availability of autism teams varies locally. CKS has therefore based this recommendation on pragmatic considerations to allow referral, if needed, to other appropriate professionals.</li></ul><h5>Providing verbal and written information on ASD</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to provide verbal and written information on ASD is based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><!-- end field b5d067c6-1fa1-4bc6-91d3-aa5a0107ff90 --><!-- end item b658a903-cdf6-46e4-84dc-aa5a0107ff90 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
