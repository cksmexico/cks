If considered appropriate, carry out an examination and any relevant investigations, such as:</strong><ul><li>Assessment of vital signs (for example, pulse rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature) — repeat if clinically indicated.</li><li>Lying and standing blood pressure.</li><li>Assessment of other cardiovascular and neurological signs such as cardiac auscultation to detect heart murmurs and assessment for the presence of sensory, motor, speech, and vision deficits.</li><li>A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).</li><li>Measurement of blood glucose levels, if hypoglycaemia is suspected.</li><li>Full blood count to check haemoglobin levels, if anaemia or bleeding is suspected.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Assess for the presence of a life-threatening cause for blackout, such as:</strong><ul><li>Myocardial infarction and ischaemia — suggested by a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and preceding chest pain. ECG may show signs of infarction such as ST-segment elevation, new left bundle branch block, and/or arrhythmia. Note that a normal ECG does not exclude CAD. If there is any suggestion clinically that this is CAD, then the patient should be admitted for specialist review.</li><li>Cardiac arrhythmia — suggested by history of CAD, use of medicines that promote atrioventricular block or Torsades de Pointes, and/or history of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, long QT syndrome, or Brugada syndrome. Abnormalities including ventricular arrhythmia (including ventricular ectopic beats) or sustained atrial arrhythmia may be seen on ECG.</li><li>Pulmonary embolism — suggested by dizziness, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, thromboembolic (TE) risk factors, such as previous TE disease, prolonged immobilisation (e.g. flight > 4 hours), smoking, contraceptive pill or HRT use, known malignancy, or family history of thromboembolism. Be aware that syncope is a relatively common finding in older people with a PE (24% of people aged over 65 years). For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/pulmonary-embolism/\">Pulmonary embolism</a>.</li><li>Occult haemorrhage — suggested by recent tissue trauma or signs/symptoms of GI bleeding (haematemesis, and melaena), ruptured aortic aneurysm (suggested by abdominal and back pain), ruptured ovarian cyst, ruptured ectopic pregnancy (suggested by amenorrhoea, known pregnancy, previous ectopic pregnancy, prior tubal surgery, pelvic inflammatory disease, IUD usage, abdominal pain, and vaginal bleeding), retroperitoneal haemorrhage, or ruptured spleen (usually traumatic but can be spontaneous for example in a person suffering glandular fever). For more information, see the CKS topics on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/dyspepsia-proven-peptic-ulcer/\">Dyspepsia - proven peptic ulcer</a> and <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/ectopic-pregnancy/\">Ectopic pregnancy</a>.</li><li>Aortic dissection — Suggested by chest and back pain. ECG may be abnormal if the dissection involves the coronary vessels.</li><li>Cardiac tamponade —suggested by low arterial blood pressure, distended neck veins, and distant, muffled heart sounds (Beck's triad). Symptoms include dyspnoea, tachpnoea, tachycardia, anxiety, restlessness, weakness, chest pain radiating to the neck, shoulders, or back, and discomfort that is relieved by sitting or leaning forward.</li><li>Severe hypoglycaemia — suggested by confusion, anxiety, somnolence, palpitations, and lethargy, for example due to excessive administration of insulin. </li><li>Addisonian crisis — suspect in people with Addison's disease.  Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, fever, hypotension, hyperpigmentation, and electrolyte abnormalities.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Ask the person (if possible) and any witnesses about, and record details of:</strong><ul><li>The circumstances of the event.</li><li>The person's posture immediately before loss of consciousness.</li><li>Prodromal symptoms (such as sweating or feeling warm/hot).</li><li>The person's appearance (such as pallor, whether eyes were open or shut).</li><li>Presence or absence of movement during the event (for example, limb-jerking and its duration).</li><li>Whether there was tongue-biting.</li><li>Injury occurring during the event (record site and severity).</li><li>Duration of the event (onset to regaining consciousness).</li><li>Presence or absence of confusion during the recovery period.</li><li>Weakness down one side during the recovery period.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Assess and record:</strong><ul><li>Details of any previous blackouts, including number and frequency.</li><li>The person's medical history and any family history of cardiac disease (including personal history of heart disease and family history of sudden cardiac death).</li><li>Current medication that may have contributed to the blackout (for example, diuretics).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Suspect a possible underlying cardiac cause if there is:</strong><ul><li>An ECG abnormality such as conduction abnormality (for example, complete right or left bundle branch block or any degree of heart block), evidence of a long (corrected QT > 450 ms) or short (corrected QT < 350 ms) QT interval, any ST segment or T wave abnormalities, inappropriate persistent bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmia (including ventricular ectopic beats), Brugada syndrome, ventricular pre-excitation (part of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), left or right ventricular hypertrophy, pathological Q waves, atrial arrhythmia (sustained), paced rhythm.</li><li>Suspected/confirmed heart failure (suggested by breathlessness, fluid retention, and fatigue. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/heart-failure-chronic/\">Heart failure - chronic</a>).</li><li>Blackout occurring during exertion. However, note that blackouts that are exercise-induced but occur shortly after stopping exercise rather than during exercise may be vasovagal in origin (see below).</li><li>Palpitations before loss of consciousness.</li><li>A family history of sudden cardiac death in people aged younger than 40 years and/or an inherited cardiac condition.</li><li>New or unexplained breathlessness.</li><li>A heart murmur.</li><li>Blackout without prodromal symptoms in people aged older than 65 years.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Suspect epilepsy as an underlying cause if there is:</strong><ul><li>Prodromal déjà vu, or jamais vu.</li><li>A bitten tongue.</li><li>Head-turning to one side during the blackout.</li><li>Loss of bowel and bladder control.</li><li>Unusual posturing.</li><li>Prolonged limb-jerking.</li><li>Confusion following the event.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Suspect an uncomplicated faint (uncomplicated vasovagal syncope) if there is:</strong><ul><li>An absence of features to suggest an alternative diagnosis (note: brief seizure activity can occur during uncomplicated faints and is not necessarily diagnostic of epilepsy) <strong>and</strong></li><li>The presence of features suggestive of uncomplicated faint (the 3 'P's):<ul><li><strong>P</strong>osture — blackout occurred after prolonged standing. Similar episodes may have been prevented by lying down.</li><li><strong>P</strong>rovoking factors — such as pain or a medical procedure.</li><li><strong>P</strong>rodromal symptoms — such as sweating or feeling warm/hot before the blackout occurred.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Suspect situational syncope if:</strong><ul><li>There are no features to suggest an alternative diagnosis <strong>and</strong></li><li>Syncope is clearly and consistently provoked by straining during micturition (usually while standing), defecation, or by coughing or swallowing.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Suspect carotid sinus syndrome if </strong>the blackout(s) occurred while turning the head to one side, particularly in men aged 50 years or older.</li><li><strong>Suspect orthostatic hypotension if there is:</strong><ul><li>An absence of features suggesting an alternative diagnosis <strong>and</strong></li><li>A typical history — light-headedness, dizziness, weakness, tunnel vision. Symptoms should not occur while supine, should get worse on standing, and should be relieved by sitting or lying down. Some people may present with recurrent or unexplained falls. Symptoms are often worse early in the morning, in hot environments, after meals, after standing motionless, and after exercise.<ul><li>If the above criteria are met, measure lying and standing blood pressure (with repeated measurements while standing for 3 minutes). A fall in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg (at least 30 mmHg in people with hypertension) and/or a fall in diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing confirms the diagnosis.</li></ul></li><li>Note: potential underlying causes for orthostatic hypotension include treatment with alpha-blockers, diuretics, tricyclic antidepressants, antihypertensives (particularly diuretics), levodopa or dopaminergic agonists, volume depletion, physical deconditioning due to prolonged bed rest, diseases causing peripheral neuropathy (such as diabetes mellitus), Parkinson's disease, or Lewy body dementia. Polypharmacy with antihypertensive and antidepressant medicines is often the cause of orthostatic hypotension in older people.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Consider differential diagnoses</strong> whose symptoms mimic blackout but which may not involve loss of consciousness, such as falls, psychogenic pseudosyncope or psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (suggested by frequent, recurrent episodes often with a long duration of apparent loss of consciousness, the nature of the events changing over time, and multiple unexplained physical symptoms in a person who may have generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder, somatisation disorder, or major depression), or transient ischaemic attacks. Migraine is uncommonly associated with syncope. For further information, see the CKS topics on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/falls-risk-assessment/\">Falls - risk assessment</a> and <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/migraine/\">Migraine</a>. However, note that If there is uncertainty after initial assessment whether or not a true blackout has occurred, the event should be assumed to be a blackout until proven otherwise.</li><li><strong>Be aware that people</strong> <strong>with multiple comorbidities may have several equally probable causes of blackout, for example, people with severe heart disease are also potential candidates for vasovagal faints. Also, be aware that in up to one third of cases, the underlying cause of blackout will not be determined. </strong></li></ul><!-- end field ca954d2a-8c02-4f0e-a008-a8e200a56d6f --><!-- end item fb8b28b8-48eb-47a9-95b7-a8e200a56d6f -->","topic":{"id":"7ae86ab4-9e3c-50ca-be9f-1b3b4b405d53","topicId":"dfaf6dc0-3eb9-4cb8-8e39-a8e200a549d5","topicName":"Blackouts","slug":"blackouts","lastRevised":"Last revised in November 2018","chapters":[{"id":"77258bcc-a42c-522c-a429-4b282d3a7fd7","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"46891f78-9c37-5070-9619-2eb0a715b435","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"4060ca53-5193-5177-aa7a-51bb970b9a0f","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"3a82ceba-e3d5-561d-b203-33ded4b7d3af","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"776b6eb6-7fc4-55ca-a936-74d2078aa06d","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"6d7e97c7-aae9-5966-8802-2399d57581d5","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"3b6b8ee4-38a6-58c7-836c-8b20099ea6dd","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"0fa8716c-7251-523c-a785-803221f8b8b1","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"bcc0dfae-0f75-506b-b50c-aa80fe11c239","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"ca5616ca-aa5c-5530-af40-a3b14c8beb25","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"39eb6b6a-54a9-5601-85e7-67566690f47b","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
