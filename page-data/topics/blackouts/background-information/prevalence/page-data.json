A further study of 711 adults aged over 70 years in a nursing home reported a ten-year prevalence of blackouts of 23%.</li><li>Approximately 1% of accident and emergency department visits in Europe are thought to be due to blackouts.</li><li>A large meta-analysis of 11 studies that included 43,315 people presenting to emergency departments with syncope found that the most frequent diagnosis was 'situational, orthostatic or vasovagal syncope' in 29% of cases. Heart disease was diagnosed in 10.4% of people, most frequently bradyarrhythmia (4.8%) and tachyarrhythmia (2.6%). One third of people were discharged without a diagnosis.</li><li>Vasovagal syncope tends to peak in frequency in young adults and then again in older people. Most studies suggest that females (especially younger females) are more susceptible to vasovagal faints, although reporting bias may play a role, as young males may be less inclined to report such events.</li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/blackouts/references/\">Lipsitz et al, 1985</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/blackouts/references/\">Savage et al, 1085</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/blackouts/references/\">D'Ascenzo et al, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/blackouts/references/\">NICE, 2014a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/blackouts/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2018b</a>]</p><!-- end field 55a8da71-1a76-4a7a-a492-a99600d411cd --><!-- end item 3d2c87d1-a9b0-4c80-8402-a99600d41177 -->","topic":{"id":"7ae86ab4-9e3c-50ca-be9f-1b3b4b405d53","topicId":"dfaf6dc0-3eb9-4cb8-8e39-a8e200a549d5","topicName":"Blackouts","slug":"blackouts","lastRevised":"Last revised in November 2018","chapters":[{"id":"77258bcc-a42c-522c-a429-4b282d3a7fd7","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"46891f78-9c37-5070-9619-2eb0a715b435","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"4060ca53-5193-5177-aa7a-51bb970b9a0f","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"3a82ceba-e3d5-561d-b203-33ded4b7d3af","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"776b6eb6-7fc4-55ca-a936-74d2078aa06d","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"6d7e97c7-aae9-5966-8802-2399d57581d5","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"3b6b8ee4-38a6-58c7-836c-8b20099ea6dd","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"0fa8716c-7251-523c-a785-803221f8b8b1","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"bcc0dfae-0f75-506b-b50c-aa80fe11c239","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"ca5616ca-aa5c-5530-af40-a3b14c8beb25","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"39eb6b6a-54a9-5601-85e7-67566690f47b","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP - Options for local implementation"},{"id":"cbf59333-11cf-5746-8685-f213c254c757","slug":"nice-quality-standards","fullItemName":"NICE quality standards"}]},{"id":"20ca6df6-ba9a-5c20-9755-70a3749d3050","fullItemName":"Background information","slug":"background-information","subChapters":[{"id":"99021051-5ee1-5f4d-834e-a25d5081d7aa","slug":"definition","fullItemName":"Definition"},{"id":"76a9ff4a-ae16-588a-8586-98e68c071063","slug":"causes","fullItemName":"Causes"},{"id":"0df426a3-efde-538e-8f7f-6a6878ebdf30","slug":"prevalence","fullItemName":"Prevalence"},{"id":"82fec9bd-5cef-51c7-b887-143530af7de8","slug":"complications-prognosis","fullItemName":"Complications and prognosis"}]},{"id":"329c083d-0966-5477-a42e-a0f1ccb29f57","fullItemName":"Diagnosis","slug":"diagnosis","subChapters":[{"id":"1bf8c8ad-479f-5940-9471-d8960790ff6c","slug":"diagnosis","fullItemName":"Diagnosis"}]},{"id":"602695a2-018b-5bca-b12c-37c679104cce","fullItemName":"Management","slug":"management","subChapters":[{"id":"eb300938-6807-5132-a19b-de4b196d6318","slug":"management","fullItemName":"Scenario: Management"}]},{"id":"ba09e432-0101-533a-a61c-19bc6f3d823e","fullItemName":"Supporting evidence","slug":"supporting-evidence","subChapters":[]},{"id":"cf7ce5b5-9560-5190-b78a-57a96e7b3ed7","fullItemName":"How this topic was developed","slug":"how-this-topic-was-developed","subChapters":[{"id":"54fe377c-4ce9-5b29-8488-9b7b66671a2b","slug":"search-strategy","fullItemName":"Search strategy"},{"id":"d9ca1e32-add6-5b2c-9639-f7143a928c4c","slug":"stakeholder-engagement","fullItemName":"Stakeholder engagement"},{"id":"b475c31b-5cf3-5204-8d29-196be0050088","slug":"evidence-exclusion-criteria","fullItemName":"Evidence exclusion criteria"},{"id":"8effac3c-638d-5215-9bb5-e182c5ede19d","slug":"organizational-behavioural-financial-barriers","fullItemName":"Organizational, behavioural and financial barriers"},{"id":"3a1ed41d-1f09-55c9-a3ab-809707193742","slug":"declarations-of-interest","fullItemName":"Declarations of interest"}]},{"id":"6400b0f9-db3b-5600-b5cd-f48938305976","fullItemName":"References","slug":"references","subChapters":[]}]},"parentChapter":{"id":"20ca6df6-ba9a-5c20-9755-70a3749d3050","slug":"background-information","fullItemName":"Background information"},"subChapters":[]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
