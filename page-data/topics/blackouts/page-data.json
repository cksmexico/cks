In the UK, 1 in 2 people will experience a blackout at some point in their life, with the most common underlying cause being vasovagal syncope.</li><li>Diagnosing the underlying cause of a blackout will usually include:<ul><li>Assessment of vital signs, measurement of lying and standing blood pressure, and recording an ECG.</li><li>Documenting details of the event (from a witness if possible).</li><li>Determining whether there have been any previous blackouts, considering the person's medical and family history of cardiac disease/sudden cardiac death, reviewing whether any current medication may have contributed to the blackout.</li></ul></li><li>Vasovagal syncope is suggested by an absence of features to suggest an alternative diagnosis and the presence of features suggestive of uncomplicated faint (the 3 'P's):<ul><li>Posture – blackout occurred after prolonged standing.</li><li>Provoking factors — such as pain or a medical procedure.</li><li>Prodromal symptoms — such as sweating or feeling warm/hot before the blackout.</li></ul></li><li>Orthostatic hypotension is suggested by an absence of features suggesting an alternative diagnosis and a typical history including; light-headedness, dizziness, weakness, tunnel vision, certain medical conditions and/or drug treatments. Symptoms get worse on standing and are relieved by sitting or lying down. A fall in systolic blood pressure of at least 20 mmHg (at least 30 mmHg in people with hypertension) and/or a fall in diastolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing confirms the diagnosis.</li><li>An underlying cardiac cause is suggested by ECG abnormality, evidence of heart failure, blackouts occurring during exertion, palpitations before loss of consciousness, a family history of sudden cardiac death in people aged younger than 40 years and/or an inherited cardiac condition, new or unexplained breathlessness, and/or a heart murmur.</li><li>Epilepsy is suggested by a bitten tongue, head-turning to one side during the blackout, loss of bowel and bladder control, unusual posturing, prolonged limb-jerking, confusion following the event, and prodromal déjà vu, or jamais vu.</li><li>People with suspected vasovagal syncope should be offered information and advice on their condition, possible trigger events, and strategies for avoiding them, and reassured that their prognosis is good.</li><li>People with orthostatic hypotension should be offered information on their condition and advised of simple lifestyle changes that can improve their symptoms. Specialist referral for the initiation of drug therapy may be required if these measures do not improve symptoms.</li><li>People with a suspected cardiac cause should be referred urgently for cardiac assessment, with the referral reviewed and prioritised by an appropriate specialist within 24 hours.</li><li>People with suspected epilepsy should be referred to a specialist for neurological assessment within two weeks.</li><li>People awaiting specialist assessment should be advised not to drive.</li></ul><!-- end field 8fb80685-c058-4919-979e-a8e200a56d6f --><!-- end item d7014ff8-a35c-4577-949a-a8e200a56d6f -->","topic":{"id":"7ae86ab4-9e3c-50ca-be9f-1b3b4b405d53","topicId":"dfaf6dc0-3eb9-4cb8-8e39-a8e200a549d5","topicName":"Blackouts","slug":"blackouts","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"77258bcc-a42c-522c-a429-4b282d3a7fd7","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"46891f78-9c37-5070-9619-2eb0a715b435","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"4060ca53-5193-5177-aa7a-51bb970b9a0f","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"3a82ceba-e3d5-561d-b203-33ded4b7d3af","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"776b6eb6-7fc4-55ca-a936-74d2078aa06d","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"6d7e97c7-aae9-5966-8802-2399d57581d5","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"3b6b8ee4-38a6-58c7-836c-8b20099ea6dd","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"0fa8716c-7251-523c-a785-803221f8b8b1","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"bcc0dfae-0f75-506b-b50c-aa80fe11c239","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"ca5616ca-aa5c-5530-af40-a3b14c8beb25","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"39eb6b6a-54a9-5601-85e7-67566690f47b","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
