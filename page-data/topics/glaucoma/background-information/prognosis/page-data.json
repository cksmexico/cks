With treatment (that aimed to reduce IOP by 20% or more and to reach 24 mmHg or less), the risk reduced to 4.4% [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glaucoma/references/\">Kass, 2002</a>].</li></ul></li></ul></li><li> <strong>Primary open angle glaucoma</strong><ul><li>Without treatment, POAG typically progresses slowly, over years, and most people are asymptomatic until late in the disease. Visual field defects do not appear until most of the optic nerve fibres have been damaged. However, the rate of progression is variable [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glaucoma/references/\">King, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glaucoma/references/\">Bowling, 2015</a>].<ul><li>Typically, as glaucoma progresses, visual loss is peripheral at first. Peripheral vision is important for detecting movement outside the area of focus and is therefore necessary for safe driving. Severe loss of the peripheral visual field results in tunnel vision. </li><li>Central vision tends to be affected later, which affects reading and other activities that require focussed vision. </li><li>Most people with POAG will not go blind (blindness of both eyes eventually develops in about 5–10% of people with POAG) but will develop varying degrees of visual loss and visual field defects. </li><li>Any vision that is lost because of glaucoma cannot be restored. </li></ul></li><li>With treatment, there is delay in the progression of glaucoma and most people on treatment will not go blind [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glaucoma/references/\">King, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glaucoma/references/\">Bowling, 2015</a>].</li><li>One study followed up 20 people who were still alive 20 years after being diagnosed with (and had been receiving appropriate treatment for) POAG. On visual field analysis, nearly half (48.9%) of eyes did not deteriorate, but 28.3% of eyes deteriorated by more than two stages. The authors concluded that 'in most older patients with glaucoma, the overall goal of preventing visual handicap and blindness is achievable 20 years after diagnosis' [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glaucoma/references/\">King, 2018</a>].<ul><li>Note: a main factor to a poorer outcome is non-compliance with treatment. About one-third of people who are prescribed eye drops for glaucoma for the first time fail to continue collecting prescriptions within the first year. Possible causes for this include: forgetfulness, poly-pharmacy, difficulties using eye drops, and poor understanding of the need for treatment in people who see no immediate benefit [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glaucoma/references/\">Waterman, 2013</a>].</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Primary angle closure glaucoma</strong><ul><li>Without treatment — although PACG is much less common than POAG, it accounts for half of glaucoma-related blindness in the world [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glaucoma/references/\">Wright, 2016</a>].</li><li>With prompt treatment, the outlook is good. Outlook can depend on how early the condition is diagnosed and treated [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glaucoma/references/\">Khondkaryan, 2013</a>]. </li><li>An untreated fellow eye (the eye not currently affected) has a 40–80% chance of developing an acute episode of angle closure over the next 5–10 years [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/glaucoma/references/\">Khondkaryan, 2013</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field f0d19764-d66a-4041-a1d2-07e7fb45b3d2 --><!-- end item c0804978-9dbb-4022-960d-5b0e7ae02ea6 -->","topic":{"id":"2f2ce020-977b-56c2-bfe0-79af338099b2","topicId":"3f1d1b43-0970-4917-b518-15a04dfd4397","topicName":"Glaucoma","slug":"glaucoma","lastRevised":"Last revised in November 2020","chapters":[{"id":"b70753e1-40bf-5d64-8042-80499a3a3663","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"99932988-c7ac-5201-8a03-324771c52186","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"4665a282-8076-541c-8fdb-d884f514e73a","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"90547efd-385b-5418-95dc-840a239bb4b6","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"744db240-54ad-5b2b-bde1-fbf5f82dd75c","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"1b9b2a0b-c1eb-5850-81a4-594deb443996","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"d96d012a-8a50-5197-a3bc-80be922d4ec3","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"ab168d63-48cb-5e39-af87-b20be5416a2b","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"1371aed7-3648-50af-9b62-765d61209340","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"e5d9b1dc-20e2-5c90-807b-c86643d03e27","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"634d007b-489f-5899-be8c-e79e2c12d416","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
