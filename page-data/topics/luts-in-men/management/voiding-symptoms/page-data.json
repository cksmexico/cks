Although this difference was statistically significant, the 95% confidence interval included the minimum clinically important difference. More men treated with alpha-blockers than placebo experienced dizziness, fatigue (asthenia), postural hypotension, rhinitis, erectile dysfunction, and abnormal ejaculation.</li><li>Economic studies identified by NICE found that alpha-blockers were more cost effective than placebo or no treatment in men with moderate or severe LUTS. NICE assessed the results as having minor limitations and being only partially applicable.</li><li>Based on these, NICE concluded that alpha-blockers are cost effective for men with moderate-to-severe voiding LUTS and that their benefits outweigh the possible adverse effects.</li></ul></li><li>The EAU also supports the recommendation to offer an alpha-blocker to men with moderate to severe LUTS with predominantly voiding symptoms. This recommendation is based on evidence from a range of RCTs which showed that alpha-blockers are effective in reducing urinary symptoms and increasing the peak urinary flow rate compared with placebo [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">European Association of Urology, 2018</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to offer alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, or terazosin is based on the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2015</a>].<ul><li>NICE reviewed the evidence for alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, and terazosin as they are commonly used, and excluded studies with indoramin, prazosin, and phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride as these are older drugs that are now little used [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2015</a>]. </li><li>Indirect and limited direct comparisons between alpha-blockers, identified by the EAU, showed that all alpha-blockers have a similar efficacy in appropriate dosages [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">European Association of Urology, 2018</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The recommendations on follow up and monitoring are based on the expert opinion of the NICE guideline development group (GDG) as no relevant clinical trials were identified.</li></ul><h5>Offering a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor</h5><ul><li>NICE reviewed the evidence on the use of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors in men with LUTS [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2015</a>]. <ul><li>Evidence from RCTs showed that:<ul><li>5-alpha reductase inhibitors are less effective than alpha-blockers in improving symptom scores and maximum urine flow in men with prostates estimated to be less than 30 mL, but were more effective in men with larger prostates (at least 30 mL, and 55 mL on average).</li><li>Compared with alpha-blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors are less likely to cause orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, fatigue or weakness, and rhinitis, but are more likely to cause decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and breast enlargement.</li></ul></li><li>The NICE GDG concluded that 5-alpha reductase inhibitors may be cost-effective for men with large prostates and that their benefits outweigh the adverse effects.</li></ul></li><li>The EAU also supports the recommendation to offer a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor to men with moderate-to-severe LUTS and an enlarged prostate or increased risk of disease progression. Evidence identified by the EAU showed that [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">European Association of Urology, 2018</a>]:<ul><li>After 2–4 years of treatment, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors improve International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) by approximately 15–30% and decrease prostate volume by 18–28%, in men with LUTS due to prostate enlargement.</li><li>5-alpha reductase inhibitors can prevent disease progression and the need for surgery. However, they are suitable only for long-term treatment (years) because of their slow onset of action.</li></ul></li><li>Dutasteride and finasteride are equally effective for relieving LUTS associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men with larger prostates. They have similar adverse effect profiles, and both have a slow onset of action [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2015</a>].  <ul><li>CKS identified a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of dutasteride for the treatment of symptomatic BPH (11 studies, n = 12,129) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">Park and Choi, 2014</a>]. Dutasteride was compared with placebo and finasteride. There was no significant difference between dutasteride and finasteride for symptom improvement or rate of adverse effects.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendations on follow up and monitoring are based on expert opinion as NICE found no relevant clinical trials.</li></ul><h5>Offering a combination of an alpha-blocker and a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor</h5><ul><li>NICE based this recommendation on the expert opinion of the GDG after weighing up the evidence on benefits, adverse effects, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness of a combination treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2015</a>]. <ul><li>RCTs found that alpha-blocker plus 5-alpha reductase inhibitor combinations are more effective than alpha-blockers alone in improving symptom scores at 2–4 years' follow up. The combination was not more effective at 6 months or 1 year.</li><li>Men treated with alpha-blocker plus 5-alpha reductase inhibitor combinations were more likely than men treated with alpha-blockers alone to experience adverse effects (such as decreased libido, ejaculatory abnormalities, and erectile dysfunction).</li><li>NICE concluded that combined treatment with an alpha-blocker and a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor may be more cost effective than treatment with an alpha-blocker alone in selected men who are at higher risk of progression because of older age, more severe/bothersome symptoms, or greater prostate size.</li></ul></li><li>The EAU also supports the recommendation to offer combination treatment with an alpha-blocker and a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor to men with moderate-to-severe LUTS and an increased risk of disease progression (for example prostate volume more than 40 mL). This recommendation is based on evidence from a range of RCTs which showed that [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">European Association of Urology, 2018</a>]:<ul><li>Combination treatment is superior to monotherapy for symptoms and peak urinary flow rate, and superior to an alpha-blocker alone in reducing the risk of acute urinary retention or need for surgery.</li><li>The risk of long-term clinical progression (primarily due to increasing IPSS) was reduced by 66% with combined treatment compared with placebo and to a greater extent than with either finasteride or doxazosin monotherapy.</li><li>After 4 years, combination treatment reduced the relative risks of acute urinary retention, BPH-related surgery, and symptom deterioration compared with tamsulosin alone.</li></ul></li><li>CKS identified a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of dutasteride for the treatment of symptomatic BPH (11 studies, n = 12,129). Four trials compared dutasteride plus tamsulosin with tamsulosin alone [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">Park and Choi, 2014</a>].<ul><li>Combination treatment with dutasteride and tamsulosin resulted in significantly greater improvement in symptoms scores and urinary flow rates compared with tamsulosin alone.</li><li>Erectile dysfunction and decreased libido were more common in the combination group compared with the tamsulosin only group. Retrograde ejaculation was more common in the combination treatment group; however, this difference was not statistically significant.

However, there was no difference in the proportions of men whose Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) score improved.</li><li>Minor adverse effects (such as dry mouth) are common with antimuscarinics. Urinary retention is a serious possible adverse effect, but NICE found no evidence that this risk is clinically important [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2015</a>]. </li></ul></li><li>The EAU also supports the recommendation to use combination treatment of an alpha-blocker plus an antimuscarinic drug in people with moderate-to-severe LUTS if relief of storage symptoms has been insufficient with monotherapy with either drug. Evidence identified by the EAU showed that [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">European Association of Urology, 2018</a>]:<ul><li>Combination treatment with an alpha-blocker and an antimuscarinic drug is more effective for reducing urgency, urgency urinary incontinence, voiding frequency, nocturia, or IPSS compared with alpha-blocker or placebo alone.</li><li>Combination treatment with an alpha-blocker and an antimuscarinic drug is effective for improving LUTS-related quality of life impairment.</li><li>There is a low risk of acute urinary retention using an alpha-blocker and an antimuscarinic drug in men known to have a post-void residual urine volume of less than 150 mL. The EAU therefore recommends that antimuscarinics should be avoided in men with a post-void residual volume more than 150 mL. </li></ul></li><li>Expert opinion in the British National Formulary (BNF) is that the need for continuing treatment for urinary incontinence should be reviewed every 4–6 weeks until symptoms stabilise, and then every 6–12 months [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">BNF 76, 2018</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field 65775ad5-93c3-411f-ab2d-81485b1c77b2 --><!-- end item 54d9e65d-daa0-44c0-93b1-0b507617eb68 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
