The best trial-based evidence identified by NICE was from one small randomized controlled trial (RCT) which reported the data graphically and without statistical analysis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2015</a>].<ul><li>The evidence showed that antimuscarinics reduced the number of urinary incontinence episodes compared with placebo (but not compared with alpha-blockers). There were no other improvements noted compared with placebo. NICE considered the reduction in the number of incontinence episodes as an important benefit.</li><li>Minor adverse effects (such as dry mouth) are common with antimuscarinic drugs. Urinary retention is a serious possible adverse effect, but NICE found no evidence that this risk is clinically important.</li></ul></li><li>The EAU also supports this recommendation based on evidence from four post-hoc analysis from four large RCTs and a range of observational studies [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">European Association of Urology, 2018</a>].</li><li>CKS found no guidance on the choice of antimuscarinic drugs in men with LUTS. The recommended choices have been extrapolated from the NICE guideline <em>Urinary incontinence: the management of urinary incontinence in women </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>].<ul><li>For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/\">Incontinence - urinary, in women</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Offering mirabegron</h5><ul><li>NICE recommends mirabegron as a treatment for people with overactive bladder symptoms in whom antimuscarinic drugs are contraindicated, ineffective, or not tolerated<em> </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>]. NICE based this recommendation on evidence from the technology appraisal <a data-hyperlink-id=\"d7fa79e8-c17c-4443-ac84-aa1e00d8719e\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta290\">Mirabegron for treating symptoms of overactive bladder</a> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">NICE, 2013b</a>].<ul><li>The evidence showed that mirabegron, as with all antimuscarinic drugs, offers modest improvements compared with placebo. However, it was uncertain whether it had equivalent efficacy to the other antimuscarinics.</li><li>The rate of adverse effects were no different between mirabegron and tolterodine tartrate 4 mg, but the nature of the adverse effects differed. For example, dry mouth was more common with tolterodine tartrate than with mirabegron. The appraisal committee concluded that the different adverse effect profile of mirabegron would be of benefit for people who cannot tolerate the specific adverse effects of antimuscarinic drugs, particularly dry mouth.</li><li>The cost effectiveness of mirabegron when compared with other antimuscarinic drugs was uncertain. However, the appraisal committee concluded that mirabegron was likely to be a cost-effective treatment for people with overactive bladder for whom antimuscarinics are contraindicated, ineffective, or not tolerated.</li></ul></li><li>CKS identified a systematic review (44 RCTs, n = 27,309) which studied the changes in symptoms (micturition frequency, incontinence, and urgency incontinence episodes) and reported adverse effects (dry mouth and constipation) in people with overactive bladder symptoms [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">Maman et al, 2014</a>].<ul><li>The following drugs were compared with mirabegron: darifenacin, tolterodine (immediate release and extended release), oxybutynin (immediate release and extended release), trospium, solifenacin, and fesoterodine.</li><li>Mirabegron showed a similar efficacy to most antimuscarinic drugs and a lower incidence of dry mouth.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation to review people on mirabegron at 4–6 weeks to assess tolerability and efficacy is based on the opinion of the previous expert reviewers of this CKS topic.</li></ul><!-- end field e51b43c7-b330-4f8e-b572-20be1704ad22 --><!-- end item 95721adc-627b-483f-b10c-a71f44711de6 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
