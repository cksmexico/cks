The evidence showed that [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">Han, 2017</a>]:<ul><li>Compared with placebo, desmopressin may reduce the number of nocturnal voids by a small amount compared with placebo in intermediate‐term follow up (3–12 months) without increasing major adverse effects. In short‐term follow‐up (up to 3 months), desmopressin may result in a small, possibly unimportant effect on the number of nocturnal voids.</li><li>Compared with an alpha-blocker, desmopressin likely has a similar effect on the number of nocturnal voids and quality of life measured on the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) scale. There were no major adverse events in either group.</li><li>Combination treatment with desmopressin plus an alpha‐blocker likely results in a small, unimportant effect on the number of nocturnal voids and quality of life compared with alpha-blocker alone in short‐term follow‐up (up to 3 months). However, the risk of major adverse events may be similar.</li><li>Combination treatment with desmopressin plus an alpha-blocker likely results in little or no difference in the number of nocturnal voids compared with combination treatment with an alpha‐blocker plus an anticholinergic drug in short‐term follow‐up (up to 3 months).
