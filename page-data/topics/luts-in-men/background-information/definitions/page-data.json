Only 25–50% of men with BPH have LUTS and often the predominant problem is voiding symptoms [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2015</a>].</li><li><strong>Benign prostatic enlargement </strong>—<strong> </strong>describes enlargement of the prostate gland by BPH. Only about 50% of men with BPH develop benign prostatic enlargement [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2015</a>].</li><li><strong>Bladder outlet obstruction </strong>— the generic term for obstruction during voiding. It is diagnosed when urodynamic voiding studies show increased detrusor (bladder wall muscle) pressure and reduced urine flow rate.</li><li><strong>Overactive bladder </strong>— a syndrome (symptom complex) of storage symptoms, including urinary urgency, with or without urgency incontinence; frequency; and nocturia. Both stress incontinence and overflow incontinence are excluded from the definition of overactive bladder. Overactive bladder symptoms are usually caused by bladder (detrusor) overactivity but can be due to other forms of voiding dysfunction.</li><li><strong>Detrusor overactivity </strong>—<strong> </strong>a urodynamic observation characterized by involuntary detrusor contractions during the bladder filling phase which may be spontaneous or provoked. Detrusor overactivity occurs in approximately 65% of men presenting with overactive bladder symptoms and 50% of men with bladder outlet obstruction [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2015</a>].</li><li><strong>Acute urinary retention </strong>—<strong> </strong>abrupt (over a period of hours) development of the inability to pass urine. It is associated with increasing pain and the presence of a distended bladder which can usually be palpated on examination.</li><li><strong>Chronic urinary retention </strong>— gradual (over months or years) development of the inability to empty the bladder completely. It is associated with the presence of a distended bladder which can usually be palpated on examination.</li><li><strong>Acute on chronic retention </strong>— abrupt development of acute urinary retention in a man who has previously had chronic urinary retention.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Terms such as 'prostatism', 'symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia', and 'clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia' </strong>have been used to describe LUTS in men. However, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends that the term 'lower urinary tract symptoms' is used instead to dispel the popular perception that urinary symptoms in men invariably arise from the prostate [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2015</a>].</li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/luts-in-men/references/\">European Association of Urology, 2018</a>]</p><!-- end field b1e9cd17-c95a-47f1-a244-cebab4965c48 --><!-- end item 9445b964-32c1-4e4a-87ff-44235a7ecbc2 -->","topic":{"id":"fdcce69d-578e-5994-a7c2-84be40932dd8","topicId":"a7bf3f2d-1d9e-47c0-9dd3-26731c4d092b","topicName":"LUTS in men","slug":"luts-in-men","lastRevised":"Last revised in March 2019","chapters":[{"id":"149361eb-636f-59a5-a2e2-b067d629a065","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"c7972342-637c-56a9-8783-c1e8314e7fd1","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"7105be47-f38b-5335-b14d-69db43326579","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"c8165ab8-59af-557d-824d-58f09041698f","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"776566d2-009e-5ebd-ac21-e5605029213a","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"4c1332b1-3f4f-530f-bb70-d627804caa79","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"d434ba09-30c6-5bfc-bb6f-87e952a1b33a","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"702b01d3-71e8-5daf-a985-3935596391f5","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"0aef110d-14b4-5ae2-9da0-a07cc4aef9ef","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"7fcf6ae7-162e-5b90-84fb-2a79f82d420e","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"1c91c138-4e44-571e-8ac0-8e62f8dca310","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
