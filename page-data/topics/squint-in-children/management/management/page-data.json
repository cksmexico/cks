With the common accommodative esotropia, the squint too is fully correctable with glasses. An annual refraction is required to monitor changes in the prescription for the glasses. Many hypermetropic children can see clearly without their glasses but only by accommodating, which makes them squint. The aim of the glasses is to straighten their eyes and not necessarily to help them see better.</li><li>Occlusion therapy, to treat amblyopia (lazy eye) — this involves occlusion of the normal eye with a patch or occlusive glasses to encourage the use of the amblyopic eye. It is usually effective. The patch is usually worn part-time, the number of hours per day depending on the age of the child and the severity of the amblyopia. </li><li>Penalization therapy — vision in the normal eye is deliberately blurred by using <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/squint-in-children/prescribing-information/atropine-eye-drops/\">atropine drops</a> to force the child to use their amblyopic eye. It tends to be used when compliance with occlusion is problematic.</li><li>Eye exercises — these may be appropriate for some intermittent squints. However, they are not effective for most squints.</li><li>Surgery — by altering the point of the insertion of an extra-ocular muscle into the sclera, or by shortening an extra-ocular muscle, the misalignment of a squinting eye can be corrected. There are various techniques, and the muscle(s) operated on depend on the type of squint. Surgery may be performed on one or both eyes. Sometimes two or more operations are required to get a successful alignment of the eyes, but successful surgery often reduces the size of the squint rather than fully correcting it.</li><li>Botulinum toxin — an injection of botulinum toxin into an extraocular muscle can cause paralysis of the muscle for up to 3 months and correct a squint. This may be used in certain circumstances, for example for people who have had multiple squint operations but who still have misaligned eyes. It can also be used under general anaesthetic for some childhood squints.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/squint-in-children/references/\">Royal College of Ophthalmologists, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/squint-in-children/references/\">Bowling, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/squint-in-children/references/\">Sawers, 2017</a>]  [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/squint-in-children/references/\">Bommireddy, 2020</a>]</p><!-- end field 231324be-4945-4e48-9b85-166c5fea8976 --><!-- end item 013b8acb-e335-40ac-9429-d88f9032cf3d -->","subChapters":[]},{"id":"b529d730-f5db-52a3-a023-726e65ed746d","slug":"basis-for-recommendation-029","fullItemName":"Basis for recommendation","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 7e35f6c5-bb04-42bb-a607-24c453fbce79 --><h4>Basis for recommendation</h4><!-- end field 7e35f6c5-bb04-42bb-a607-24c453fbce79 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 0293849c-57a2-40fa-a2cd-a1dce12c7f36 --><!-- begin field a36560f3-669b-4031-9029-697269ea5fa6 --><p>These recommendations are based on expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/squint-in-children/references/\">Marsh, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/squint-in-children/references/\">Sawers, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/squint-in-children/references/\">Martin, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/squint-in-children/references/\">Bommireddy, 2020</a>] and in the textbook <em>Kanski's Clinical Ophthalmology 8th Edition </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/squint-in-children/references/\">Bowling, 2015</a>]<em>. </em></p><ul><li>Prompt identification and investigation of squint are necessary as it can be secondary to serious underlying intracranial, intraorbital, or intraocular pathology [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/squint-in-children/references/\">Sawers, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/squint-in-children/references/\">Bommireddy, 2020</a>].</li><li>Most squints in children will be benign and can be referred for further investigation on a routine basis.
