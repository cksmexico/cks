Can be worse towards the end of the day or with fatigue.</li></ul></li><li><strong>The direction of the deviation:</strong><ul><li>Horizontal deviation — this can be further classified as esotropia (or esophoria), where one or both eyes turn inwards (convergent squint), and exotropia (or exophoria), where one or both eyes turn outwards (divergent squint).</li><li>Vertical deviation — this can be further classified as hypertropia, where one or both eyes turn upward (upward squint), and hypotropia, where one or both eyes turn downward (downward squint).</li><li>Cyclotorsional — rotation of an eye around its visual axis.</li></ul></li><li><strong>The fusional status:</strong><ul><li>Manifest squint (tropia) — seen when no fusional control is present. There is a deviation of one eye whilst the other eye takes up fixation, meaning that when one eye views the object of interest, the other eye is deviated.</li><li>Latent squint (phoria) — fusional control is present and there is normal ocular alignment, but the squint occurs only when the use of the two eyes together is interrupted, for example by covering one eye. </li></ul></li><li><strong>The laterality:</strong><ul><li>Unilateral — there is a definite preference for fixation of vision with one eye; therefore, the squint always appears to be in the other eye. </li><li>Alternating — there is an alternation of fixation of vision from one eye to the other; therefore, the squint can alternate from one eye to the other.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Variation with gaze position:</strong><ul><li>Comitant (concomitant) — typical of most childhood squints. The ocular deviation can be seen in all directions of gaze by an equal amount. There is no paralysis or limitation of eye movements, but the balance between the muscles in the two eyes has been lost.  </li><li>Incomitant (non-comitant) squint — the degree of deviation varies with the direction of gaze. This may indicate an acquired neurological or muscular disease, causing paresis or paralysis of one or more of the extra-ocular muscles, resulting in limitation of eye movements.</li></ul></li><li><strong>The relationship to accommodation:</strong><ul><li>Accommodative — occurs, or is more obvious, when the child is accommodating and focusing on an object. The child is typically hypermetropic (long-sighted), and the squint can be reduced or corrected if the refractive error is corrected with glasses.</li><li>Non-accommodative — either there is no significant hypermetropia or if hypermetropia is present, there is no change in the angle of the squint with appropriate glasses.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>The common types of childhood squint include </strong><strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/squint-in-children/references/\">Yeung, 2010</a>]</strong> <strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/squint-in-children/references/\">Royal College of Ophthalmologists, 2012</a>]</strong><strong> </strong><strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/squint-in-children/references/\">Bowling, 2015</a>]</strong><strong>:</strong><ul><li><strong>Congenital/infantile squint:</strong><ul><li>Convergent squint is much more common than divergent.</li><li>The angle of the squint is often large. </li><li>Usually, there is no significant refractive error. </li><li>Cross-fixation is frequent. That is, both eyes have good vision, and the child tends to use the right eye to look to the left and the left eye to look to the right. (This is sometimes mistaken for bilateral sixth nerve palsies.) </li><li>Nystagmus may be present. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Accommodative esotropia:</strong><ul><li>Generally, develops sometime between 6 months and 5 years of age, but by 3 years of age in the majority of cases.</li><li>It may begin as an intermittent esotropia, typically when the child is tired or when concentrating on objects close by, and in time becomes constant. </li><li><strong>A fully accommodative esotropia</strong> is fully correctable with glasses for hypermetropia (long-sightedness) and binocular function is present with the glasses on.</li><li><strong>A partially accommodative esotropia</strong> is only partially corrected with glasses for hypermetropia and binocular function is not present.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Non-accommodative esotropia: </strong><ul><li>Most commonly develops sometime between the ages of 2–5 years.</li><li>It may begin as an intermittent esotropia, typically when the child is tired or when concentrating on objects close by, and in time becomes constant. However, onset may be acute. </li><li>Hypermetropia may or may not be present, but the squint is not corrected by correction of any refractive error. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Intermittent distance exotropia (IDEX):</strong><ul><li>It often develops between the ages of 2–5 years, but there is a significant proportion that begin later, and onset can be at any age. </li><li>The squint is intermittent and most commonly observed when the child is tired or in bright sunlight. </li><li>Visual acuity is usually good, and the incidence of refractive errors is no greater than in the general population.</li><li>The control of the squint may be improved by correction of any refractive error, especially myopia and astigmatism.</li><li>The angle of the squint is often greater when looking at distant objects, and the squint may disappear when looking at a near object or when reading. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Other types of squint </strong>that develop as a consequence of neurodevelopmental disorders, other eye diseases, neurological diseases, or diseases that affect the extra-ocular muscles.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field f4c86f65-73ab-4dd5-b870-3f330a7c6805 --><!-- end item f023b03d-aa43-4136-850f-e25002da25a0 -->","topic":{"id":"d25cf803-28cb-5afd-80ca-d97838356e0c","topicId":"3e67bea0-6e2a-4f62-86eb-6e4c56360437","topicName":"Squint in children","slug":"squint-in-children","lastRevised":"Last revised in January 2021","chapters":[{"id":"b8612b38-b5db-56e8-a543-71e5c697b321","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"780c39cc-055a-53cd-bf74-acd28cc88602","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"afd01e9a-2008-5a2c-9539-10fa84545764","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"6b8c8d6d-89ab-5ea0-ae30-60da95a35e26","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"3384a548-18ca-5700-81ca-97f085fa4a41","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"262d6d12-f189-50fe-be83-dc3f7b819c28","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"a04252dd-0eab-51c1-96c3-78aabd585484","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"ed0abb87-47b9-5dc2-a23a-490395a37a51","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"7ce7f3fa-3b9f-5026-a148-0ea285406c0c","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"5250eccf-4fbc-5a72-bab0-669c03e06c58","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"0c7cb979-a236-5b84-99c7-2b9fab653503","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
