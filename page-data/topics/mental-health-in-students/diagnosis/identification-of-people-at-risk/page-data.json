at risk of a mental health problem is largely based on expert opinion in the Royal College of Psychiatrists guideline<em> Mental health of students in higher education </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/mental-health-in-students/references/\">Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2011</a>]. </p><h4>Training</h4><ul><li>The recommendation to ensure that all relevant personnel receive regular training in the assessment and management of young people with mental health problems and are aware of the risk factors is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice, and is also in-line with recommendations made by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) relating generally to healthcare professionals involved in caring for people with depression [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/mental-health-in-students/references/\">NICE, 2011a</a>].</li></ul><h4>Identifying students at risk</h4><ul><li>The recommendation to consider using short questionnaires to identify students at risk of depression and anxiety is pragmatic and is also supported by an expert reviewer of this CKS topic:<ul><li>The expert reviewer recommended the use of a general mental health/wellbeing measure such as SWEMWBS, on the basis that there is some evidence that formal screening for specific conditions can potentially have a negative nocebo-like effect. The reviewer stated that it is important to also note that as most students joining new GP practices will be doing this during the transition into university, they may score as unwell on an outcome measure due to the transient experience of starting university.</li><li>Depression and anxiety are the most common mental health problems experienced by students, and so CKS pragmatically recommends screening specifically for these if clinically appropriate. Short screening questionnaires to detect these conditions and assess severity are widely used in primary care.</li></ul></li><li>The Royal College of Psychiatrists advises that 'most university health practices make active efforts to have new students fully registered in the first few days following enrolment and screen for pre-existing medical conditions, including mental illnesses' [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/mental-health-in-students/references/\">Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2011</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to enquire about a student's mental wellbeing whenever they present for any reason is also pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice. The prevalence of mental health problems in students is high. It is also recognized that some people with mental health problems may present with physical symptoms or may not readily report mental distress. An expert reviewer of this topic advised that formal assessment for specific conditions may have a negative nocebo-like effect, and so general assessment of mental wellbeing may be more appropriate.</li><li>The advice that students may be at particular risk if they have cultivated a good relationship with a GP or mental health practitioner at their home location, or have not been able to access appropriate support prior to starting university, is based on expert opinion in the <em>University Student Mental Health Survey, 2020</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/mental-health-in-students/references/\">The Insight Network, 2020</a>].</li></ul><h4>Communication</h4><ul><li>The recommendations to ensure good communication between home and university healthcare teams and all personnel currently involved in the student's care are largely pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice. </li><li>The Royal College of psychiatrists guideline <em>Mental health of students in higher education</em> also outlines the importance of communication between GPs and student counselling services, disability services, mental health advisors, academic staff, and support services [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/mental-health-in-students/references/\">Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2011</a>].</li></ul><h4>COVID-19</h4><ul><li>The recommendations on identifying students with mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic are pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><!-- end field 138d6a6f-095f-4ab4-99c0-ac1e00a385f8 --><!-- end item 8d545997-391b-4be9-a97f-ac1e00a385f8 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
