Consider asking about:</strong></strong><ul><li><strong>Psychological symptoms</strong> — perceived changes to mood, thoughts, emotions, resilience, perception, and behaviour.</li><li><strong>Physical symptoms</strong> — which may be a feature of a psychological illness, or may suggest a differential diagnosis.<ul><li>Use clinical judgement to determine whether an examination and/or further investigations are necessary.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Academic performance</strong> — declining academic performance can be associated with a burgeoning mental health problem. Perceived failure can also be a trigger for mental health problems in some students. Be aware that a student's cultural background may affect their perception of the importance of success, and feelings of failure and shame.</li><li><strong>Sleep patterns</strong> — poor sleep is commonly seen alongside mental health problems in students and in some cases may be at least partly causal.</li><li><strong>Co-morbidities</strong> — such as chronic illness causing functional impairment, which has been associated with increased risk of some mental health problems.</li><li><strong>Use of over-the-counter or prescribed medications, </strong>whose adverse effects may include changes to mood and behaviour.</li><li><strong>Misuse of alcohol or other recreational substances </strong>— which may contribute to symptoms and/or may be misused as a result of the person's psychological difficulties.</li><li><strong>The person's psychosocial situation </strong>— to determine whether there are any risk factors for particular conditions, and identify triggers for current psychological distress.</li><li><strong>Personal and family history of mental health problems</strong> — to determine the presence of risk factors.</li></ul></li><li><strong><strong>Be aware that in students in secondary education, the most common mental health problems are depression and anxiety.</strong></strong><br><ul><li><strong><strong>Depression</strong> is characterized by </strong>persistent low mood and/or loss of pleasure in most activities and a range of associated emotional, cognitive, physical, and behavioural symptoms. In young adults, depression can have a more insidious onset, and may be characterized by irritability, and low mood. </li><li><strong><strong>Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)</strong> is characterized typically by disproportionate, pervasive, uncontrollable, and widespread worry and a range of somatic, cognitive, and behavioural symptoms that occur on a continuum of severity. </strong><strong>Be aware that: </strong><ul style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><li><strong>People with depression and GAD may present solely with associated physical symptoms. The person may be unaware that these are caused by a mental health problem, </strong>or may not readily report psychological distress.</li><li>Anxiety in students may present in a variety of guises and may sometimes present very specifically (at least initially) for example as social anxiety or exam anxiety.</li><li>For further information please see the CKS topics on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression/\">Depression</a> and <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/generalized-anxiety-disorder/\">Generalized anxiety disorder</a>.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Other mental health problems where onset or exacerbation is common among young people include:</strong><ul><li><strong>Addiction </strong>— should be considered if there is misuse of alcohol, illicit drugs, or the person reports compulsive behaviour such as gambling, excessive shopping, or spending large amounts of time using the internet or gaming. For further information, see the CKS topics on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/alcohol-problem-drinking/\">Alcohol - problem drinking</a> and <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/\">Opioid dependence</a>.</li><li><strong>Psychosis/schizophrenia</strong> — suggested by alternations to a person's perception, thoughts, mood, and behaviour. Features may include hallucinations and delusions; paranoia; lack of spontaneity, mood, drive, and/or pleasure; attention deficit; and/or impoverishment of speech and language. For further information, please see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/psychosis-schizophrenia/\">Psychosis and schizophrenia</a>.</li><li><strong>Bipolar disorder</strong> — suggested by major depression that is accompanied by, or interspersed with mania, hypomania, or mixed episodes. For further information, please see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/bipolar-disorder/\">Bipolar disorder</a>.</li><li><strong>Eating disorders</strong> — suggested by persistent disturbance of eating or eating-related behaviour that leads to altered intake or absorption of food and causes significant impairment to health and psychosocial functioning. For further information, please see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/eating-disorders/\">Eating disorders</a>.</li><li><strong>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</strong> — suggested by anxiety caused by exposure to reminders of past trauma. The person may report feeling as if they are reliving these events through flashbacks, nightmares etc. For further information, please see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/\">Post-traumatic stress disorder</a>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Also be aware of the clinical features of:</strong><ul><li><strong>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)</strong> that in some cases may remain undiagnosed and can be associated with mental health problems. Features can include difficulties in social interaction and communication, and rigid and repetitive behaviours, but in some people may be subtle, and particularly in females, may be masked. For further information, please see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/autism-in-adults/\">Autism in adults</a>.</li><li><strong>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</strong> — suggested by inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms that started in childhood. May be associated with elevated stress, burnout, anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and especially in females may be mistaken for, or diagnostically overshadowed by, anxiety.</li></ul></li><li><strong>If appropriate (depending on clinical features), assess the person's risk of suicide.

with a suspected mental health problem is largely based on expert opinion in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines <em>Generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder in adults: Management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/mental-health-in-students/references/\">NICE, 2011b</a>] and<em> Depression: the treatment and management of depression in adults </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/mental-health-in-students/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2019</a>], as well as being pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</p><ul><li>While these NICE guidelines provide recommendations relating to the diagnosis of specific mental health issues, CKS pragmatically recommends that the general principles of assessment can be extrapolated to apply to the wider diagnosis of other mental health problems.</li><li>An expert reviewer advised that 'poor sleep is often seen alongside mental health problems in students and maybe partly causal for many' and recommended enquiring about sleep patterns when assessing a student with a mental health problem. This reviewer also opined that addiction is a relatively common mental health problem seen in students. CKS therefore recommends considering addiction as a potential diagnosis when a student presents with a mental health problem.</li><li>For further detailed information on assessing for the presence of specific mental health problems and associated issues, as well as the detailed basis for the recommendations made in this topic, please see the CKS topics on  <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/alcohol-problem-drinking/\">Alcohol — problem drinking</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/bipolar-disorder/\">Bipolar disorder</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression/\">Depression</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/eating-disorders/\">Eating disorders</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/generalized-anxiety-disorder/\">Generalized anxiety disorder</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/\">Opioid dependence</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/\">Post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, and <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/psychosis-schizophrenia/\">Psychosis and schizophrenia</a>.</li></ul><!-- end field 922b0e4e-3fc7-483d-9604-ac4f01122c15 --><!-- end item 9b6a3863-e8fd-4d16-bcc2-4547e0f28ed0 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
