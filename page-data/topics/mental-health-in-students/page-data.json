significant numbers of higher education students could consider identifying young people at risk of mental health problems by routinely:<ul><li>Assessing mental wellbeing when students join the practice (using short questionnaires).</li><li>Reviewing the history of students with a pre-existing mental health diagnosis. </li><li>Asking students about their current mental wellbeing opportunistically. </li></ul></li><li>Where a mental health problem is suspected, the student should be assessed to determine the diagnosis and the severity of the condition.</li><li>The risk of

caring for students with mental health problems should be aware of the importance of communicating and co-ordinating with healthcare professionals involved in the person's care at their home location, other personnel involved in their care at the university site (including university counsellors and members of multidisciplinary teams) and, if the student has provided consent and this is deemed appropriate, their parents/carers.</li></ul><!-- end field b805883f-0258-468d-85ca-ac1e00a385f7 --><!-- end item e58a952a-c6db-49c1-b0c4-ac1e00a385f7
