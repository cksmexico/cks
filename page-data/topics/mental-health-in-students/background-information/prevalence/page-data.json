However, this is lower than prevalence figures obtained from anonymous surveys and <strong>is likely to be an underestimate of the true prevalence, </strong>due to:</strong><ul><li>The perceived stigma associated with officially declaring a mental health condition.</li><li>The fact that mental health problems must be declared when applying to university in the ‘disability/special needs’ section of the UCAS form. Some young people with mental health problems may not view themselves as having a disability, do not have a formally diagnosed condition, or do not see their difficulties as long term.</li></ul></li><li><strong style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;\">In a 2019 survey of 21,000 students from over 140 universities in the UK:</strong><ul><li><strong>42.3% stated that they had had a serious personal, emotional, behavioural, or mental health problem for which they needed professional help.</strong><ul><li>Students among this cohort were statistically significantly more likely to identify as non-binary gender, and/or be in the third year of university, aged between 19 and 20 years, from the UK, and ethnically white.

However, the prevalence of respondents with ‘Black’, ‘Mixed’, and ‘Other’ ethnicities was broadly consistent with the higher education population in general.</li></ul></li><li>In some demographic groups (such as males and people from particular cultural backgrounds), recognition and/or candid expression of mental health problems may be less likely. </li><li>International students participating in this type of research must have a good command of English, and be particularly motivated by the topic of mental health, and therefore may not be representative of the whole international community. </li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/mental-health-in-students/references/\">Institute for Employment Studies and REAP, 2015</a>;
