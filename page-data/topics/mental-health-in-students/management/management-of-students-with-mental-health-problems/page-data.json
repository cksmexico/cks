CKS has therefore included pragmatic advice for GPs who may encounter this or a similar scenario.</li></ul><h5>Safety plan</h5><ul><li>The advice to consider formulating a safety plan is based on the opinion of an expert reviewer of this topic, who stated that 'there is some good evidence that building a safety plan can reduce the incidence of suicide'.</li></ul><h5>Gaining consent to communicate with parents </h5><ul><li>The recommendation to gain and document prospective consent to notify parents if there are concerns about a student's mental health is largely pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice. There is evidence that this approach is often welcomed by students [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/mental-health-in-students/references/\">Hubble, 2020</a>]:<ul><li>A 2019 survey asked students if they would be happy for their parents to be contacted in the event of concerns about their mental health. 66% were happy for their parents to be contacted in the event of extreme circumstances, with a further 15% happy in any circumstances and only 18% not happy for their parents to be contacted at all.</li><li>A scheme at one UK university inviting students to opt-in to allowing parents or trusted adults to be contacted in the event of concerns about mental health has an uptake of 95%.</li></ul></li><li>However, an expert reviewer of this topic noted that in some cases, families can be the cause of mental health problems in students, and urged caution. CKS therefore recommends gaining and documenting prospective consent from students with mental health problems to ensure that families are only contacted if appropriate. Where there is doubt, or if a student who has not provided prospective consent for family contact presents with an acute mental health crisis, clinicians should consult the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/271792/Consensus_statement_on_information_sharing.pdf\" data-hyperlink-id=\"33314eff-544a-474e-94cd-ac6e0116bda9\">National Consensus Statement on Information Sharing and Suicide Prevention</a>.</li></ul><!-- end field 3ce37113-34e1-4864-abd1-ac1e00a385f8 --><!-- end item 00402da9-daa0-4137-9440-ac1e00a385f8 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
