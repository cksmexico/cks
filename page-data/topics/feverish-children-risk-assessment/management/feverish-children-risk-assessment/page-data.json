A delayed or missed diagnosis of serious bacterial infection may be life-threatening or cause significant morbidity. Viral and bacterial infections may also co-exist or evolve over time [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/feverish-children-risk-assessment/references/\">Craig, 2010</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/feverish-children-risk-assessment/references/\">Mace, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/feverish-children-risk-assessment/references/\">Rosenfeld-Yehoshua, 2018</a>].<ul><li>The younger the child, the more difficult it may be to clinically establish a diagnosis and assess the severity of illness [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/feverish-children-risk-assessment/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li><li>Improved recognition, evaluation, and treatment of febrile illness in children may lead to a reduction in mortality from infectious disease. In addition, appropriate risk assessment of children with minor self-limiting illnesses means they do not undergo unnecessary investigations and treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/feverish-children-risk-assessment/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation to use the NICE 'traffic light' system to assess and predict a child's risk of serious illness and the need for further investigation and/or monitoring is based on evidence-based reviews identified by NICE, clinical features in the Yale Observation Scale (a pre-existing scoring system), and the clinical experience of the NICE guideline development group [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/feverish-children-risk-assessment/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].<ul><li>NICE assessed multiple heterogeneous studies of variable quality which used different methodologies, temperature cut-offs for study inclusion, study populations, clinical settings, and outcomes. As a result, the data could not be pooled, and it was difficult for the guideline development group to compare evidence from multiple studies for a particular symptom or sign.<ul><li>It identified two scoring systems, the Yale Observational Scale and the Young Infant Observation Score, however neither scale was considered sensitive for the detection of serious bacterial infection. It concluded that the Yale Observation Scale was good at excluding serious illness but was less good at identifying serious illness, and was most useful when combined with a clinical history and examination. Most of the data were in infants younger than 6 months of age, and this data was extrapolated to older children by NICE.</li></ul></li><li>NICE conducted an initial systematic review of the relationship between the height of fever and the risk of serious illness, and found the predictive value of a high temperature was poor in general, however a higher predictive value was noted in childer under the age of 6 months.</li></ul></li><li>A subsequent systematic review of 11 cohort and case control studies of high fever as a predictor for serious bacterial infection found that infants under 3 months of age with a fever greater than 40°C were at increased risk of serious bacterial infection compared with older children. The pooled data for serious bacterial infection in children over 3 months of age with a fever greater than 40°C compared with children with lower temperature did not find a statistically significant risk difference. The authors noted methodological limitations of a small number of studies and significant heterogeneity of the included studies [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/feverish-children-risk-assessment/references/\">Rosenfeld-Yehoshua, 2018</a>].</li><li>An Australian 2-year prospective cohort study of children under 5 years presenting with a febrile illness (n = 15,781 febrile episodes) analyzed data in order to develop a multi-variable model to distinguish serious bacterial infections from self-limiting non-bacterial illness [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/feverish-children-risk-assessment/references/\">Craig, 2010</a>].<ul><li>It found that emergency department clinicians tend to underestimate the likelihood of serious bacterial infection in young febrile children, leading to undertreatment with antibiotics.</li></ul></li><li>CKS found two studies which have assessed the validity of the NICE traffic light system in different clinical settings.<ul><li>An Australian retrospective analysis of the same study data found the NICE traffic light system had a test sensitivity of 85.5% and specificity of 28.5% for the detection of any serious bacterial infection (specifically urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and bacteraemia). In particular, it failed to detect 13.8% of serious infections (children classified in the green zone), particularly urinary tract infections. It found that adding urine analysis to the scoring system significantly improved the traffic light system test performance and sensitivity [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/feverish-children-risk-assessment/references/\">De, 2013</a>]. CKS notes that NICE recommend considering urine analysis on all children with fever with no apparent focus of infection.</li><li>A European study of the predictive value of the red features of the NICE traffic light system in identifying serious infection in children presenting with acute illness in various settings in primary care, emergency and paediatric departments (n = 6,260), found that the presence of three or more red features improved the predictive value of serious infection, however the results were not consistent in multiple settings [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/feverish-children-risk-assessment/references/\">Kerkhof, 2014</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Management of an infant or child with red features</h5><ul><li>The NICE clinical guideline on feverish illness notes that fever may be the presenting feature of serious bacterial infections such as bacterial meningitis, sepsis, or pneumonia. The clinical features of focal neurological signs, focal seizures, and/or decreased level of consciousness may indicate a diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis.</li><li>The recommendation to assess a child urgently within 2 hours if there are no life-threatening features is based on a NICE guideline development group Delphi consensus which was used to define a specific timeframe for further assessment. NICE notes that the majority of infants and children with one or more red features will be referred for hospital assessment due to the high risk of serious illness.<ul><li>Young children with serious illness may deteriorate within hours of onset, and a period of hospital observation may help to identify and monitor these children in a safe environment.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Management of an infant or child with amber or green features</h5><ul><li>The NICE clinical guideline on feverish illness notes that the majority of febrile illness in children is due to self-limiting viral infections. Children with fever without an apparent source of infection may be a cause for concern, however, as it can be difficult to distinguish between a simple viral infection and life-threatening bacterial infection in this group. A period of observation in hospital may be helpful to differentiate non-serious from serious illness.</li><li>The recommendation to arrange admission for any infant under 3 months of age with a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI) is based on the NICE clinical guideline on UTI in children.</li><li>The clinical feature of fever lasting more than 5 days is significant as this may indicate a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease if associated with other typical symptoms and signs [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/feverish-children-risk-assessment/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li><li>The clinical features of swelling of a joint or limb and/or non-weight bearing or non-use of a limb are significant as these may indicate bone or joint infection such as septic arthritis or osteomyelitis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/feverish-children-risk-assessment/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to safety net and/or reassess the child is based on the need to check for any clinical deterioration and to assess for new symptoms or signs suggesting an underlying cause for fever [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/feverish-children-risk-assessment/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li></ul><h5>Management of a child at home</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to assess for an underlying cause of fever is based on the NICE clinical guideline on feverish illness.<ul><li>The recommendation to consider urine analysis to exclude a UTI is based on the fact that this is a common source of fever and may present with non-specific or no additional symptoms in young infants and children [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/feverish-children-risk-assessment/references/\">Ishimine, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/feverish-children-risk-assessment/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>]. In addition, the US emergency medicine policy document includes fever duration of greater than 24 hours and no obvious source of infection as clinical risk factors for UTI in well-appearing infants and children aged 2 months to 2 years [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/feverish-children-risk-assessment/references/\">Mace, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The recommendations on the use of antipyretic drugs are based on the NICE clinical guideline on feverish illness, a Cochrane systematic review [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/feverish-children-risk-assessment/references/\">Offringa, 2017</a>], an ILAE Task Force Report [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/feverish-children-risk-assessment/references/\">Wilmshurst, 2015</a>], and expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/feverish-children-risk-assessment/references/\">Richardson, 2015</a>].<ul><li>The recommendation not to use prophylactic antipyretic drugs to prevent febrile seizures is based on a Cochrane systematic review of 30 randomized trials (n = 4256) which studied the continuous or intermittent use of prophylactic antipyretic, antiepileptic, or other drugs compared with each other, placebo, or no treatment.
