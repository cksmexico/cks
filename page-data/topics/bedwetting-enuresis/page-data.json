This is thought to be caused by sleep arousal difficulties, polyuria, and/or bladder dysfunction.</li><li>Primary bedwetting <em>with </em>daytime symptoms — the child or young person has never achieved sustained continence at night and has daytime symptoms, such as wetting, urinary frequency, or urgency. This may be caused by an overactive bladder, congenital malformations, neurological disorders, urinary tract infection (UTI), or chronic constipation.</li><li>Secondary bedwetting — bedwetting occurs after the child or young person has been previously dry at night for more than 6 months. This is usually due to an underlying cause, such as diabetes, UTI, constipation, psychological problems (for example behavioural or emotional problems), or family problems (vulnerable child or family).</li></ul></li><li>Risk factors associated with bedwetting include:<ul><li>A family history of bedwetting.</li><li>Male gender (there is a 2:1 male to female ratio).</li><li>Delay in attaining bladder control.</li><li>Obesity.</li><li>Psychological or behavioural disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, and anxiety, depressive, and conduct disorders.</li></ul></li><li>When assessing a child or young person with bedwetting, it is necessary to determine the type of bedwetting by asking if:<ul><li>There are any daytime symptoms.</li><li>The child has previously been dry at night without assistance for 6 months.</li></ul></li><li>Managing primary bedwetting without daytime symptoms involves:<ul><li>Giving appropriate information and advice, including general advice on bedwetting, advice on lifting and waking, and advice on fluid intake, diet, toileting patterns, and positive reward systems.</li><li>In children younger than 5 years of age, giving reassurance that many children of that age wet the bed and that this usually resolves without treatment. </li><li>In those aged 5 years of age and older, if bedwetting is infrequent (less than twice a week), giving reassurance that bedwetting may resolve without treatment and offering the option of a wait-and-see approach. If treatment is required, options include an enuresis alarm in combination with positive reward systems (first-line treatment) and treatment with desmopressin.</li><li>Arranging specialist review for children and young people whose bedwetting has not responded to courses of initial treatments.</li></ul></li><li>Managing primary bedwetting with daytime symptoms involves:<ul><li>Referring the child or young person to secondary care or an enuresis clinic for further investigations and assessment.</li><li>Considering further assessment and investigation to exclude a specific medical problem for children over 2 years who, despite awareness of toileting needs and showing appropriate toileting behaviour, are struggling to not wet themselves during the day as well as the night.</li></ul></li><li>Managing secondary bedwetting involves managing the underlying cause in primary care where possible, or arranging referral to a paediatrician or an enuresis clinic if an underlying cause cannot be managed in primary care or is not clearly identified.</li></ul><!-- end field 9d34954e-65b4-437f-a111-b6a9802ae230 --><!-- end item 6fcfeced-f6c8-4a74-a1aa-69413fef4868 -->","topic":{"id":"494d35c8-2f43-5deb-bf3b-a6b8fe526ea5","topicId":"ce6704cc-49b8-49dd-8017-46b17a9f54dc","topicName":"Bedwetting (enuresis)","slug":"bedwetting-enuresis","aliases":["Enuresis -
