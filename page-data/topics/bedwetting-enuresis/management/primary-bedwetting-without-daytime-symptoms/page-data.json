This trial suggested that it is not just the interaction with the child that causes dryness, but the focus on bedwetting behaviours that leads to success.</li><li>Three trials found that dry bed training with an enuresis alarm, cognitive behaviour therapy, enuresis alarm, and stop-start training gave fewer wet nights; however, there was no difference for 14 dry nights and drop-out rates.</li></ul></li><li>The NICE GDG states that reward systems are easier to implement than other treatments (such as dry bed training with an enuresis alarm, cognitive behavioural therapy, enuresis alarm, and stop-start training).</li><li>The recommendation to use reward systems alone in children who are able to achieve some dry nights is based on the expert opinion of the NICE GDG.</li></ul><h5>Treatments</h5><ul><li>Enuresis alarm and desmopressin.<ul><li>See the sections on <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bedwetting-enuresis/management/primary-bedwetting-without-daytime-symptoms/#enuresis-alarms\">Enuresis alarms</a> and <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bedwetting-enuresis/management/primary-bedwetting-without-daytime-symptoms/#desmopressin\">Desmopressin</a> for more information.</li></ul></li><li>Wait-and-see approach.<ul><li>CKS recommends considering a wait-and-see approach for older children with infrequent bedwetting as this is more likely to resolve without treatment than frequent bedwetting.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Sources of support</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the expert opinion of the NICE GDG.</li></ul><h5>Referral</h5><ul><li>NICE recommends that children with primary bedwetting without daytime symptoms should be referred if symptoms have not responded to courses of treatment with an alarm and/or desmopressin. This is because these children may require further assessment of factors that may be associated with a poor response, such as an overactive bladder, an underlying disease, or social and emotional factors. However, they do not state how many courses may be tried before referral is considered.</li><li>Previous expert reviewers of this CKS topic felt that no more than two courses of treatment should be tried before referral because repeated failed attempts reduce the future success of treatment.</li><li>The NICE GDG stated that a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) or an antimuscarinic may be considered if the child has not responded to all other treatment and has been assessed by a healthcare professional with expertise in the management of bedwetting. The GDG were specifically concerned about the potential adverse effects of TCAs and their danger in overdose.</li></ul><h5>Treatments not recommended</h5><ul><li>Bladder training and retention control training are not recommended because:<ul><li>Only very poor-quality trials were identified for bladder training and retention control training, and the NICE GDG did not believe that the evidence for the interventions was sufficient to recommend their use ahead of other treatments.</li><li>Although there was no evidence of harms from these studies, the NICE GDG felt that interrupting voiding or encouraging infrequent urination may promote voiding dysfunction.</li></ul></li><li>Dry bed training is not recommended because there is very poor-quality evidence to support its use. In addition, the GDG felt that some components of dry bed training were unacceptably punitive, inappropriate, and potentially psychologically damaging. The punitive elements were identified as repetitive (20 times) positive practice, being told they were wet and informing visitors to the house they were trying to become dry, sleep loss even when dry (being woken to check if they were dry), and reprimanding.</li></ul><!-- end field 33fa674d-de4e-4bf1-9dc4-5c139d58a9d6 --><!-- end item ded92e5c-9bf1-4bea-a56c-004b8fdd281f -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"5630ad3f-53f6-5a16-bfcd-791cb4c4bc18","slug":"enuresis-alarms","fullItemName":"Enuresis alarms","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 9f8fb113-11d6-456d-9011-6ff62f022556 --><h3>Enuresis alarms</h3><!-- end field 9f8fb113-11d6-456d-9011-6ff62f022556 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 5fa580e8-5c08-4439-b82e-f9e4d8a9d661 --><!-- begin field 59c7c1b8-923f-45dc-abdf-407a789dce8b --><ul><li><strong>Enuresis alarms are generally considered as a first-line treatment for bedwetting unless:</strong><ul><li>The child or young person or their parents/carers do not want to use one.</li><li>The child or young person wets the bed (infrequently) less than once or twice a week.</li><li>Parents/carers have emotional difficulty coping with the burden of bedwetting.</li><li>Parents/carers express anger, negativity, or blame towards the child.</li><li>The child or young person is younger than 7 years of age and is not able to use an alarm.<ul><li>The decision to use an alarm in a child younger than 7 years of age is based on the child's maturity, their understanding of the alarm, and their motivation.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Provide detailed information on enuresis alarms to the child or young person</strong><strong> and their parents/carers. </strong><ul><li>This should include information on the aims of alarm treatment, how the enuresis alarm works, and how to obtain an enuresis alarm (enuresis alarms cannot be prescribed on the NHS).</li><li>Advise that enuresis alarms have a high long-term success rate, but they may not suit all families.

They considered that this idea of monitoring children on desmopressin may have arisen because of the other clinical conditions for which desmopressin may be used.</li></ul><!-- end field 365a6f43-3ecc-493d-8255-ab8500bba6df --><!-- end item d974a480-d075-47aa-bcf4-ab8500bba694 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"f4259758-34e8-52d2-bc6d-2ac0c1714c72","slug":"managing-recurrence","fullItemName":"Managing recurrence","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 9048ad48-3ceb-4bd4-8eb0-2e4e903e6229 --><h3>How should I manage children and young people who have been successfully treated and start to wet the bed again?</h3><!-- end field 9048ad48-3ceb-4bd4-8eb0-2e4e903e6229 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item ec60d786-116d-4902-b872-d466fadd5039 --><!-- begin field 9e464560-a942-4b77-aaef-a6373b6fbb93 --><ul><li><strong>For children and young people who have been treated successfully with an <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bedwetting-enuresis/management/primary-bedwetting-without-daytime-symptoms/#enuresis-alarms\">enuresis alarm</a> and start wetting the bed again:</strong><ul><li>Restart alarm treatment, <em>or</em></li><li>If there is more than one recurrence of bedwetting, offer combination treatment with an alarm and <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bedwetting-enuresis/management/primary-bedwetting-without-daytime-symptoms/#desmopressin\">desmopressin</a>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>For children and young people who have respond well to desmopressin but experience recurrence when treatment is withdrawn, consider:</strong><ul><li>Prescribing another course of desmopressin (repeated courses may be used).<ul><li>Withdraw desmopressin treatment at regular intervals (for 1 week every 3 months) to check whether dryness has been achieved.</li></ul></li><li>Gradually withdrawing desmopressin rather than stopping it suddenly.<ul><li>A suitable withdrawal regimen used in clinical trials was an increase of 'no-medication days' over an 8-week period.</li></ul></li><li>Using an enuresis alarm instead of restarting desmopressin, if an alarm is now considered appropriate and the child or young person and/or their parents/carers want to try one.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 9e464560-a942-4b77-aaef-a6373b6fbb93 --><!-- end item ec60d786-116d-4902-b872-d466fadd5039 -->","subChapters":[{"id":"03c1cec4-bf6c-52e4-a6fc-003fb57c797a","slug":"basis-for-recommendation-1ba","fullItemName":"Basis for recommendation","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 3750a8c1-29fa-4e94-93f3-2bbc213a579e --><h4>Basis for recommendation</h4><!-- end field 3750a8c1-29fa-4e94-93f3-2bbc213a579e -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 1ba2b754-3b1c-4011-9750-0326ef06a79b --><!-- begin field fcda5429-fafe-4b22-897b-f4c3817d5aa0 --><p>These recommendations are based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline <em>Nocturnal enuresis: the management of bedwetting in children and young people </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bedwetting-enuresis/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2010</a>]. The <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg111/resources/2018-surveillance-of-bedwetting-in-under-19s-nice-guideline-cg111-6599305837/chapter/Overview-of-2018-surveillance-methods?tab=evidence\" data-hyperlink-id=\"9ba1172e-d33d-4848-9766-ab8500cf164b\">2018 NICE surveillance review</a> did not find sufficient new evidence to warrant an update of the guideline. </p><h5>Managing recurrences</h5><ul><li>These recommendations are based on expert opinion of the NICE guideline development group (GDG).
