Most of these studies were small cohort studies or case series in children in secondary or tertiary referral centres. The GDG considered the evidence identified to be of poor quality and were unable to use it to guide decision-making.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Assessing for underlying causes</h4><ul><li>Primary bedwetting with daytime symptoms is usually caused by disorders of the lower urinary tract, such as an overactive bladder, but may also be caused by congenital malformations or neurological disorders [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bedwetting-enuresis/references/\">Caldwell, 2013</a>]. It is occasionally caused by chronic constipation or urinary tract infection. The recommendation to examine the child's back for signs of congenital spinal malformations, such as dimples or hairy patch, is based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bedwetting-enuresis/references/\">Kiddoo, 2012</a>].</li><li>Secondary bedwetting may have an underlying cause, such as diabetes, urinary tract infection, constipation, psychological problems (for example behavioural or emotional problems), or family problems (vulnerable child or family). NICE states that although most children with bedwetting will not have an underlying systemic illness, it is important that these are considered especially if bedwetting has started recently.</li></ul><h4>Keeping a diary</h4><ul><li>NICE recommends considering keeping a diary of symptoms because in order to make a good assessment, healthcare professionals need to understand the symptoms experienced by the child, and the child's drinking and toileting behaviour. It is thought that:<ul><li>Parents or carers are often not aware of their child or young person’s drinking and toileting behaviour when the child or young person spends a lot of their time outside the home. A diary may help the child and family recognize the problem and monitor progress.</li><li>When the child is managed in pull ups or nappies, it can sometimes be useful to weigh these to inform an understanding of how much urine the child is passing at night, compared with how much they pass when urinating during the day.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation to keep a diary for 2 weeks is based on expert consensus opinion from the NICE GDG.</li></ul><h4>When to consider child maltreatment</h4><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the NICE guideline on bedwetting<em> </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bedwetting-enuresis/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2010</a>] and the NICE guideline <em>Child maltreatment: when to suspect maltreatment in under 18s</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bedwetting-enuresis/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li></ul><h4>Urinalysis</h4><ul><li>These recommendations are based on the expert opinion of the NICE GDG.</li><li>The NICE GDG found no evidence to support the routine use of urinalysis in children with bedwetting and stated that this was not necessarily worthwhile.</li></ul><h4>Including the child or young person in the assessment</h4><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the expert opinion of the NICE GDG. The GDG state that it was important to consider the views of the child or young person (as well as the family) in order to understand the expectations of the child or young person and their family/carers.</li></ul><!-- end field ca385b23-5b80-4cef-a515-ab840133a902 --><!-- end item 264a1b00-130b-47c9-b571-ab840133a895 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
