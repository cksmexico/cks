A systematic review found 16 RCTs of ginger as an intervention for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, but was unable to pool data because of the heterogeneity between studies in terms of population, intervention, comparators and outcomes. After looking at individual studies, the authors concluded that the overall quality of evidence was low, and was more applicable to women with less severe symptoms of nausea and vomiting. Results were promising and indicated that ginger may be better than placebo with regard to symptom reduction, but due to the methodological flaws of the included studies, this was not conclusive and larger, better quality trials are needed [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/references/\">O&#39;Donnell et al, 2016</a>].<ul><li>This is consistent with the findings of other systematic reviews [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/references/\">Festin, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/references/\">Thomson et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/references/\">Viljoen et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/references/\">Matthews et al, 2015</a>]. </li></ul></li><li>The UK Teratology Information Service (UKTIS) reviewed the safety data for ginger<strong> </strong>and identified two cohort studies and a number of small clinical trials including a small number of women. These found no evidence of an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes including congenital malformations associated with ginger when taken during pregnancy, although a higher risk of fetal adverse effects cannot be entirely ruled out because of the limited data available [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/references/\">UKTIS, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h5>P6 (wrist) acupressure</h5><ul><li>P6 (wrist) acupressure is included as an option to treat nausea and vomiting in pregnancy by the NICE guideline <em>Antenatal care for uncomplicated pregnancies </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/references/\">NICE, 2008</a>]. In the guideline <em>The management of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum,</em> the RCOG states that acupressure may improve the symptoms of nausea and vomiting and is safe in pregnancy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/references/\">RCOG, 2016</a>]. </li><li>Evidence for P6 (wrist) acupressure is limited [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/references/\">Matthews et al, 2015</a>]. A systematic review found eight RCTs of acupressure compared with placebo or sham treatment for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy of which seven used the P6 (wrist) acupressure point. The evidence available varied in quality, which limited the conclusions which could be drawn as it was not possible to pool data in a meta-analysis due to variability between populations, interventions, outcomes, and settings. Acupressure may have a beneficial effect if nausea and vomiting symptoms are mild, but larger and better quality studies are required [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/references/\">O&#39;Donnell et al, 2016</a>].<ul><li>Other systematic reviews had similar findings [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/references/\">Festin, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/references/\">Matthews et al, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/references/\">Van den Heuvel et al, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li><li>In terms of safety, there are no theoretical concerns about the use of acupressure in pregnancy, but a UKTIS review of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy found no formal data for this intervention [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/references/\">UKTIS, 2015a</a>].</li></ul><h5>Avoidance of iron-containing preparations</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on RCOG and SOGC guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/references/\">RCOG, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/references/\">SOGC, 2016</a>], and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/references/\">Clark et al, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/references/\">Tan et al, 2016</a>].</li><li>The SOGC considers that, unless the woman is iron deficient, there may not be an indication for routine iron supplementation in the first trimester (for example iron-containing prenatal vitamins) because there is no increase in iron requirements at this time.

There is a large amount of data available from a meta-analysis and a large prospective series on the safety of antihistamines in pregnancy. This does not indicate an increased rate of major congenital malformations for antihistamines in general (although data are limited to one small observational study for cyclizine) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/references/\">UKTIS, 2015b</a>].
