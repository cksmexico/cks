It can affect people of any age.<ul><li>The ICD-10 describes a major traumatic event as 'a stressful event or situation of an exceptionally threatening or catastrophic nature, which is likely to cause pervasive distress in almost anyone'.</li><li>The DSM-5 describes a major traumatic event as 'exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence'.</li></ul></li><li>The onset of symptoms is usually in the first month after the traumatic event. However, in a minority of people, symptoms can be delayed by months or years.</li><li>In adults:<ul><li>In around two-thirds of people, symptoms resolve naturally, although this may take several months.</li><li>For around a third of people, symptoms are longer lasting, and for many, these are severe and enduring.</li></ul></li><li>Complex post-traumatic stress disorder may develop after extreme prolonged or repeated trauma (such as repeated childhood sexual abuse or prolonged captivity involving torture).</li><li>Post-traumatic stress disorder should be suspected if the person has experienced a traumatic event and presents with any of the following:<ul><li>Re-experiencing symptoms — which may occur in the daytime when the person is awake (flashbacks, or intrusive images or thoughts) or as nightmares when asleep. This is the most characteristic symptom.</li><li>Avoidance of people or places that remind the person of the event.</li><li>Emotional numbing/negative thoughts, where the person expresses a lack of ability to experience feelings or feels detached from other people, or has negative thoughts about themselves.</li><li>Hyperarousal/hyperreactivity, where the person is on guard all the time, looking for danger (hypervigilance), or the person has irritable behaviour or angry outbursts with little or no provocation.</li></ul></li><li>For all people with sub-clinical PTSD symptoms, consider a period of watchful waiting and arrange regular review.</li><li>For adults with clinically important PTSD symptoms of any duration, offer referral to a specialist mental health service for trauma-based psychological therapies and/or drug treatment. The need for emergency medical or psychiatric referral should be assessed by looking for the presence and severity of secondary psychological disorders.</li><li>For children and young people aged 18 years and under with clinically important PTSD symptoms:<ul><li>If the symptoms have persisted for more than one month, offer referral to a specialist mental health service.</li><li>If the trauma occurred within the last month, use clinical judgement to determine whether watchful waiting or specialist referral are appropriate.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 207bad3c-ce75-492e-a7f5-6f9364e14bca --><!-- end item a03db1b8-f4dd-46a1-8ec1-72a55c8dd25e -->","topic":{"id":"533afaeb-861a-55f6-ae85-a0876ad3c4ab","topicId":"4676b2a0-1d7e-49c9-a79f-d2d558307370","topicName":"Post-traumatic stress disorder","slug":"post-traumatic-stress-disorder","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"6114e299-9845-5fc0-92b9-5c972e9c90f1","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"52893b93-e424-59ff-84a1-7dd9d9c8621a","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"4be53e3f-4d5e-556c-a6ed-aeebfd10913f","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"5d1733e3-23d7-5fe8-b3cd-8444b4097187","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"3b6b3dc7-0b46-5df1-a1c8-9e7d1cfc1bf5","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"924b02ab-fe04-5ca6-bfe4-efb3fa6b1e5c","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"ddf247aa-bfb1-5234-9e83-9df355d28fbb","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"afdc351f-4815-5456-9d22-1e17d70923b9","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"fa4ae569-9575-57de-8a77-f97e6acf134e","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"441dbc06-ae69-5d87-b878-08acf874b06d","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"380572c6-6c66-5ecd-bb4a-907f070efec7","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP - Options for local implementation"},{"id":"6e104865-1bd8-5bbc-a881-5acad7b59200","slug":"nice-quality-standards","fullItemName":"NICE quality standards"}]},{"id":"f7a4b151-95d9-5da2-8bbb-3515fae24bcc","slug":"background-information","fullItemName":"Background information","subChapters":[{"id":"e8e51f81-8392-5390-8f30-d6a8e5f38014","slug":"definition","fullItemName":"Definition"},{"id":"0826975d-685e-520a-9295-f3528d50f411","slug":"risk-factors","fullItemName":"Risk factors"},{"id":"f35f4ff7-1d48-5dc1-acb1-c6b04aee33a8","slug":"prevalence","fullItemName":"Prevalence"},{"id":"3c03bd4a-5a08-5bb7-8f67-78a04deaff9a","slug":"prognosis","fullItemName":"Prognosis"},{"id":"406fb31f-fa1e-5214-b69e-e347e6875458","slug":"complications","fullItemName":"Complications"}]},{"id":"331796fb-0b83-5add-8e42-d0b72a892df8","slug":"diagnosis","fullItemName":"Diagnosis","subChapters":[{"id":"2ee24530-3791-5949-93f2-a856c919f68d","slug":"diagnosis","fullItemName":"Diagnosis"}]},{"id":"fae5c916-6c3e-5d0f-8700-e051eb95a992","slug":"management","fullItemName":"Management","subChapters":[{"id":"3a0b4bd2-81cd-5c2c-bb02-7c2734e8ebed","slug":"management","fullItemName":"Scenario: Management"}]},{"id":"2022c3bf-f856-5c11-b2fa-f455afe14e13","slug":"prescribing-information","fullItemName":"Prescribing information","subChapters":[{"id":"8c49cc16-aec3-5fe6-98f3-6facc85e65a4","slug":"ssris","fullItemName":"SSRIs"},{"id":"21362ceb-fea6-5f5e-a2fe-3a66b96f23bb","slug":"venlafaxine","fullItemName":"Venlafaxine"}]},{"id":"ace3b310-05bb-5555-9074-19f51f5bcc46","slug":"supporting-evidence","fullItemName":"Supporting evidence","subChapters":[]},{"id":"94089c18-8f8a-5c71-b9fa-98bab016d27c","slug":"how-this-topic-was-developed","fullItemName":"How this topic was developed","subChapters":[{"id":"fb1c0b33-ff77-5312-9d64-544591ee5a16","slug":"search-strategy","fullItemName":"Search strategy"},{"id":"ab823271-5683-5fa8-9990-359b8361a067","slug":"stakeholder-engagement","fullItemName":"Stakeholder engagement"},{"id":"4977229b-c104-593f-9254-5b46fd4cef6b","slug":"evidence-exclusion-criteria","fullItemName":"Evidence exclusion criteria"},{"id":"aa78f3e8-f7e9-5ec9-98a7-ab3a2ded7822","slug":"organizational-behavioural-financial-barriers","fullItemName":"Organizational, behavioural and financial barriers"},{"id":"40d90bf9-fb45-51a8-8085-ff7f6501f6e7","slug":"declarations-of-interest","fullItemName":"Declarations of interest"}]},{"id":"ad5c3e2a-1074-579a-82d5-e2675befc03f","slug":"references","fullItemName":"References","subChapters":[]}]}},"topic":{"id":"533afaeb-861a-55f6-ae85-a0876ad3c4ab","topicId":"4676b2a0-1d7e-49c9-a79f-d2d558307370","topicName":"Post-traumatic stress disorder","slug":"post-traumatic-stress-disorder","aliases":[],"topicSummary":"Post-traumatic stress disorder can develop following a major traumatic event.
