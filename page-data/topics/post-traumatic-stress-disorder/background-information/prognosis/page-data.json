In general, in most people, these symptoms disappear as they come to terms with the events.</li><li>In up to one third of people (depending on the type and severity of trauma), the symptoms continue and can develop into PTSD.</li><li>A meta-analysis of studies relating to subject populations with PTSD exposed to trauma that was intentional (n=14 studies) or non-intentional (n=21 studies) found that:<ul><li>Following exposure to a non-intentional trauma, around 30% of people may be expected to develop PTSD symptoms within one month of the event. In around half of these cases, symptoms will spontaneously remit over the following year.</li><li>Following exposure to an intentional trauma, development of PTSD may be delayed, with around 12% of people exhibiting PTSD symptoms within one month of the event and 23% exhibiting symptoms after one year. </li></ul></li><li>For many people, PTSD can be severe and enduring. The National Comorbidity survey in the US found that the average duration of symptoms was 36 months in people receiving treatment and 64 months among those untreated. In more than one third of people, symptoms never fully remitted.</li><li>Among those with chronic PTSD, the severity of symptoms fluctuates over time, with periods of greater severity potentially reflecting sensitivity to co-occurring stressors.</li><li>People with PTSD may benefit from treatment even when the symptoms have been present for many years.</li></ul></li><li><strong>There are also very limited data on the specific prognosis of post-traumatic stress disorder in children:</strong><ul><li>One study, which followed children who survived a boat disaster (the sinking of the Jupiter), found that 17.5% still experienced post-traumatic stress disorder 5–7 years later.</li><li>A second study, which followed children who survived a landslide (at Aberfan, Wales), found that 29% of those traced and interviewed still had post-traumatic stress disorder 33 years later.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/references/\">Kessler et al, 1995</a>;
