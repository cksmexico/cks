For information on what action to take if admission is thought to be necessary but the person refuses, see the 'compulsory admission' section in the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression/\">Depression</a>.

NICE also states that this cohort of people 'are typically referred to in studies that have not used a clinical interview to arrive at a formal diagnosis of PTSD and instead have only used self-report measures of PTSD symptoms' [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li><li>On this basis, and in the absence of any explicit advice from NICE relating to general use of validated screening instruments in primary care, CKS recommends that the term 'clinically important symptoms' can also encompass symptoms that cause at least moderate functional impairment.</li><li>The information on the criteria for assessing PTSD symptoms as mild, moderate, or severe is based on expert opinion in the BMJ Best Practice guideline <em>Post-traumatic stress disorder</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2018</a>].</li><li>The advice that where symptoms are ‘moderate’, clinical judgement should be used to determine the need for intervention is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><h5>When to refer</h5><ul><li>NICE recommends active monitoring for all people with <em>subthreshold</em> symptoms of PTSD that have developed within 1 month of a traumatic event, with follow-up contact to take place within one month. While they do not provide explicit recommendations relating to people with subthreshold symptoms that have continued for more than one month after a traumatic event, NICE only recommends treatment for people with 'clinically important symptoms' [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>]. CKS therefore advises that active monitoring that includes regular follow-up should be considered for people with subclinical PTSD symptoms of any duration.</li><li>NICE recommends that specialist referral and active monitoring can both be considered as options for children and young people with clinically important PTSD symptoms within one month of trauma, and that this decision is best left to clinical judgement. This is based on the guideline committee’s findings that while there is a lack of evidence for individual trauma-focused CBT for children and young people within the first month of trauma, there is evidence for its efficacy in children following trauma over one month ago, and in adults within one month of trauma. It was also stated that there can be natural recovery in the early weeks, and it can be difficult to gauge a child or young person's readiness for intervention within one month of trauma [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].<ul><li>The recommendation to seek specialist advice where there is any doubt is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good medical practice.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Availability of specialist treatment</h5><ul><li>The advice that availability and arrangements for accessing trauma-focused psychological treatments may vary locally, and there may sometimes be a significant delay before treatment begins is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><h5>Drug treatment</h5><ul><li>NICE advises that an SSRI or venlafaxine could be considered if a person prefers drug treatment, but they should not be offered as first-line treatment for PTSD. This is based on evidence that while SSRIs and venlafaxine are effective in treating PTSD (with better effects observed following venlafaxine treatment), SSRIs have been shown to be less clinically and cost effective than the recommended psychological interventions [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li><li>There was no evidence for significant differential efficacy of specific SSRIs (sertraline, fluoxetine and paroxetine), so the guideline committee agreed to allow prescribers to decide which SSRI to use. However, they included sertraline as an example because it is one of two drugs licensed in the UK for this indication and the other drug, paroxetine, is more likely to be associated with discontinuation symptoms [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li><li>The advice to consider offering drug treatment if referral is significantly delayed is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li><li>The limited available evidence on the use of drug treatments for PTSD in children and young people showed no significant benefits, so the NICE PTSD guideline committee agreed that drug treatment should not be offered [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li><li>The information on possible adverse effects of SSRIs and SNRIs, and monitoring for such effects is based on expert opinion in the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline <em>Generalised anxiety disorder and panic disorder in adults: management </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/references/\">NICE, 2011</a>].</li></ul><h5>Sleep disturbance</h5><ul><li>The recommendations for treating sleep disturbance are pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice, and are in-keeping with NICE's recommendation that the intitial assessment of a person with PTSD should be comprehensive, including an assessment of physical and psychological needs [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li><li>These recommendations are also consistent with those in the previous version of the NICE guideline on PTSD [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/references/\">NICE, 2005</a>].</li></ul><h5>Follow-up</h5><ul><li>The recommendations to follow-up for monitoring of the person's symptoms, functioning, and response to treatment at intervals determined by clinical judgement and as part of any shared care arrangement (if applicable) are largely pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice. The NICE PTSD guideline committee stated that it was important to review antidepressant treatment regularly to manage any side effects and to review clinical progress and outcomes, and also recommends follow-up for people with sub-clinical PTSD symptoms [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Sources of support</h5><ul><li>NICE recommends that people with post-traumatic stress disorder should receive details about peer support groups, which should ideally be facilitated by people with mental health training and supervision, be delivered in a way that reduces the risk of exacerbating symptoms, and provide information and help to access services [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>]. In the absence of any further guidance from NICE relating to specific support groups, the listed sources were either recommended by the Royal College of Psychiatrists [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/references/\">Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2015</a>], identified by CKS, or suggested by previous expert reviewers of this CKS topic. CKS has also chosen to include some selected internet support sites.</li></ul><!-- end field e255d950-d965-4fed-a5a0-0de4421a16a1 --><!-- end item 07979614-69c0-49ea-a544-b2c92c435f25 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
