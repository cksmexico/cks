Women described their experience of care and commented on what support they would have liked. Based on this descriptive data, the GDG recommended that all women should be offered a follow-up appointment, and made the following comments (which also reflected their own experience):<ul><li>They believed that offering the appointment would have a beneficial effect even for those women who chose not to accept it. For some women a follow-up appointment is valuable but others do not want or need an appointment.</li><li>Many women appreciate the opportunity to discuss possible reasons for the miscarriage and discuss planning for the future.</li><li>Only a minority of women would attend the follow-up appointment.</li><li>Some women might feel the need for a follow-up appointment at a later date.</li></ul></li><li>A Cochrane systematic review (search date December 2011) also concluded that women should be able to choose what support they wanted after a miscarriage [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/miscarriage/references/\">Murphy, 2012</a>].<ul><li>The review investigated whether follow up with counselling affects the psychological well-being of women following miscarriage and included six randomized controlled trials (n=1001 women).</li><li>All of the trials compared counselling with no counselling.</li><li>The evidence was insufficient to demonstrate the superiority of either no intervention or counselling.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h5>Cancelling further antenatal appointments</h5><ul><li>CKS recommends cancelling antenatal care arrangements to avoid unnecessary distress for the woman.</li></ul><h5>Trying for another baby</h5><ul><li>CKS identified a systematic review and meta-analysis (n = 1,043,840) that aimed to determine if a short interpregnancy interval (IPI, less than 6 months) following miscarriage is associated with adverse outcomes in the next pregnancy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/miscarriage/references/\">Kangatharan, 2017</a>].<ul><li>The results showed that an IPI of less than 6 months is associated with no increase in the risks of adverse outcomes in the pregnancy following miscarriage compared with delaying pregnancy for at least 6 months.<ul><li>With an IPI of less than 6 months, the overall risk of further miscarriage and preterm delivery were significantly reduced.</li><li>The pooled risks of stillbirth, low birthweight, and pre-eclampsia were not affected by IPI.</li><li>Similar findings were obtained in subgroup analyses when IPI of less than 6 months was compared with IPI of 6–12 months and more than12 months.</li></ul></li><li>The evidence suggests that delaying a pregnancy following a miscarriage is not beneficial and unless there are specific reasons for delay, couples should be advised to try for another pregnancy as soon as they feel ready.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Being aware of possible psychological distress</h5><ul><li>This information is based on evidence on the prevalence and severity of psychological distress following miscarriage [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/miscarriage/references/\">Brier, 1999</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/miscarriage/references/\">Brier, 2004</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/miscarriage/references/\">Brier, 2008</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article is that women should be screened frequently for depressive symptoms beginning at 6 weeks following a miscarriage and women experiencing clinically significant symptoms beyond 2 months after miscarriage should undergo formal mental health evaluation and treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/miscarriage/references/\">Nynas, 2015</a>].</li></ul><h5>Ensuring that anti-D immunoglobulin has been given where appropriate</h5><ul><li>The NICE GDG reviewed the evidence for anti-D rhesus prophylaxis for women with a miscarriage (or threatened miscarriage) in the first trimester<em> </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/miscarriage/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2012</a>].<ul><li>Although the quality of the evidence was very low, the NICE GDG felt that, taken as a whole, there was evidence of a risk of sensitization for women if they did not receive anti-D rhesus prophylaxis following a first trimester miscarriage. </li><li>The NICE GDG was informed that the chance of sensitization increases when there is a greater likelihood of mixing between the maternal and fetal blood, such as during surgical management of a miscarriage. For this reason, the GDG recommends that all rhesus-negative women who have had a surgical procedure to manage miscarriage should receive anti-D rhesus prophylaxis.</li><li>Based on their clinical experience, the NICE GDG considered the risk of significant fetal and maternal blood mixing during a spontaneous miscarriage or following treatment with misoprostol to be low and therefore does not recommend anti-D rhesus prophylaxis in these cases.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 4d7eb176-55dc-45ed-ad19-a786008b127b --><!-- end item 237aa276-51ea-41a2-8c90-a786008b127b -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
