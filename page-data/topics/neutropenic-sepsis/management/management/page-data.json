It recommends immediate referral of any person with suspected neutropenic sepsis for assessment in secondary or tertiary care, based on the experience and opinion of the NICE guideline development group [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">NICE, 2012</a>]. This approach is supported by expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Clarke, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Warnock, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">White, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Morgan, 2018</a>].</li><li>The NICE clinical guideline on sepsis notes that a delay in detecting and treating sepsis increases mortality rates. Prompt recognition and management of suspected sepsis can improve outcomes, as sepsis may progress rapidly to organ failure, septic shock, and death without appropriate management. Early management also reduces critical care admissions, inappropriate antimicrobial use, and length of hospital stay [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>].<ul><li>The key immediate interventions that increase survival are described in a SSC-derived care bundle which has been developed by the UK Sepsis Trust ('Sepsis Six'), which has been shown to significantly reduce mortality when applied within the first hour of recognition of suspected sepsis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Daniels, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Rhodes, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The German Society of Hematology and Medical Oncology guidelines note that there is no evidence that sepsis and septic shock in people with neutropenia should be managed differently to non-neutropenic people. They highlight that the timely recognition, diagnosis, and management of suspected sepsis is vital for the prognosis of critically ill people such as people with cancer who are neutropenic. They also note that recommendations for antimicrobial therapy are often based on studies which include non-neutropenic patients due to the lack of epidemiology data [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Kochanek, 2019</a>].<ul><li>This approach is supported by the ESMO clinical guidelines, which highlight the importance of prompt recognition of possible infection and sepsis in people with febrile neutropenia and initial management within one hour of the recognition of suspected sepsis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Klastersky, 2016</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article notes that people with neutropenic sepsis who appear clinically stable can deteriorate rapidly and require urgent specialist assessment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Morgan, 2018</a>], and this is supported by expert opinion in other review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Clarke, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Warnock, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation to follow local referral pathways if the person is clinically stable is based on the expert opinion of previous external reviewers of this CKS topic.</li><li>The recommendation to liaise with the person's specialist team if there is any uncertainty is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li><li>The recommendation to consider COVID-19 and applying the principles of assessment is based on<em> COVID-19 NICE rapid guideline: delivery of systemic anticancer treatments</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">NICE, 2020</a>]. </li><li>The recommendation to consider administering antibiotics in the absence of COVID-19 and in a pre-hospital setting if the person is critically unwell and transfer time to hospital is more than one hour is extrapolated from the NICE clinical guideline on sepsis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>].
