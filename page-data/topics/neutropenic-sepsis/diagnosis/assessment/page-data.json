suspected neutropenic sepsis are based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline <em>Sepsis: recognition, diagnosis and early management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>], the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) clinical practice guidelines <em>Management of febrile neutropaenia</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Klastersky, 2016</a>], the German Society of Hematology and Medical Oncology guidelines <em>Management of sepsis in neutropenic cancer patients: 2018 guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Working Party (AGIHO) and Intensive Care Working Party (iCHOP)</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Kochanek, 2019</a>], the UK Sepsis Trust <em>Sepsis Manual</em> [<a

href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">White, 2017</a>].</p><h4>Assessing clinical features on history-taking</h4><ul><li>The NICE clinical guideline on sepsis provides possible clinical features of sepsis, and notes that some people with sepsis are less likely to present with fever, including the elderly, frail, and immunosuppressed, for example, those undergoing anticancer treatment. This is supported by expert opinion in a review article, which notes that people who are immunosuppressed and/or have neutropenia often lack an obvious source of infection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Gauer, 2013</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to ask about the duration and intensity of chemotherapy or immunosuppressive drug regimen is based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">White, 2017</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to check whether the person is taking any antimicrobial prophylaxis (for example some people with cancer undergoing intensive chemotherapy) is extrapolated from the ESMO clinical guidelines. These note that prophylaxis for specific patient populations may be associated with an increased risk of antibiotic resistance. The German Society of Hematology and Medical Oncology guidelines highlight the importance of assessing for risk factors for antimicrobial resistance in people with neutropenia, as this impacts on specialist management options. In addition, prolonged recent administration of antibiotics may increase the risk of invasive fungal infection in people who are neutropenic.</li><li>The recommendation to ask whether the person is taking granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) prophylaxis is extrapolated from the ESMO clinical guidelines, which note this may be offered to people at high risk of febrile neutropenia during chemotherapy treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Klastersky, 2016</a>]. G-CSF stimulates the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells, thereby reducing the incidence and severity of neutropenia and neutropenic sepsis in some people [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Warnock, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">White, 2017</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to ask whether the person is taking corticosteroids is based on expert opinion in a review article, as corticosteroids may reduce the inflammatory response to infection such that a clear focus of infection may not be found [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Clarke, 2013</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to identify risk factors which help to stratify neutropenic patients regarding the risk of serious infection including invasive fungal infection is based on the ESMO clinical guidelines, the German Society of Hematology and Medical Oncology guidelines, and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Ku, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Warnock, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">White, 2017</a>].</li></ul><h4>Assessing clinical features on examination</h4><ul><li>The NICE clinical guideline on sepsis provides possible clinical features of sepsis, and notes that some people with sepsis are less likely to present with fever, including the elderly, frail, and immunosuppressed, for example, those undergoing anticancer treatment.</li><li>The information that viral exanthems in people who are immunosuppressed may present atypically is based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">White, 2017</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to check for signs of mucositis or other skin lesions is based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">White, 2017</a>].</li><li>The information that people with neutropenic sepsis often lack an obvious source of infection, and localizing signs of infection may be reduced or absent is based on expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Gauer, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Ku, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">White, 2017</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field a1dff8da-2b9c-423c-bfba-036d458440b9 --><!-- end item df860d14-f55b-4f75-8804-c723fbec7537 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
