An additional review article notes that people who are immunosuppressed and/or have neutropenia often lack an obvious source of infection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Gauer, 2013</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article notes that if a child undergoing anticancer treatment is unwell, sepsis should be considered early, even if they do not have a fever [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Morgan, 2018</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h4>When to suspect neutropenic sepsis</h4><ul><li>The recommendations on when to suspect neutropenic sepsis are based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">NICE, 2012</a>], the ESMO clinical guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Klastersky, 2016</a>], the German Society of Hematology and Medical Oncology guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Kochanek, 2019</a>], and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Clarke, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Warnock, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Morgan, 2018</a>].<ul><li>The information that sepsis can present with a wide variety of symptoms and signs is based on the experience and opinion of the NICE guideline development group. It did not find sufficient evidence to link specific symptoms and signs with the development of neutropenic sepsis. It acknowledged that urgent assessment of a person who is found not to subsequently have neutropenic sepsis could cause anxiety and unnecessary use of antibiotics, however, they considered the potential benefits of urgent assessment to outweigh the potential harms. The information on possible symptoms of infection is also based on expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Warnock, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Morgan, 2018</a>].</li><li>The NICE clinical guideline advises to suspect neutropenic sepsis in any person having anticancer treatment who becomes unwell, and notes their potential for rapid clinical deterioration, based on the experience and opinion of the guideline development group. It notes that neutropenic sepsis may present in people who are unwell with other symptoms, in the absence of fever. The ESMO clinical guidelines highlight the importance of vigilance in people at risk for neutropenic sepsis who are unwell, have a low-grade temperature or are afebrile, as they may be developing Gram-negative bacteraemia. The information that corticosteroids may mask an elevated temperature is based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Warnock, 2016</a>].</li><li>The NICE clinical guideline recommends suspecting neutropenic sepsis in a person at risk with a temperature greater than 38°C. It also notes that fever is a common sign of infection, but people may also present with hypothermia. This is supported by the German Society of Hematology and Medical Oncology guidelines, which note that sepsis may present with hypothermia. Furthermore, expert opinion in review articles notes that people with neutropenic sepsis may present with isolated pyrexia, a temperature in the normal range, or a low temperature [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Clarke, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Warnock, 2016</a>].</li><li>The NICE clinical guideline evidence review noted there was uncertainty about the signs and symptoms which predict neutropenic sepsis and its complications in people with cancer in the community, due to a lack of published evidence. Chills and altered mental status were associated with adverse outcome in two studies in secondary care, but the majority of people with neutropenic sepsis did not experience these symptoms. The German Society of Hematology and Medical Oncology guidelines also outline clinical parameters which may suggest sepsis in a person who is neutropenic, but note that neutropenia may cause changes in behaviour, mental state, or cognition independent from the onset of sepsis. The information that neutropenic sepsis may present with a general deterioration, or non-specific signs such as confusion is also based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neutropenic-sepsis/references/\">Clarke, 2013</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to follow local protocols to diagnose neutropenic sepsis if appropriate is based on the expert opinion of previous external reviewers of this CKS topic. It is also pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 299433e5-0216-41f2-92a4-feeb0f6b0ace --><!-- end item 3f41c405-fe1d-434e-9d46-8d52c2049037 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
