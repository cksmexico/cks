Additionally, for peri-orbital cellulitis, CT scanning of the face or orbits may be indicated to exclude orbital cellulitis and for orbital cellulitis to identify extension of disease, and exclude the potential of abscess formation. IV antibiotics may also be indicated [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/meibomian-cyst-chalazion/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Suspected malignancy</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to refer urgently if malignancy is suspected is based on expert opinion that for suspicious lesions, biopsy to exclude carcinoma is warranted [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/meibomian-cyst-chalazion/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2018</a>]. Suspected cancer referral guidelines from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend a suspected cancer pathway referral (for an appointment within 2 weeks) for people with a skin lesion that may be a squamous cell carcinoma. For suspected basal cell carcinoma (BCC), clinicians are generally advised by NICE to consider routine referral and only consider a suspected cancer pathway referral (for an appointment within 2 weeks) if there is particular concern that a delay may have a significant impact, because of factors such as lesion site or size [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/meibomian-cyst-chalazion/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>]. CKS pragmatically suggests that clinical judgement is exercised, bearing in mind that removal of a BCC from the eyelid may be more complicated than from other sites.</li></ul><h5>Treatment options if the cyst is unresponsive to conservative treatment</h5><ul><li>The recommendation that no treatment or referral are considered as options if there is no improvement after 4 weeks is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.
