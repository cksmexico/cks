The risk varies with the type of antipsychotic (first-generation or second-generation) and the individual drug. </strong><strong>Adverse effects include:</strong><ul><li><strong>Extrapyramidal symptoms</strong> - more common with first-generation antipsychotics. They include:<ul><li>Dystonic reactions (abnormal movements of the face and body), and pseudoparkinsonism (tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity) - these can be alleviated by antimuscarinic drugs, such as procyclidine (should not be prescribed routinely).</li><li>Akathisia (motor restlessness) - can often be relieved by reducing the dose of the antipsychotic.</li><li>Tardive dyskinesia - late-onset movement disorder that can occur with prolonged use of antipsychotics. It is characterized by rhythmical, involuntary movements, usually lip-smacking and tongue rotating, although it can affect the limbs and trunk. It may be persistent and can sometimes worsen on treatment withdrawal. The drug should be discontinued on appearance of early signs.</li><li>Oculogyric crisis has been reported as an adverse effect of aripiprazole.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Weight gain - </strong>common with all antipsychotics, but more frequent with second-generation antipsychotics. In general, clozapine and olanzapine have the greatest potential to cause weight gain, followed by chlorpromazine, quetiapine, and risperidone.</li><li><strong>Dyslipidaemia - </strong>phenothiazines (such as chlorpromazine), clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone all increase lipid levels. Offer dietary advice and consider treatment with a statin according to national guidelines.</li><li><strong>Hyperprolactinaemia - </strong>most antipsychotics can cause hyperprolactinaemia that may lead to galactorrhoea, amenorrhoea, gynaecomastia, hypogonadism, sexual dysfunction, and an increased risk of osteoporosis. Clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole do not increase prolactin above the normal range in standard doses.</li><li><strong>Sedation - </strong>chlorpromazine, clozapine, promazine, and zotepine cause the highest incidence of sedation. Amisulpride, aripiprazole, sertindole, and sulpiride are associated with a very low incidence of sedation. Performance of skilled tasks (such as driving) may be affected; effects of alcohol are enhanced. Tolerance to sedation usually develops.</li><li><strong>Anticholinergic effects </strong>(such as dry mouth, blurred vision, urinary retention, constipation, and cutaneous flushing) — chlorpromazine and clozapine have potent anticholinergic effects. Tolerance may develop, but it is very variable, and these adverse effects are often poorly tolerated.</li><li><strong>Postural hypotension - </strong>commonly associated with clozapine, chlorpromazine, aripiprazole, quetiapine, and risperidone.</li><li><strong>Hypertension - </strong>commonly reported with clozapine but there are also reports with aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone. Hypertension can occur as:<ul><li>A small, steady increase in blood pressure over time (may be associated with weight gain), <em>or</em></li><li>An unpredictable, sharp increase in blood pressure on starting a new drug.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Reduced seizure threshold - </strong>seizures are a recognized adverse effect of antipsychotics (the higher the dose, the greater the risk). Clozapine carries the greatest risk.</li><li><strong>Impaired glucose tolerance - </strong>has been associated with both first-generation and second-generation antipsychotic drugs. Hyperglycaemia, and sometimes diabetes (including ketoacidosis and coma) can occur in people taking clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine.</li><li><strong>QT interval prolongation - </strong>the most widely reported cardiac conduction defect caused by antipsychotics and considered to be a class effect. However aripiprazole and paliperidone are thought to have no effect on the QT interval.<ul><li>Avoid co-prescribing other drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval (for example tricyclic antidepressants, erythromycin, or antiarrhythmics), and monitor potassium levels at least annually as there is an increased risk of arrhythmia if the person has hypokalaemia.</li><li>People taking antipsychotics who experience palpitations or any other symptoms that suggest cardiac disease should undergo electrocardiography.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Stroke risk - </strong>olanzapine and risperidone have been associated with an increased risk of stroke in elderly people with dementia. The Committee on Safety of Medicines advised that:<ul><li>For acute psychotic conditions in elderly people with dementia, risperidone should be limited to short-term use under specialist advice; olanzapine is not licensed for acute psychosis.</li><li>The possibility of cerebrovascular events should be considered carefully before treating people with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack; risk factors for cerebrovascular disease (for example hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and atrial fibrillation) should also be considered.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) - </strong>antipsychotic use may be associated with an increased risk of VTE.<ul><li>Data are insufficient to determine any difference in risk between second-generation and first-generation antipsychotics, or between individual drugs.</li><li>All possible risk factors for VTE should be identified before and during antipsychotic treatment and preventive measures undertaken.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)- </strong>is a rare but potentially fatal adverse effect of all antipsychotics. Signs and symptoms of NMS include fever, increased sweating, rigidity, confusion, fluctuating consciousness, fluctuating blood pressure, tachycardia, raised creatine kinase, leucocytosis, and raised liver function tests.</li><li><strong>Pneumonia - </strong>recent evidence from observational studies suggest that all antipsychotics are associated with an increased risk of pneumonia. The mechanism by which this occurs is unclear.</li><li><strong>Neutropenia - </strong>stop the suspected drug if neutrophils fall below 1.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L and seek urgent advice from a secondary care specialist.</li><li><strong>Abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) - </strong>stop the suspected drug if LFTs suggest hepatitis (transaminases rise to three times normal) or prothrombin time or albumin are abnormal. Seek advice from a secondary care specialist.</li><li><strong>Photosensitivity - </strong>is common with chlorpromazine. Adequate use of sunscreen should prevent sunburn in affected people. Some high-factor sunscreens (sun protection factor 30 or above) are available on prescription. The prescription should be endorsed with ACBS.</li><li><strong>Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders</strong> <strong>-</strong> olanzapine has been associated with Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), frequency unknown.</li><li><strong>Diplopia - </strong>is an uncommon side effect with aripiprazole.</li><li><strong>Misuse and abuse </strong><strong>-</strong> cases of misuse and abuse have been reported with quetiapine. Quetiapine should be prescribed with caution in people who have a history of drug or alcohol abuse.</li><li><strong>Salivary hypersecretion.</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bipolar-disorder/references/\">CSM, 2004</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bipolar-disorder/references/\">Taylor et al, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bipolar-disorder/references/\">ABPI, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bipolar-disorder/references/\">ABPI, 2019a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bipolar-disorder/references/\">ABPI, 2019b</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bipolar-disorder/references/\">Joint Formulary Committee, 2019</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bipolar-disorder/references/\">ABPI, 2020</a>] </p><!-- end field 4b1858cf-b89a-4023-a489-e7778931c037 --><!-- end item 7b5fce7b-1424-47ce-b481-5d393094bcdb -->","subChapters":[]},{"id":"4b56cdee-7bf7-5320-94f8-087c96f29cc3","slug":"drug-interactions","fullItemName":"Drug interactions","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 44245e97-d884-4ab9-a0c4-89c1f13549b4 --><h3>What are the drug interactions of antipsychotics?</h3><!-- end field 44245e97-d884-4ab9-a0c4-89c1f13549b4 -->","summary":"","htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 4be90fdb-7a74-4f40-b130-fba961e21eca --><!-- begin field 37295b26-b5dc-4b4d-8da6-b7857178cbc0 --><ul><li><strong>The following interactions are common to all antipsychotics:</strong><ul><li><strong>Drugs with a sedative action </strong>(such as alcohol, analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, and sedating antihistamines) will enhance the sedative effects of antipsychotics.</li><li><strong>Drugs with a hypotensive effect </strong>(for example antihypertensives) will enhance the hypotensive effect of antipsychotics.</li><li><strong>Drugs that prolong the QT interval, </strong>such as anti-arrhythmics, macrolides (for example erythromycin), and tricyclic antidepressants, may have a synergistic effect on the QT interval.
