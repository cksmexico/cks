Although this may occur, it should not be a reason for stopping lithium treatment. Levothyroxine replacement is usually indicated. Thyroxine function tests usually return to normal when lithium is discontinued.</li><li><strong>Hyperthyroidism: </strong>lithium-associated thyrotoxicosis is rare and occurs mainly after long-term use. It should not constitute an absolute contraindication to lithium treatment. Specialist advice should be sought regarding management.</li><li><strong>Hyperparathyroidism: </strong>lithium use has been associated with hypercalcaemia accompanied by elevations in circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH). The coexistence of hypercalcaemia and elevated PTH levels suggests primary hyperparathyroidism. However, significantly greater serum levels of calcium are probably required to inhibit PTH secretion during lithium therapy. The presence of mild hypercalcaemia with elevated PTH is consistent with lithium-induced hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroid surgery is not indicated in this situation, and withdrawal of lithium will result in prompt normalization of serum calcium and PTH levels.</li><li><strong>Nephrotoxicity: </strong>a small reduction in glomerular filtration rate is seen in 20% of people taking lithium. In the vast majority of these people this effect is benign. A very small number of people taking lithium may develop interstitial nephritis. Lithium can also cause a reduction in urinary concentrating capacity (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, with symptoms of thirst and polyuria) which is reversible in the short-to-medium term, but may be irreversible after long-term treatment (greater than 15 years).</li><li><strong>Renal tumours: </strong>cases of microcysts, oncocytomas, and collecting duct renal carcinoma have been reported in people with severe renal impairment who received lithium for more than 10 years.</li><li><strong>Rhabdomyolysis: </strong>muscle weakness and rhabdomyolysis have been reported in people taking lithium.</li></ul></li><li>The National Patient Safety Agency has developed a lithium patient information booklet.

The most commonly encountered interactions are with:</strong><ul><li><strong>Diuretics — </strong>thiazide diuretics can cause a rapid increase in serum lithium levels (7–10 days) by reducing clearance of lithium. The increase in lithium levels varies from 25–400% Loop diuretics also cause lithium retention but are less likely to result in lithium toxicity.</li><li><strong>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) — </strong>may increase serum lithium levels. The increase in lithium varies from 40–50%. The mechanism of this interaction is thought to be related to the effects of NSAIDs on fluid balance. This is particularly important if NSAIDs are added to a long-standing prescription of lithium.</li><li><strong>Haloperidol  — </strong>severe neurotoxicity has been reported with this combination, however successful and uneventful use of this combination has also been reported.</li><li><strong>Carbamazepine </strong>in combination with lithium has been reported to cause neurotoxic reactions . However successful and uneventful use of this combination has also been reported.</li><li><strong>Antidepressants </strong>with a serotonergic action (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, venlafaxine, duloxetine) have rarely been linked to an increased incidence of central nervous system toxicity when used with lithium.</li><li><strong>ACE inhibitors </strong>decrease the excretion of lithium. They can also precipitate renal failure. If these two drugs are prescribed together, extra care is required in monitoring both serum creatinine and lithium levels.</li><li><strong>Drugs that prolong the QT-interval</strong> — potential for additive effects when co-administered.</li><li><strong>Drugs that cause hypokalaemia</strong> — potentially increased risk of torsade de points when co-administered.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bipolar-disorder/references/\">Taylor et al, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bipolar-disorder/references/\">Preston, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bipolar-disorder/references/\">ABPI, 2018b</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bipolar-disorder/references/\">Joint Formulary Committee, 2019</a>]</p><!-- end field ba508e60-c69b-479c-8bfc-239a358e6ef5 --><!-- end item 38139a65-9297-4dab-a0d4-ac8ab220119a -->","subChapters":[]},{"id":"e0dd520f-114e-5b2d-95bd-88b8bcf10c2f","slug":"monitoring","fullItemName":"Monitoring","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field c7c6bb81-8da7-40de-bbdc-5a9876054783 --><h3>How should I monitor someone taking lithium?</h3><!-- end field c7c6bb81-8da7-40de-bbdc-5a9876054783 -->","summary":"","htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 7e0e2c8c-7e36-4cea-a389-5504b7fd226b --><!-- begin field 8af1355c-c7f5-42b6-a1c8-c90bb49c8256 --><ul><li><strong>Lithium levels are normally measured </strong>one week after starting treatment, one week after every dose change, and weekly until the levels are stable.
