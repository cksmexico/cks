2018a</a>].</li><li>The recommendation that symptoms of overactive or disinhibited behaviour should last at least 4 days is based on expert opinion from the <em>Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders </em>(DSM-5) and <em>International Classification of Diseases </em>(ICD 10) which both require a minimum of 4 days of hypomanic symptoms to diagnose a hypomanic episode [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bipolar-disorder/references/\">WHO, 1992</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bipolar-disorder/references/\">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</a>].</li><li>The questions suggested to elicit a history of mania or hypomania derive from expert opinion within a review article on bipolar disorder [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bipolar-disorder/references/\">Anderson et al, 2012</a>].</li></ul><h4>Blood tests</h4><ul><li>The advice to consider thyroid function tests, full blood count, vitamin D, or other blood tests (including a toxicology screen) to rule out differential diagnoses is based on expert opinion within the BMJ Best Practice guideline <em>Bipolar disorder in adults </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bipolar-disorder/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2018</a>] which states that:<ul><li>Hyperthyroidism may mimic manic or hypomanic states.</li><li>Hypothyroidism can produce mental depression.</li><li>Serum vitamin D should be performed to exclude other possible causes of mood symptoms.</li><li>Toxicology screen should be performed to exclude other possible causes of mood symptoms — symptoms observed in manic, mixed, or hypomanic episodes may occur as part of an intoxication or withdrawal phenomenon from a drug of misuse.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation to use clinical judgement to determine if any and which of these tests are required is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><!-- end field b80c04d8-8db1-4c47-a4f1-796ffcecf7de --><!-- end item
