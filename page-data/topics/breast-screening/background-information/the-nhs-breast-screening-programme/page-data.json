NHS Breast Screening Programme in England was set up in 1988, and provides 3-yearly routine breast screening to women [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\"

in the breast before there are any other symptoms or signs of breast cancer.</li><li>Breast screening detects about 30% of breast cancers and is estimated to save about 1300 lives per year in the UK.</li><li>If breast cancer is found at an early stage, there is an increased chance for breast-conserving surgery and a better prognosis for long-term survival.</li><li> One in nine women will develop breast cancer, and it is more common in women 50 years or older.</li></ul></li><li>Invitations for routine mammography screening are sent out to women aged 50–70 years in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-screening/references/\">PHE, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/breast-screening/references/\">PHE, 2017a</a>].<ul><li>Some women aged 47–49 years and 71–73 years in England are also invited for screening as part of an ongoing cluster-randomized trial of extending the breast screening age-range.</li><li>Women aged over 70 years are invited to make their own appointments every 3 years.</li></ul></li><li>Contact details for local breast
