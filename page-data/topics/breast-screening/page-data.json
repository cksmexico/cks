years.</li><li>The NHS Breast Screening Programme in England was set up in 1988, and provides 3-yearly routine breast screening to women.<ul><li>Breast screening uses mammography radiography to detect small changes in the breast before other symptoms or signs of breast cancer.</li><li>Breast screening detects about 30% of breast cancers and is estimated to save 1300 lives per year in the UK.</li><li>If breast cancer is found at an early stage, there is an increased chance of breast-conserving surgery and a better prognosis of long-term survival.</li></ul></li><li>Invitations for routine mammography screening are sent out to women aged 50–70 years in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.<ul><li>Some women aged 47–49 years and 71–73 years in England are also invited for screening as part of an ongoing cluster-randomized trial of extending the breast screening age-range.</li><li>Women aged over 70 years are invited to make their own appointments every 3 years.</li><li>Women at increased risk of breast cancer (for example with a strong family history) may be eligible for breast screening before 50 years of age.</li></ul></li><li>Women should be supported to make an informed decision about participation in the breast screening programme, and should be informed about:<ul><li>How breast screening is organized.</li><li>Where the mammogram is likely to be done.</li><li>Preparing for the mammogram.</li><li>What to expect at and after their appointment.</li></ul></li><li>Benefits of breast screening include:<ul><li>Reduction in mortality.</li><li>More breast-conserving treatment due to an increase in early detection of breast cancer.</li></ul></li><li>Harms of breast screening include:<ul><li>Over-diagnosis leading to unnecessary treatment.</li><li>False-positive mammograms, leading to unnecessary further investigations.</li><li>False reassurance, due to missed cancer and incorrect diagnosis.</li><li>Pain and discomfort, due to mammography.</li><li>Psychological distress, such as anxiety or uncertainty, for example following a false-positive result.</li><li>Radiation exposure, which may increase the risk of breast cancer.</li></ul></li><li>Women with breast implants should be informed that some of the breast tissue in women with implants is obscured by the radiopaque implant during routine mammography.<ul><li>Additional screening images may be taken at the initial mammography appointment, to visualise as much breast tissue as possible to improve cancer detection rates.</li></ul></li><li>Women with a physical disability that may make breast screening difficult should:<ul><li>Be advised to contact the local breast screening service to get advice on whether mammography is technically possible, and where the best place would be to attend.</li></ul></li><li>Women with a learning disability or who lack mental capacity to make an informed decision about breast screening should:<ul><li>Be assessed for whether she has fluctuating mental capacity, in which case, the decision about participating in screening should be delayed until the woman is able to decide for herself.</li><li>Have a best interests decision made on her behalf if she has ongoing lack of mental capacity to make an informed decision.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field
