It presents most commonly in the winter months.</li><li>The exact cause of OME is uncertain, but over 50% of cases are thought to follow an episode of acute otitis media, especially in children under 3 years of age. Persistence of OME may be caused by one or more of the following:<ul><li>Impaired eustachian tube function causing poor aeration of the middle ear.</li><li>Low-grade viral or bacterial infection.</li><li>Persistent local inflammatory reaction.</li><li>Adenoidal infection or hypertrophy.</li></ul></li><li>OME is more common in children with cleft palate, Down's syndrome, cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and allergic rhinitis.</li><li>Several environmental factors (such as low socioeconomic group, parental smoking and frequent upper-respiratory infections) may increase the chance of a child developing OME. </li><li>Complications include:<ul><li>Conductive hearing loss.</li><li>Speech and language development, and communications skills difficulties.</li><li>Chronic damage to the tympanic membrane.</li></ul></li><li>Children with Down’s syndrome or a cleft palate should be regularly assessed for OME by an ENT specialist.</li><li>Diagnosis of suspected OME is based on suspected hearing loss, taking a clinical history, examining the ears, considering the need for a wider examination of the respiratory system, including the nose and throat, excluding alternative diagnoses (for example acute otitis media, foreign body, impacted wax, and balance disorders), confirming the diagnosis with tympanometry and assessing hearing loss with audiometry. </li><li>Spontaneous resolution of OME is common, so for most children a period of active observation over 6–12 weeks is appropriate. If signs and symptoms persist, the child should be referred for a hearing test or to a specialist in ear, nose, and throat (ENT) if direct referral for audiometry is not available.</li><li>Referral to ENT should also be made if:<ul><li>The child has Down's syndrome or has a cleft palate.</li><li>Hearing loss is severe and/or associated with a significant impact on the child's quality of life.</li><li>Significant hearing loss persists on two documented occasions.</li><li>The tympanic membrane is structurally abnormal (or there are other features suggesting an alternative diagnosis).</li><li>There is a persistent, foul-smelling discharge suggestive of a possible cholesteatoma — referral should be urgent (within 2 weeks).</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 130b81f9-54a4-464b-9458-6fae4589c185 --><!-- end item 7055f210-0618-470e-8ee4-eb3ba0d6dc81 -->","topic":{"id":"06ed44fb-6af9-5912-9268-d098dafc4ea4","topicId":"143b989d-6e1c-4842-b6a1-3ec6699d1010","topicName":"Otitis media with effusion","slug":"otitis-media-with-effusion","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"ef75e563-b8ab-5837-bde3-989758f61d8b","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"329a4a82-ff9c-5b21-ae04-734169594fac","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"7366122a-7de6-501d-8b1a-7d847d4c12bb","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"abe8190d-6401-57b4-bdf5-c909ec724773","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"0ea92db2-cd30-5ee8-aa54-29f1100ccfa4","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"72fc63ec-5417-54d3-bef8-3cbbd17c7da5","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"f52feda4-8b04-58cb-b998-5f2cba350ee3","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"cfef2fa6-9ee7-5b42-b7c5-b6e1c5451f9d","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"5729a2a9-2933-5b64-ad96-4b9e13888477","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"01fb1844-3220-5a35-99be-ea69c08c6fdc","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"d1d6d91e-707f-550d-9bdc-c72b53c41edb","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
