See the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/incontinence-urinary-in-women/\">Incontinence - urinary, in women</a> for more information.</li><li>Mood changes (including anxiety, irritability, and depression) — these symptoms may not be due to the menopause alone. General population studies suggest that most women do not experience major changes in mood during the menopause transition. See the CKS topics on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/generalized-anxiety-disorder/\">Generalized anxiety disorder</a> and <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression/\">Depression</a> for more information.</li><li>Sleep disturbance — may be associated with the normal ageing process. See the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/insomnia/\">Insomnia</a> for more information.</li><li>Cognitive impairment (such as memory problems or difficulty concentrating) — cross-sectional studies suggest that these symptoms are unlikely to be related to the menopause.</li><li>Loss of libido — this may be attributed to androgen deficiency, however other non-hormonal factors, such as insomnia, inadequate sexual stimulation, life stresses, and depression, may also contribute to symptoms.</li><li>Muscle and joint pains — pain and swelling resulting in restriction of mobility most often affects the small joints of the hands and feet as well as the knees, elbows, and cervical spine. These symptoms have been linked to a decrease in oestrogen levels, but other musculoskeletal causes (such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis) are possible. See the CKS topics on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/osteoarthritis/\">Osteoarthritis</a> and <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/rheumatoid-arthritis/\">Rheumatoid arthritis</a> for more information.</li><li>Skin changes — it is difficult to separate skin changes due to ageing, smoking, and sun exposure, from skin changes due to declining hormonal secretion and menopause. Soon after the menopause, skin collagen content and skin thickness decrease, resulting in decreased skin elasticity.</li><li>Weight gain — this is unlikely to be solely due to the perimenopause or menopause. Body weight in women tends to increase with age, especially beginning at or near the menopause (the average weight gain ranges from 2.25–4.19 kg). Body fat redistribution to the abdomen also occurs with age (independently of weight gain). See the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/obesity/\">Obesity</a> for more information.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field fc5b651d-e6f3-4a50-9d69-c5e73e884baf --><!-- end item 81db53eb-ad65-46aa-b988-b759ce7d31a6 -->","topic":{"id":"69003588-b736-585d-8a5d-7ca0e916caa5","topicId":"f75fa6a7-10c6-4887-9cf1-3ea14d7f353c","topicName":"Menopause","slug":"menopause","lastRevised":"Last revised in November 2020","chapters":[{"id":"0359e5fa-1342-5767-a4da-2f8b5cd2b6db","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"c978ff88-dda8-5879-a0ac-9b09182d81d1","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"d381eed9-6611-5263-a3be-b46ec9f02058","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"ddcba55c-566e-5433-8dce-2e5f5cee0ba4","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"e521b2f5-34d4-580f-b63d-a1ec2d0c13a3","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"ab5690cf-81b4-5fa9-b69f-27abc2e034a3","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"c0f45ff8-442c-5027-922e-12d108200960","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"8459ae09-bdf2-5d0d-9728-538e93d05a8f","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"43027e52-84ef-53fa-88c5-a84289154e48","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"4620ee3c-97ae-5f9f-8bac-fc8497801cdb","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"b26fb3cf-562a-595a-8f9e-92fd752d2e6b","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
