symptoms suggesting menopause or perimenopause are largely based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>], together with the EMAS position statements [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">Mintziori, 2015</a>; <a

clinical practice guideline, the North American Menopause Society position statement, and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">Hickey, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">Monteleone, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">Pinkerton, 2020</a>].</li><li>The information on the difference between low mood often seen in menopause and depression is based on the NICE clinical guideline, and is also supported by the EMAS position statement [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">Armeni, 2016</a>].</li><li>The information on the clinical features of genitourinary syndrome of menopause is based on the NICE clinical guideline, the EMAS position statement [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">Armeni, 2016</a>], and expert opinion in a review article, which notes that thinning of the vulva mucosa may cause constriction of the introitus, resulting in entry dyspareunia, as can narrowing of the vagina and decreased lubrication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">Hill, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Not routinely using serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) measurements to diagnose menopause</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is largely based on the NICE clinical guideline, which states there is no need for laboratory tests to diagnose perimenopause or menopause in otherwise healthy women aged over 45 years with typical menopausal symptoms [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>].<ul><li>NICE recommends not using serum FSH levels to diagnose menopause in women using combined oestrogen and progestogen contraception or high-dose progestogen.</li><li>NICE advises to take into account that it can be difficult to diagnose menopause in women who are taking hormonal treatments, for example for the treatment of heavy periods.</li><li>NICE reviewed the available evidence from 21 studies of low- to moderate-quality, to determine the diagnostic accuracy of age, menopausal symptoms, biochemical measurements (FSH, anti-Müllerian hormone, antral follicle count, inhibin B, inhibin A, and oestrogen), and ultrasound features (ovarian volume) to diagnose perimenopause and postmenopause. These indexes were considered both individually and in combination.<ul><li>The evidence showed that when examined in isolation, no indication (age, vasomotor symptoms, biochemical measures, endocrine changes, or ultrasound features) was found to accurately diagnose the menopause. However, algorithms either as combinations of menstrual (classifying women according to the time since their last period), hormonal (classifying women according to their menstrual history, surgical history, age, FSH and oestradiol levels), and historical (classifying women according to their menstrual history, surgical history, and age) allowed for the correct classification of both premenopausal and perimenopausal women.</li></ul></li><li>The NICE guideline development group concluded that:<ul><li>Age over 45 years and amenorrhoea for at least 12 months are sufficient clinical indicators for the routine diagnosis of menopause.</li><li>Biochemical measurements, hormonal tests, and ultrasound tests are not useful in the routine diagnosis of menopause and perimenopause and should not be used to diagnose these conditions in women aged over 45 years.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>This approach is supported by the EMAS position statement, which advises not to measure FSH in menopausal women over 45 years of age or perimenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms and irregular periods [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">Armeni, 2016</a>].</li></ul><h5>When to consider using serum FSH measurements to diagnose menopause</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on when to consider using FSH measurements are largely based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>], together with the FSRH clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">FSRH, 2019</a>], the EMAS position statement [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">Armeni, 2016</a>], and the BMS publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">Marsden, 2019</a>].<ul><li>The recommendation that FSH levels should not be measured if a woman is taking combined hormonal contraception is based on the NICE clinical guideline, which notes that the diagnostic accuracy of FSH levels may be affected by women taking hormonal treatment. In addition, the FSRH clinical guideline notes that women using combined hormonal contraception have very suppressed levels of estradiol, FSH, and LH even if measured during the hormone-free interval, so these investigations cannot be used to assess menopausal status.</li><li>The recommendation that FSH levels should not be measured if a woman is taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is based on the FSRH clinical guideline, which notes that measurement of FSH is unreliable while taking HRT, as serum levels can be very variable and may be suppressed. </li><li>The recommendation about women with atypical symptoms is based on the NICE guideline development group, which noted that FSH measurement may occasionally be useful for the diagnosis of menopause and perimenopause in women over the age of 45 years who do not have typical menopause symptoms (such as vasomotor symptoms), but have atypical symptoms of recent onset. However, they highlighted there is a lack of precision of FSH measurements in the perimenopause as it fluctuates significantly over short periods of time in the years leading up to the menopause.</li><li>The recommendation about women aged between 40–45 years with menopausal symptoms is based on the NICE clinical guideline. This is supported by the BMS publication, which notes that FSH monitoring may be used in the diagnosis of early menopause in women with breast cancer on tamoxifen and chemotherapy.</li><li>The recommendation about women with a suspected diagnosis of premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is based on the NICE clinical guideline.</li><li>The recommendation about women aged over 50 years using progestogen-only contraception, including depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), is based on the FSRH clinical guideline. CKS notes that this recommendation differs from that in the NICE clinical guideline, which recommends that gonadotrophins including FSH should not be measured in women using hormonal treatments. <ul><li>The FSRH clinical guideline notes that during perimenopause, isolated serum estradiol, FSH, and LH levels can be misleading and should not be used as a basis for providing advice about stopping contraception. Ovulation may still occur with risk of pregnancy, particularly in young women with a diagnosis of POI. It recommends serum FSH measurement should be used to advise about stopping contraception in women over 50 years of age using progestogen-only contraception who are amenorrhoeic.</li><li>The recommendation to recheck the FSH level after 1 year if it is in the premenopausal range is based on the FSRH clinical guideline.</li></ul></li><li>The EMAS position statement recommends considering the use of FSH measurement in younger women, those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or when investigating the differential diagnosis of amenorrhoea.</li><li>The NICE clinical guideline does not give any specific guidance on how to test for or interpret serum FSH levels.<ul><li>The information that a single serum FSH level more than 30 IU/L indicates a degree of ovarian insufficiency, but not necessarily sterility, is based on the FSRH clinical guideline.</li><li>The BMS document recommends diagnosing menopause in women with breast cancer with an elevated FSH level (more than 30 IU/L) on two blood samples taken 4–6 weeks apart.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 3d3d35e5-9a4f-43e0-b111-71a0f27f37ec --><!-- end item 92fa9803-7ab1-4d07-b6e9-7a1f6abd8d83 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
