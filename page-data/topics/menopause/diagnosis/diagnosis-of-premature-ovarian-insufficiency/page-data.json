ovarian insufficiency are based largely on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline <em>Menopause</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>], the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) guideline <em>Management of women with premature ovarian insufficiency</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">ESHRE, 2015</a>], the European Menopause and Andropause Society (EMAS) position statement <em>Maintaining postreproductive health: a care pathway from the European Menopause and Andropause Society (EMAS)</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">Armeni, 2016</a>], the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) clinical guideline <em>Contraception for women aged over 40 years</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">FSRH, 2019</a>], and the Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline <em>Treatment of symptoms of the menopause</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">Stuenkel, 2015</a>].</p><h5>When to suspect premature ovarian insufficiency (POI)</h5><ul><li>The recommendation on when to suspect a diagnosis of POI is largely based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>].<ul><li>The NICE clinical guideline states that the presence of menopausal symptoms and elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels on two blood samples in a woman younger than 40 years indicates a diagnosis of POI.</li><li>NICE reviewed the evidence from three studies (low- to very low-quality evidence) of women at high risk of POI, to determine the diagnostic accuracy of cycle irregularity, vasomotor symptoms, FSH level, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), antral follicle count (AFC), inhibin B, inhibin A, oestrogen, and ovarian volume. These indexes were considered either individually or in combination.<ul><li>Limited evidence showed that FSH levels more than 30 mIU/mL can be a useful diagnostic tool for women at high risk of POI who have already started hormone replacement therapy (HRT).</li><li>Evidence on the other diagnostic tools, such as inhibin B, oestradiol, and AFC (and the combination of tests), found that these tests may not be useful in the diagnosis of POI.</li></ul></li><li>The NICE guideline development group discussed the clinical relevance of the results and the limitations of the interpretation of FSH levels (which tend to fluctuate widely over time) and recommended the repeat of FSH measurements in two blood tests between 4–6 weeks apart. This time interval was based on the group's expertise and clinical experience.<ul><li>NICE noted that some women present for a diagnosis of POI to be confirmed whilst on HRT, when there may have been some doubt about the pre-treatment diagnosis, but treatment was started because of symptoms. NICE states if despite HRT, FSH levels are still elevated in these women, it is very likely they have POI.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>This approach is supported by the ESHRE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">ESHRE, 2015</a>], the EMAS position statement [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">Armeni, 2016</a>], and the Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">Stuenkel, 2015</a>].<ul><li>The ESHRE guideline states that a history of oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea for at least 4 months, <em>and</em> an elevated FSH level more than 25 IU/L on two occasions more than 4 weeks apart, is sufficient to diagnose POI.</li><li>Similarly, the EMAS position statement recommends the diagnosis is confirmed if there are two elevated FSH levels at least 1 month apart.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation that FSH levels should not be measured if a woman is taking combined hormonal contraception is based on the NICE clinical guideline, which notes that the diagnostic accuracy of FSH levels may be affected by women taking hormonal treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>]. In addition, it is extrapolated from the FSRH clinical guideline, which notes that women using combined hormonal contraception have very suppressed levels of estradiol, FSH, and luteinizing hormone (LH) even if measured during the hormone-free interval, so these investigations cannot be used to assess menopausal status [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">FSRH, 2019</a>].</li><li>The information on checking additional LH, oestradiol, prolactin, testosterone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels if there is suspected POI is based on the EMAS position statement [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">Armeni, 2016</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to not use serum AMH levels routinely to diagnose POI is largely based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">NICE, 2019</a>].<ul><li>It noted that AMH does not fluctuate significantly within or between menstrual cycles, but it is an expensive test that is not widely available in primary care, results may be inconsistent depending on the AMH assay used, and results may be affected by the use of combined hormonal contraceptives and HRT. The guideline development group concluded that this test should not be used in isolation to diagnose women with POI.</li><li>Similarly, the EMAS position statement notes that AMH levels may be used to check ovarian reserve in women with POI seeking fertility treatment, but there are concerns about the lack of standardized AMH assays [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menopause/references/\">Armeni, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 283c6e9a-b6a7-48bf-a5d0-fdfee53f754d --><!-- end item 35c9cd0e-8d21-4648-ae24-e6e2d1af6bdc -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
