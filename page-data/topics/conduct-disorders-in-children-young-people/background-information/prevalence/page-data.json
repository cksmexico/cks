For example, 7% of boys and 3% of girls aged 5 to10 years have conduct disorders; in children aged 11 to 16 years the proportion rises to 8% of boys and 5% of girls [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/conduct-disorders-in-children-young-people/references/\">NICE, 2017a</a>].</li><li>The prevalence of conduct disorders in the UK varies across ethnic groups, with rates being lower than average in children and young people of south Asian family origin and higher than average in children and young people of African-Caribbean family origin [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/conduct-disorders-in-children-young-people/references/\">NICE, 2017a</a>].</li><li>A large UK observational study performed by the Office of National Statistics between 1999 and 2004 found that nearly 40% of children who are being 'looked after' (for example in foster care or children's homes), or who have been abused, or who are on the child protection or safeguarding register, meet the diagnositc criteria for conduct disorders [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/conduct-disorders-in-children-young-people/references/\">Green et al, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/conduct-disorders-in-children-young-people/references/\">NICE, 2017a</a>].</li><li>Oppositional defiant disorder is more common in children aged 10 years or younger; the other subtypes of conduct disorder are more common in those aged over 11 years or older [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/conduct-disorders-in-children-young-people/references/\">NICE, 2017a</a>].</li><li>Conduct disorders are the most common reason for referral of young children to child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and also also comprise a considerable proportion of the work of the health and social care system. For example, 30% of a typical GP's child consultations are for behavioural problems, 45% of community child health referrals are for behaviour disturbances, and psychiatric disorders are a factor in 28% of all paediatric outpatient referrals [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/conduct-disorders-in-children-young-people/references/\">NICE, 2017a</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field 95b81c3b-92d0-422e-b58c-f540fbd7d1bb --><!-- end item 71a6b045-dddb-4a11-ade1-bb9a0c919e50 -->","topic":{"id":"5b431fd1-05a9-56a5-b500-9c93007db332","topicId":"0ee10521-7c63-43a1-9caa-cc3ffd1ae8ae","topicName":"Conduct disorders in children and young people","slug":"conduct-disorders-in-children-young-people","lastRevised":"Last revised in April 2018","chapters":[{"id":"ff86f455-780d-53a9-9fe8-3b13d33937f6","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"f57099d8-a1de-5af0-961c-998de57a0607","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"b2b660db-759d-589a-8af4-8e406dfde295","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"c46c3136-0235-56c1-95f3-33ba2238c3ee","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"efc85d78-d915-53e6-a9f5-a3237191a8b3","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"0f04120b-aafa-5186-b320-86f26df06f44","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"c3bc9749-c69a-558a-bb94-c3ffbe156e78","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"0c109dc8-a769-5aba-aa28-d96fb62f6244","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"94cbf52b-cf7a-5775-bea2-caacce3c2dc1","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"a2e81c30-2393-5eeb-951e-4a5427e2e279","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"4a55b93f-bf20-50da-87f4-abae26ae407c","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP - Options for local implementation"},{"id":"01c9959b-5d38-5528-9902-ed7e33ba8a3f","slug":"nice-quality-standards","fullItemName":"NICE quality standards"}]},{"id":"723ff660-52de-5c99-9774-c778bb7fdcd3","fullItemName":"Background information","slug":"background-information","subChapters":[{"id":"b3d876df-f88f-5e64-bcad-4652b5b0d949","slug":"definition","fullItemName":"Definition"},{"id":"8f08c278-7a06-5f83-81a5-6a4012c3e174","slug":"risk-factors","fullItemName":"Risk factors"},{"id":"c6b29eee-bda9-5b62-b05e-ecf00c1008b7","slug":"prevalence","fullItemName":"Prevalence"},{"id":"c4326198-74ea-5d4d-9184-70a356b4acbf","slug":"prognosis","fullItemName":"Prognosis"}]},{"id":"90fed28c-d5ba-5c85-a819-1e4c0eafbb7c","fullItemName":"Diagnosis","slug":"diagnosis","subChapters":[{"id":"c3f062ff-e21d-56f3-913e-b31355f7f245","slug":"when-to-suspect-a-conduct-disorder","fullItemName":"When to suspect a conduct disorder"}]},{"id":"d17110d9-2513-51e6-8a64-b19ce146ff50","fullItemName":"Management","slug":"management","subChapters":[{"id":"3249b402-9e2d-526d-b90f-9db307e80224","slug":"managing-suspected-conduct-disorders","fullItemName":"Scenario: Managing suspected conduct disorders"}]},{"id":"55f6aca2-a769-51fb-b6b1-e6ef52fec211","fullItemName":"Supporting evidence","slug":"supporting-evidence","subChapters":[]},{"id":"90a5c416-6a42-52d1-94b9-23e09d3e4bbc","fullItemName":"How this topic was developed","slug":"how-this-topic-was-developed","subChapters":[{"id":"8cce396e-aa00-5d47-90ed-311a5d0268f7","slug":"search-strategy","fullItemName":"Search strategy"},{"id":"8a8b3cd8-4c4f-5140-93e8-6415015c5c95","slug":"stakeholder-engagement","fullItemName":"Stakeholder engagement"},{"id":"8cf89a80-100e-590f-9279-13ece0416839","slug":"evidence-exclusion-criteria","fullItemName":"Evidence exclusion criteria"},{"id":"d16e13e7-a18a-5467-80b3-e1f12be7c207","slug":"organizational-behavioural-financial-barriers","fullItemName":"Organizational, behavioural and financial barriers"},{"id":"b26a025d-8948-5b3e-b7c8-8c849fd6b1c4","slug":"declarations-of-interest","fullItemName":"Declarations of interest"}]},{"id":"3b47728b-eeb0-591a-b3cb-82d06ebd47c9","fullItemName":"References","slug":"references","subChapters":[]}]},"parentChapter":{"id":"723ff660-52de-5c99-9774-c778bb7fdcd3","slug":"background-information","fullItemName":"Background information"},"subChapters":[]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
