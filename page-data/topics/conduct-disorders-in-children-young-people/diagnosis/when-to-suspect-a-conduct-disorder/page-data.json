Unlike conduct disorder, this behaviour does not violate societal norms or the rights of others.

Symptom onset is usually within 1 to 3 months of the psychological stressor and lasts for up to 6 months.</li><li><strong>Bipolar disorder </strong>— it can be difficult to distinguish conduct disorder from the symptoms of early bipolar disorder as these both include defiance and irritability in addition to a disregard for rules and behaviour that violates the rights of others.</li><li><strong>Depressive disorders </strong>— children and young people with depression may present with irritability and oppositional symptoms. However, unlike conduct disorder, mood is usually low and there may be associated disturbances to appetite (increased or decreased) and sleep (insomnia or increased sleep), and loss of interest or loss of pleasure.</li><li><strong>Autistic spectrum disorder </strong>— emotional lability, aggressive outbursts and destructive behaviour (often due to anxiety resulting from unexpected change in routine or sensory overload) may be seen in some children with autism. Asking about other symptoms of the autistic spectrum such as sensory hypersensitivity, impairments in social awareness or understanding, difficulties in forming or keeping peer relationships may suggest the presence of autistic spectrum disorder. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/autism-in-children/\">Autism in children</a>.</li><li><strong>Dissocial and antisocial personality disorder </strong>— symptoms are similar to that of conduct disorder, however this condition is usually diagnosed in older children (at least 17 years of age) and is more severe and pervasive. For example all the person's relationships are affected by their behaviour, and beliefs about their antisocial behaviour are characterized by callousness and a lack of remorse.</li><li><strong>Subcultural deviance </strong>— the young person has antisocial behaviour and commits crimes, but they are not particularly aggressive or defiant.</li></ul><!-- end field 02ee2edb-5f01-4542-9f8a-a8cb00e3bb0e --><!-- end item 3355010b-d5c2-4e57-81ff-a8cb00e3b3f4 -->","subChapters":[]},{"id":"6c96e301-30a2-5944-aa87-fe1c140f482e","slug":"basis-for-recommendation-866","fullItemName":"Basis for recommendation","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field f041378d-ec06-4bdf-902c-ebe35f5562f1 --><h3>Basis for recommendation</h3><!-- end field f041378d-ec06-4bdf-902c-ebe35f5562f1 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 8662a285-9444-44b8-bb6d-877a38602c1a --><!-- begin field c38d8214-8e40-4d38-a793-6ae8810a6cb9 --><p>The information on recognition of child maltreatment and conduct disorders is based on expert opinion in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines <em>Antisocial behaviour and conduct disorders in children and young people: recognition and management </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/conduct-disorders-in-children-young-people/references/\">NICE, 2017a</a>] and <em>Child maltreatment: when to suspect maltreatment in under 18s</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/conduct-disorders-in-children-young-people/references/\">NICE, 2017b</a>].</p><!-- end field c38d8214-8e40-4d38-a793-6ae8810a6cb9 --><!-- end item 8662a285-9444-44b8-bb6d-877a38602c1a -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
