National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines <em>Depression: the treatment and management of depression in adults</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2019</a>], <em>Depression in adults with a chronic physical health problem </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2009</a>], and <em>Common mental health disorders: identification and pathways to care</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2011</a>], the British Medical Journal (BMJ) best practice guide <em>Depression in adults</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression/references/\">BMJ, 2019</a>], and a medical textbook <em>The Maudsley prescribing guidelines in psychiatry</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression/references/\">Taylor, 2018</a>].   </p><h4>Choice of diagnostic criteria to confirm the diagnosis of depression</h4><ul><li>Depression is usually confirmed by one of two main classification systems: the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression/references/\">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</a>], or the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression/references/\">WHO, 2018</a>]. </li><li>NICE uses the DSM-IV criteria in preference to ICD-10 criteria as it is used in nearly all the evidence reviewed and it provides definitions for atypical symptoms and seasonal depression. In addition, its definition of severity also makes it less likely that a diagnosis of depression will solely be based on symptom count.  <ul><li>The NICE guideline has not yet been updated to make reference to ICD-11.</li><li>DSM-IV has been replaced with DSM-5 [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression/references/\">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</a>], although NICE guidance has not yet been updated to recommend its use. However, core criteria for diagnosing depression have not changed.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Subthreshold depressive symptoms and persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms (dysthymia)</h4><ul><li>Dysthymia appears as a category in both DSM-5 and ICD-11. NICE recommends the term 'persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms' over dysthymia [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2019</a>]. </li></ul><h4>Investigations for people with depression</h4><ul><li>NICE makes no specific recommendations regarding laboratory tests for depression [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2019</a>], the recommendation that investigations may be required to rule out other diagnoses is based on the BMJ best practice guide [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression/references/\">BMJ, 2019</a>] and a medical textbook [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression/references/\">Taylor, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h4>Severity of depression</h4><ul><li>The classification of the severity of depression is based on the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression/references/\">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</a>]. </li></ul><!-- end field 92620526-aba2-4dc2-a257-a70400ff9dc1 --><!-- end item d2fc6e61-e516-4ce4-8c57-a70400ff9c33 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
