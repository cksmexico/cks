NSAIDs act by blocking prostaglandin production by inhibiting the action of cyclooxygenase (COX, an enzyme responsible for the formation of prostaglandins) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">Marjoribanks, 2015</a>]. <ul><li>The COX enzyme exists in two forms: COX‐1 and COX‐2. Standard NSAIDs (such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and mefenamic acid) are considered 'non-selective' because they inhibit both COX‐1 and COX‐2 enzymes. Coxibs (such as celecoxib and etoricoxib) are highly selective for COX-2 but can interact with COX-1 in certain circumstances.</li></ul></li><li>A Cochrane systematic review (search date January 2015) compared 20 different NSAIDs (18 non‐selective and two COX‐2‐specific) with placebo, paracetamol, or each other in 5820 women with dysmenorrhoea and found that [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">Marjoribanks, 2015</a>]:<ul><li>NSAIDs were more effective for pain relief than placebo but were associated with more adverse effects.</li><li>NSAIDs appeared to be more effective for pain relief than paracetamol. There was no evidence of a difference with regard to adverse effects, although data was very scanty.</li></ul></li><li>A subsequent network meta-analysis compared the efficacy and safety of 13 different NSAIDs in 5723 women with primary dysmenorrhea and found that all NSAIDs except aspirin were significantly more efficacious than placebo [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">Feng, 2018</a>].</li></ul></li><li><strong>Choice of NSAIDs</strong><ul><li>The Cochrane systematic review found little evidence of the superiority of any individual NSAID for either pain relief or safety, but the available evidence had little power to detect such differences as most individual comparisons were based on very few small trials. There was no evidence that COX‐2‐specific inhibitors were more effective or tolerable for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea than standard NSAIDs, although data was very scanty [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">Marjoribanks, 2015</a>]. </li><li>However, according to the results of the network meta-analysis, which calculated the ranking of each treatment using results from a surface under cumulative ranking curve [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">Feng, 2018</a>]:<ul><li>Flurbiprofen was considered to be the most efficacious treatment, and aspirin the worst.</li><li>Tiaprofenic acid and mefenamic acid were indicated as the safest treatments, and indomethacin was most likely to cause mild gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort.</li><li>Naproxen was not significantly efficacious compared with other NSAIDs drugs and showed an average efficacy in ranking.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Licensed indications</strong><ul><li>Ibuprofen, naproxen, and flurbiprofen are licensed for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea. Tiaprofenic acid is licensed for the treatment of pain and inflammation in rheumatic disease and other musculoskeletal disorders in adults [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">BNF 76, 2018</a>]. </li><li>Mefenamic acid is also licensed for the treatment of dysmenorrhoea; however, there are concerns that it is more likely to cause seizures in overdose than other NSAIDs. It has a narrow therapeutic window, which increases the risk of accidental overdose [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">RDTC, 2014</a>]. The National Poisons Information Service considers an ingestion of 40 mg/kg or more to be potentially toxic [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">NPIS, 2013</a>]. This means that a woman who weighs 50 kg would only need to ingest one extra dose of 500 mg of mefenamic acid in 24 hours (total of 2000 mg) to be considered to be at risk of toxicity.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Paracetamol</h5><ul><li>Evidence from the Cochrane systematic review showed that NSAIDs appeared to be more effective than paracetamol in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">Marjoribanks, 2015</a>]. However, paracetamol is a well-tolerated analgesic and is a widely used alternative to NSAIDs for musculoskeletal pain.</li></ul><h5>Hormonal contraception</h5><ul><li>There is evidence that dysmenorrhea improves with the use of oral contraceptives.<ul><li><strong>Combined oral contraceptives (COCs)</strong><ul><li>A Cochrane systematic review (search date February 2008) found limited evidence that COCs are effective for relieving pain associated with primary dysmenorrhoea. However, the overall quality of the trials was poor, some trials were over 25 years old, and some used COCs with higher doses of oestrogen than is present in currently available products [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">Wong et al, 2009</a>].</li><li>Despite the limited trial evidence, COCs are widely recommended by experts for this indication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">Proctor and Farquhar, 2006</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">Harel, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">RCOG, 2012</a>], and the added contraceptive advantage make them a suitable first-line option for some women. </li><li>COCs containing 20 micrograms of ethinylestradiol are less preferred because they are more likely to cause unscheduled bleeding. See the section on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/contraception-combined-hormonal-methods/management/combined-oral-contraceptive/\">Combined oral contraceptive</a> in the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/contraception-combined-hormonal-methods/\">Contraception - combined hormonal methods</a> for more information.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Oral progestogen-only contraceptives</strong><ul><li>An observational study (n = 406) assessed the effects of desogestrel 75 micrograms (Cerazette<sup>®</sup>) in women with dysmenorrhoea and found that dysmenorrhoea resolved or considerably improved in 93% of the study population [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">Ahrendt et al, 2007</a>].</li></ul></li><li><strong>Parenteral progestogens</strong><ul><li>A review of open-label, non-comparative and comparative studies (n = 923) assessed the effects of etonogestrel subdermal implant (Implanon<sup>®</sup>, which is bioequivalent to Nexplanon<sup>®</sup>) on menstrual bleeding patterns and found that it reduced both the incidence and severity of dysmenorrhoea. Most women (77%) who had baseline dysmenorrhoea experienced complete resolution of symptoms [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">Mansour et al, 2008</a>]. </li><li>Some experts recommend that parenteral progestogens (such as depot medroxyprogesterone acetate) may be considered in the treatment of dysmenorrhea [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">Proctor and Farquhar, 2006</a>]. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate works primarily by suppressing ovulation; it can also induce endometrial atrophy. One of its benefits is amenorrhea with a resultant reduction in the incidence of dysmenorrhea.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Intrauterine contraception</strong><ul><li>A longitudinal population study assessed the prevalence and severity of dysmenorrhea in women using an intrauterine contraception and found that the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS, Mirena<sup>®</sup>) was associated with reduced dysmenorrhea severity compared with other methods of contraception (barrier methods, natural family planning, coitus interruptus, and sterilization) or no method of contraception. The copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) did not reduce the severity of dysmenorrhea when compared with other methods of contraception [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">Lindh and Milsom, 2013</a>].</li><li>The RCOG guideline states that<em> </em>that non endometriosis-related cyclical pain also appears to be well controlled by the LNG-IUS [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">RCOG, 2012</a>], and previous expert reviewers of this CKS topic agree that the LNG-IUS is an option for women with dysmenorrhoea who require contraception. It is also an option for those who do not require contraception, particularly older women who have had children and women with heavy menstrual bleeding.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) guideline <em>The initial management of chronic pelvic pain </em>recommends that<em> </em>women with cyclical pain are offered a therapeutic trial using hormonal treatment for a period of 3–6 months [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">RCOG, 2012</a>].</li></ul><h5>Non-drug measures to reduce pain</h5><ul><li><strong>Heat therapy and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) </strong><ul><li>A systematic review assessed the effectiveness of heat therapy and TENS interventions for pain relief and quality of life improvement in women with primary dysmenorrhea [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">Igwea, 2016</a>].<ul><li>Evidence from trials on heat therapy (n = 242) showed individual improvement in pain levels.</li><li>Evidence from trials on TENS (n = 247) showed relatively positive effects in pain reduction. Overall, the evidence suggested that conventional TENS is a better option in dysmenorrheal pain relief than other forms of TENS (such as acupuncture-like TENS, and OVA TENS) and that high-frequency TENS is more effective for pain relief, although there was insufficient to determine the effectiveness of low frequency TENS in reducing dysmenorrhea.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Other non-drug measures</strong><ul><li>There is a lack of good-quality evidence to support the use of herbal remedies, dietary supplements, acupuncture, acupressure, spinal manipulation, behavioural therapy, and exercise to treat dysmenorrhoea [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">Khan et al, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">Pattanittum, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">Smith, 2016</a>]. In addition, herbal remedies have the potential to cause adverse effects and may interact with other medicines.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>R</strong><strong>eferral </strong></p><ul><li>The recommendation to refer if symptoms are severe and do not responded to initial treatment within 3–6 months is extrapolated from the RCOG guideline, which recommends that women with cyclical pain should be offered a therapeutic trial of hormonal treatment for a period of 3–6 months before having a diagnostic laparoscopy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/dysmenorrhoea/references/\">RCOG, 2012</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to refer if there is doubt about the diagnosis is based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><!-- end field 4d6a4254-6b49-4202-b976-7df2812f4366 --><!-- end item c12a5d0e-2aaf-4ae0-bac4-e893a8b7df00 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
