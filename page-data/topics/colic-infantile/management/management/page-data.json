Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guideline <em>Postnatal care: Routine postnatal care of women and their babies</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">NICE, 2015</a>], two Cochrane systematic reviews <em>Manipulative therapies for infantile colic (Review)</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference

internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">Biagioli, 2016</a>], two further systematic reviews of treatments for infantile colic [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">Hall, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">Lucassen, 2015</a>], and expert opinion in review articles on the management of infantile colic [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">DTB, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">Waddell, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\"

class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">Vandenplas, 2015a</a>].</p><h5>Providing reassurance, sources of information, and self-help strategies</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on providing reassurance, accessing peer support, and holding the baby through the crying episode are based on expert opinion in the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">NICE, 2015</a>].</li><li>The recommendations on possible soothing strategies and behavioural modification of the parent-infant interaction are based on expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">DTB, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">McKenzie, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">Waddell, 2013</a>].<ul><li>Expert opinion in a review article notes that providing effective coping strategies and methods to soothe the infant are essential to reduce parental stress and anxiety [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">DTB, 2013</a>].</li><li>Behavioural modification may reduce colic symptoms, possibly by increasing maternal responsiveness and time spent with the infant [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">DTB, 2013</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Advice on continuing breastfeeding</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on a systematic review of multiple treatments for infantile colic [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">Lucassen, 2015</a>], expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">Akhnikh, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">Vandenplas, 2015a</a>], and the fact that there is no known association between feeding method and the development of infantile colic [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">DTB, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h5>Treatments not recommended</h5><ul><li>A systematic review of hydrolyzed, low-lactose, or soya-based milk preparations, hypoallergenic diet for breastfeeding mothers, cranial osteopathy and spinal manipulation, and probiotics found insufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to recommend their use, as they are of unknown clinical effectiveness [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">Lucassen, 2015</a>]. This is supported by low-quality evidence in two Cochrane systematic reviews [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">Dobson, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">Biagioli, 2016</a>] and by expert opinion in a review article which concludes there is little evidence to support the use of simeticone, lactase drops, and probiotics, and insufficient evidence to recommend complementary therapies such as herbal supplements and spinal manipulation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">DTB, 2013</a>].<ul><li>Expert opinion in a review article states that there is inconsistent and conflicting evidence on the benefits of lactase drops for the treatment of infantile colic [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">DTB, 2013</a>], and this is supported by a systematic review of medical therapies for infantile colic which found no evidence for benefit of the use of lactase drops [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">Hall, 2012</a>].</li><li>Simeticone is theorized to reduce intraluminal gas in the infant gut, however a systematic review of two RCTs found conflicting results and no difference in the reduction of colic episodes compared with placebo [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">Hall, 2012</a>]. This is supported by low-quality evidence in a Cochrane systematic review of three small studies comparing simeticone with placebo (one RCT and one meta-analysis of two cross-over studies). It found no difference in the reported duration of crying between the treatment and placebo groups, and the studies were at high risk of bias [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">Biagioli, 2016</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article states that any maternal diet modification may result in improving symptoms of colic secondary to undiagnosed cows' milk protein allergy in the infant, rather than infantile colic with no underlying cause [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">DTB, 2013</a>].</li><li>There is inconsistent and conflicting evidence on the use of probiotics for the treatment of infantile colic [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">Johnson, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">Vandenplas, 2015a</a>]. A systematic review of five RCTs assessing probiotics in mainly breastfed infants found those receiving probiotics had a reduced crying time compared with controls, however it noted several possible confounders, two studies had an unclear or high risk of bias, and the results could not be extrapolated to predominantly formula-fed infants [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">Schreck Bird, 2016</a>].</li><li>A Cochrane systematic review of pain-relieving agents for infantile colic found insufficient evidence to recommend herbal supplements as a treatment option [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">Biagioli, 2016</a>]. In addition, expert opinion in a review article states that the use of herbal supplements has been associated with adverse effects such as vomiting, sleepiness, and constipation in the infant [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">DTB, 2013</a>].</li><li>A Cochrane systematic review found insufficient evidence to support the use of spinal manipulation or cranial osteopathy, as the studies included were small, non-blinded, and at high risk of bias [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/colic-infantile/references/\">Dobson, 2012</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Seeking specialist advice or arranging referral to a paediatrician</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on when to seek specialist advice or arrange referral are pragmatic based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><!-- end field bd7a609c-564c-4c63-9474-20ab6035d0bf --><!-- end item ba2a4dd0-7dcc-4560-822a-a231cdcaba12 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
