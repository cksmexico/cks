Consequently, this leaves little time for healthcare professionals to 'wait and see' if clinical features are evolving.</li></ul></li><li>A retrospective study of 448 children on the course of illness before admission to hospital with meningococcal disease found that half of children presenting to GPs were sent home on their first visit [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/meningitis-bacterial-meningitis-meningococcal-disease/references/\">Thompson, 2006</a>].</li><li>The diagnosis of meningococcal disease can only be confirmed in secondary care. The definitive test for meningitis is a lumbar puncture with laboratory examination of the cerebrospinal fluid [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/meningitis-bacterial-meningitis-meningococcal-disease/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>]. </li></ul><h4>Signs and symptoms</h4><ul><li>The information on signs and symptoms of meningitis is based on the NICE guideline<em> </em>and has been extrapolated to include adults [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/meningitis-bacterial-meningitis-meningococcal-disease/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>].</li><li>In general the younger the person, the more atypical the symptoms [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/meningitis-bacterial-meningitis-meningococcal-disease/references/\">van de Beek, 2016</a>]:<ul><li>Headache, fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status are common signs and symptoms in adults. However, the triad of fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status is reported in only 41–51% of people, and petechial rash is identified in 20–52% of people and is indicative of meningococcal infection in over 90% of cases.</li><li>Fever, altered mental status, and neck stiffness are less frequently present in younger infants than in older children and adults. Typically childhood bacterial meningitis begins with fever, chills, vomiting, photophobia, and severe headache.</li><li>Neonates with bacterial meningitis often present with non-specific symptoms such as irritability, poor feeding, respiratory distress, pale or marble skin, and hyper- or hypotonia. Fever is present in a minority (6–39%) of cases and seizures are reported in 9–34% of cases. </li></ul></li><li><em>The UK joint specialist societies guideline on the diagnosis and management of acute meningitis and meningococcal sepsis in immunocompetent adults</em> advises that rash is more likely to present with meningococcal meningitis than with pneumococcal meningitis and that Kernig’s sign and Brudzinski’s sign should not be relied upon for diagnosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/meningitis-bacterial-meningitis-meningococcal-disease/references/\">McGill, 2016a</a>]. </li></ul><!-- end field eec35fa2-e731-4cd3-abdb-bb36a594508c --><!-- end item a7d601aa-b059-4dc8-b9d6-cbc9ec02ed70 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
