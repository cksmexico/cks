However, the need for admission for parenteral treatment, observation, further investigation, and/or possible surgical intervention should be considered in certain situations [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pelvic-inflammatory-disease/references/\">Ross, 2017</a>]. For example:<ul><li>Pregnant women with PID should be admitted to hospital, as intravenous antibiotics are required due to the increased risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and pre-term delivery [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pelvic-inflammatory-disease/references/\">BASHH, 2018</a>]. </li><li>Women with HIV may experience more severe symptoms of PID, so HIV positive women with severe PID should be admitted to hospital [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pelvic-inflammatory-disease/references/\">BASHH, 2018</a>]. </li><li>Expert opinion in the BASHH guideline is that although laparoscopic division of adhesions is sometimes performed in women with Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome, there is insufficient trial evidence to make any recommendations other than giving the usual treatment for PID [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pelvic-inflammatory-disease/references/\">BASHH, 2018</a>]. CKS therefore recommends seeking specialist advice if peri-hepatitis is suspected.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Importance of prompt treatment</h5><ul><li>It is likely that delaying treatment increases the risk of the PID becoming worse, as well as the risk of long-term complications (such as ectopic pregnancy, subfertility, or chronic pelvic pain) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pelvic-inflammatory-disease/references/\">Ross, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pelvic-inflammatory-disease/references/\">BASHH, 2018</a>].</li><li>BASHH advises that there should be a low threshold for commencing an empirical antibiotic (before the results of tests are available) because of the risk of serious complications if treatment is delayed. This is particularly important in women younger than 25 years of age because there is a higher incidence of PID in this age group<em> </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pelvic-inflammatory-disease/references/\">BASHH, 2018</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Managing women with HIV</h5><ul><li>Women with HIV may experience more severe symptoms of PID but will usually respond to the standard antibiotic regimens. No change in treatment from that recommended for women without HIV infection is required<em> </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pelvic-inflammatory-disease/references/\">BASHH, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Removal of intrauterine contraception (IUC)</h5><ul><li>Evidence on whether or not to remove IUC in a woman who has PID is limited and conflicting. <ul><li>BASHH recommends that<em> </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pelvic-inflammatory-disease/references/\">BASHH, 2018</a>]:<ul><li>In women with mild to moderate PID, the IUC may be left in situ. However, a review should be performed after 48–72 hours and the device removed if significant clinical improvement has not occurred.</li><li>The need for emergency hormonal contraception following removal of the IUC should always be considered. </li></ul></li><li>The European guideline on PID recommends that [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pelvic-inflammatory-disease/references/\">Ross, 2017</a>]:<ul><li>Removal of the IUC should be considered, based on evidence from a single randomized controlled trial that suggested removal may be associated with better short-term improvement in symptoms and signs. However, a subsequent systematic review concluded that there is little difference in outcomes for women with mild-to-moderate PID who retain their IUC in situ during treatment.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h5>Presence of actinomyces-like organisms (ALOs)</h5><ul><li>The role of ALOs in infection in women using IUC is unclear. <em>Actinomyces israelii </em>is a commensal organism in the female genital tract and although these organisms may be found on cervical smears or swabs, their presence is not diagnostic or predictive of disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pelvic-inflammatory-disease/references/\">FSRH, 2015</a>].</li><li>The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) advises that [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pelvic-inflammatory-disease/references/\">FSRH, 2015</a>]:<ul><li>Insertion or reinsertion of an IUC can be carried out in asymptomatic women with ALOs.</li><li>There is no need to remove IUC in asymptomatic women with ALOs.</li><li>If a woman with PID wishes to continue using an IUC, there is no need for routine removal and appropriate antibiotic treatment can be initiated.</li><li>IUC removal is not routinely required in women with PID, but it should be removed if there is no response to treatment (approximately 72 hours).</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 5815901d-d861-4d7b-b630-d7d63da4e5fb --><!-- end item 1c6cdf73-bc8f-421a-a608-ea71a1193e20 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"f56c5583-5ed1-565d-bda6-bbad93e75d2b","slug":"antibiotic-treatment","fullItemName":"Antibiotic treatment","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field f2253cd2-b41c-41dc-81c7-f877bd3a3098 --><h3>Which antibiotics should I prescribe for the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease? </h3><!-- end field f2253cd2-b41c-41dc-81c7-f877bd3a3098 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 59b6a3bb-10f1-491c-8c45-ae349144adaa --><!-- begin field 4a6a5b27-2e39-4284-a7db-621a5ff1e2af --><ul><li><strong>If the risk of gonococcal infection is low:</strong><ul><li><strong>Prescribe any of the following first-line regimens </strong>(taking into account factors such as the age of the person, contraindications and cautions, possible adverse effects, and local antimicrobial sensitivity patterns):<ul><li>Ceftriaxone 1 g as a single intramuscular (IM) dose, followed by oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily <em>plus </em>oral metronidazole 400 mg twice daily for 14 days.</li><li>Oral ofloxacin 400 mg twice daily <em>plus </em>oral metronidazole 400 mg twice daily for 14 days.
