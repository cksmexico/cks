The manufacturer advises that it must not be used in pregnant women due to the experimental risk of damage by quinolones to the weight-bearing cartilage of immature animals.</li><li>Pregnant women — the manufacturer advises against the use of moxifloxacin in pregnant women due to the experimental risk of damage to the weight-bearing cartilage of immature animals and reversible joint injuries described in children receiving some quinolones. The safety of moxifloxacin in human pregnancy has not been evaluated, although animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity. </li><li>Breastfeeding women — the manufacturer advises that moxifloxacin must not be used during breast feeding due to the absence of human data and the experimental risk of damage to the weight-bearing cartilage of immature animals. Pre-clinical data indicate that small amounts of moxifloxacin are secreted in milk.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Use moxifloxacin with caution in people with:</strong><ul><li>Renal impairment — elderly people with renal disorders should use moxifloxacin with caution if they are unable to maintain adequate fluid intake, because dehydration may increase the risk of renal failure.</li><li>History of epilepsy or conditions that predispose to seizures — quinolones may lower the seizure threshold and may trigger seizures.</li><li>Myasthenia gravis — may exacerbate muscle weakness in people with myasthenia gravis.</li><li>G6PD deficiency — people with latent or diagnosed glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency may be predisposed to haemolytic reactions if they are treated with quinolones. If mofloxacin is absolutely necessary, potential occurrence of haemolysis should be monitored.</li><li>History of psychotic disorder or psychiatric disease —<strong> </strong>psychotic reactions have been reported in people receiving quinolones, including moxifloxacin. In very rare cases depression or psychotic reactions have progressed to suicidal thoughts and self-injurious behaviour, such as suicide attempts.</li><li>Diabetes mellitus — disturbances in blood glucose, including both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, have been reported, usually in people with diabetes receiving concurrent treatment with an oral hypoglycaemic drug or with insulin. Cases of hypoglycaemic coma have also been reported. Careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pelvic-inflammatory-disease/references/\">ABPI, 2018b</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pelvic-inflammatory-disease/references/\">BNF 75, 2018</a>]</p><!-- end field b09b443f-7070-4a57-84c2-a94800d84254 --><!-- end item 08bfc0dd-90bd-4a29-b817-a94800d83eb4 -->","subChapters":[]},{"id":"e3c1c676-e5c5-5a97-a091-58163e6c29bc","slug":"adverse-effects","fullItemName":"Adverse effects","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field e0ddc3aa-f89b-4531-947d-a94800e189f7 --><h3>What are the adverse effects?</h3><!-- end field e0ddc3aa-f89b-4531-947d-a94800e189f7 -->","summary":"","htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 6e7b5e30-7fe2-4689-8874-a94800e188bd --><!-- begin field 434296c6-4c13-42b2-9848-a94800e189f7 --><ul><li><strong>Convulsions</strong> — the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) has warned that quinolones may induce convulsions in people with or without a history of convulsions.
