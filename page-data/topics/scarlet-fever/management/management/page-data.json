It also highlights that most cases of scarlet fever become non-infectious within 24 hours of taking antibiotics, and recommends the three choices of antibiotics specified [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">PHE, 2017</a>].</li><li>The PHE publication on seasonal data notes that early treatment of scarlet fever is vital, especially given the potential for complications associated with Group A streptococcal (GAS) infections [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">PHE, 2020</a>].</li><li>This approach is supported by expert opinion in review articles that recommend antibiotics are prescribed regardless of severity of illness to reduce the duration of symptoms and speed recovery, to reduce the risk of onward transmission, and to reduce the risk of complications [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">Basetti, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">DTB, 2018</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article recommends the use of penicillin first-line as it has a narrow spectrum of action and known efficacy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">Holden, 2015</a>]. This is supported by additional expert opinion that highlights evidence of clinical efficacy, safety record, and the low cost of penicillin [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">Basetti, 2017</a>].</li><li>The option of prescribing amoxicillin in place of penicillin four times a day if compliance with penicillin is an issue is based on expert opinion in a review article. It also notes that azithromycin has a longer half-life and sustained intracellular concentration compared with alternative treatments such as penicillin, and therefore a shorter course of 5 days is effective against streptococcal pharyngitis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">Holden, 2015</a>].</li><li>The information that the use of azithromycin for treatment of scarlet fever is off-label is based on the PHE publication on outbreaks [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">PHE, 2017</a>] and expert opinion in the British National Formulary (BNF) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">Joint Formulary Committee, 2020</a>].</li></ul><h5>Notifying the local health protection team</h5><ul><li>The PHE publication on outbreaks notes that registered Medical Practitioners have a legal requirement to notify all suspected cases of scarlet fever (and iGAS infection) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">PHE, 2017</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article notes that cases of iGAS infection should also be notified urgently, so that close contacts can be identified early and advised to be vigilant for symptoms of GAS infection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">DTB, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>Advising on appropriate self-care measures</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on the use of antipyretics for symptom relief and fluid replacement are based on a PHE patient leaflet [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">PHE, 2019a</a>] and expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">Basetti, 2017</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to clean and cover any skin break is based on the fact that breaching the skin barrier provides a portal of entry for Group A streptococcal infection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">PHE, 2017</a>].</li></ul><h5>Advising on measures to reduce the risk of cross-infection</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to avoid work, school, or other childcare settings for 24 hours after starting antibiotics is based on the fact that antibiotics minimize the risk of complications and onward transmission, as treated people are typically non-infectious after 24 hours [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">PHE, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">PHE, 2019b</a>].

This approach is supported by the expert opinion of previous external reviewers of this CKS topic.</li></ul><h5>Seeking local health protection team advice</h5><ul><li>The information that antibiotic prophylaxis may be necessary for people at high risk of complications is based on the fact chemoprophylaxis can eradicate GAS carriage in those who may be at risk of infection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">PHE, 2017</a>].</li><li>The recommendation that close contacts at risk of iGAS should seek medical advice if they develop symptoms is extrapolated from expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">Wong, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">Holden, 2015</a>]. This is supported by the PHE publication on seasonal data that advises maintaining a high index of suspicion in relevant people, as early recognition and prompt initiation of specific and supportive therapy for people with iGAS infection can be life saving [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">PHE, 2020</a>].<ul><li>This is supported by a retrospective cohort study that compared the incidence of iGAS infection among household contacts of people with scarlet fever, with the background incidence of iGAS infection in England. It recorded the 60-day incidence rate of iGAS in household contacts of people with scarlet fever (n = 73,344) diagnosed with or without laboratory confirmation of GAS infection, and found the absolute risk was low, but was 12.2-fold higher than the background rate. It concluded that clinicians should have increasing awareness of the risk for iGAS in scarlet fever contacts when assessing people, to improve early identification and treatment of cases [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">Watts, 2019</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The information that routine testing of asymptomatic household contacts is not needed is based on the limited efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis and potential risks associated with antibiotic use, including adverse effects and promotion of resistance [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/scarlet-fever/references/\">PHE, 2017</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field 7072b77f-d5a4-4368-8e55-de90185972e4 --><!-- end item e837a605-c2f0-4046-b34e-5003c62089b5 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
