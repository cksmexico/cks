overall risk of contracting infectious diseases from abroad is very low if precautions are taken.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Routine vaccinations should be up to date, </strong>as many of these are required for overseas travel.</li><li><strong>Advise that the risk of contracting an infectious disease abroad depends upon:</strong><ul><li>The region visited — the risk may vary from country to country, and prevalence may vary within countries.</li><li>The length of stay — the longer the stay, the greater the risk of exposure.</li><li>The time of stay — some diseases are more prevalent at certain times of the year (e.g. the rainy season).</li><li>The type of holiday or work — in general, people are more at risk in rural areas than in urbanized or developed areas. Hence backpacking may be more dangerous than a package holiday, and work in rural or wild areas is often particularly high risk.</li><li>The age and health of the traveller — some people may be more susceptible to infections.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Advise that the most common infectious diseases contracted abroad <em>cannot </em>effectively be prevented by vaccination.</strong><ul><li>Travellers' diarrhoea may occur in up to 50% of visitors abroad and can generally be prevented by avoiding contaminated food and drink.

See the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/malaria-prophylaxis/\">Malaria prophylaxis</a> for more information.</li><li>Zika virus is spread by day-biting mosquitos, is present in Africa, Asia, the Pacific Islands, Central and South America and the Caribbean, and can pose a risk to a developing baby if contracted during pregnancy. The risk of Zika virus can be reduced by using insect bite avoidance measures.

Some areas, such as Thailand, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Indian subcontinent, are endemic with HIV. </li><li>Parasitic infestation (such as onchocerciasis, loiasis, schistosomiasis) may present long after the person has returned. Schistosomiasis may also present acutely a few weeks or months after exposure, but presentation can be delayed for much longer.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Inform the person that health provision in developing countries may be inadequate or difficult to access.
