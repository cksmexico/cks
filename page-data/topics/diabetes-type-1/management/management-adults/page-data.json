The basis for the NICE recommendations have been briefly summarized in this section. For detailed information on the evidence NICE used to make these recommendations, see the <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng17/evidence/full-guideline-pdf-435400241\" data-hyperlink-id=\"0da19505-b35e-4c8a-9c90-a93100987082\">full NICE guideline</a>.</p><h5>Individual care plan</h5><ul><li>In the expert opinion of the NICE guideline development group (GDG), the time following diagnosis with type 1 diabetes is one of great stress for many people and management decisions taken at this time may have a long-term impact on the person. In order to be effective, these decisions need an assessment of medical and lifestyle factors that can be expected to affect various areas of diabetes management, including choice of treatment, monitoring requirements, and educational requirements.</li></ul><h5>Offering a structured education programme</h5><ul><li>The NICE GDG was aware that in people with chronic diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, education programmes have been shown to improve knowledge and disease management. <ul><li>The GDG searched for randomized trials comparing structured educational programmes with other educational programmes or usual care/no treatment in adults with type 1 diabetes. <ul><li>Overall, they were interested in HbA1c as an objective measure of continuing glucose control, and improvements in quality of life. Other outcomes considered were hypoglycaemia, hospital admissions, hypoglycaemia unawareness, adverse events, knowledge, and adherence to treatment.</li><li>Low- to very low-quality evidence showed a benefit for structured educational programmes compared with other educational programmes or usual care/no treatment.</li><li>Although the results across the range of educational programmes studied were not as positive as expected, the results of the DAFNE (dose-adjustment for normal eating) programme were superior to others. Since DAFNE is already widely used in the UK, it was considered to be the educational programme of choice.</li></ul></li><li>The GDG debated whether their recommendation should specify that DAFNE alone should be used. <ul><li>Considering that there are other educational programmes that appear to be useful but have not been formally studied, the GDG decided that they should stipulate that structured educational programmes had to fulfil the criteria of the <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs6/chapter/Quality-statement-3-Structured-education-programmes-for-adults-with-type-1-diabetes\" data-hyperlink-id=\"055d5a1d-6a1d-42a5-ac14-a9310098713d\">NICE quality standards</a>.</li></ul></li><li>The GDG also discussed how soon after diagnosis the programme should be offered.<ul><li>It was agreed that the programme should be undertaken when the person with diabetes feels ready to engage fully, but the consensus was that for most people it would be worthwhile enrolling in DAFNE (or a similar programme) from a time point of 6–12 months after diagnosis since the first few months post-diagnosis are a period of considerable adjustment. The GDG thought that trying intensive education at this stage would be less worthwhile and even counterproductive. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h5>Providing information on government disability benefits</h5><ul><li>CKS has extrapolated this recommendation from the NICE guideline <em>Diabetes (type 1 and type 2) in children and young people: diagnosis and management </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">NICE, 2015b</a>] as the information is also relevant to adults with type 1 diabetes and their family/carers.</li></ul><h5>Managing lifestyle issues</h5><ul><li>See the section on <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/management/management-adults/#lifestyle-management\">Lifestyle management</a> for more information.</li></ul><h5>Providing information on support groups</h5><ul><li>In the expert opinion of the NICE GDG, having type 1 diabetes can have a major impact on lifestyle and self-esteem and it would appear that support groups could have a role in providing for some needs outside the professional environment and even separately from immediate carers.</li><li>The NICE GDG reviewed the Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs (DAWN) questionnaire study, which highlighted that emotional support, along with family support, was a key factor in how well people with diabetes manage their condition. Support networks were considered at least as important as pharmacological treatment. </li><li>There is also some evidence that people who do not have access to a community of support, especially the young or elderly living alone, may be less likely to be compliant with their treatment regimen, thereby putting them at risk of inadequate control of their diabetes.</li></ul><!-- end field f4bf037d-2bc9-4cdd-ad72-692e0c2b045e --><!-- end item f4df430e-8427-4e4a-9653-8e76b6d3bfee -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"54e5cb94-2bf4-5beb-bfa2-3aa03d5a0b0a","slug":"insulin-therapy","fullItemName":"Insulin therapy","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field ea161e5b-97fd-42d1-ac51-b4417778b82d --><h3>Insulin therapy for adults with type 1 diabetes</h3><!-- end field ea161e5b-97fd-42d1-ac51-b4417778b82d -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 4cfb7aa8-e46d-4760-944f-a5fba483b606 --><!-- begin field 63e80eb6-2c76-469b-92be-f640b908c7d7 --><ul><li><strong>Insulin therapy should only be initiated and managed by healthcare professionals with the relevant expertise and training. </strong></li><li>See the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/insulin-therapy-in-type-1-diabetes/\">Insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes</a> for detailed information on insulin therapy, including available insulin preparations, recommended regimens, information on injection technique and injection sites, storage of insulin, adverse effects, safety issues, and general information on lifestyle and cultural aspects of insulin treatment (such as driving whilst on insulin treatment, fasting, shift work, holiday and travel, and insurance).</li></ul><!-- end field 63e80eb6-2c76-469b-92be-f640b908c7d7 --><!-- end item 4cfb7aa8-e46d-4760-944f-a5fba483b606 -->","subChapters":[]},{"id":"1f3c430c-5710-5eb9-a191-899b79b9f143","slug":"target-hba1c","fullItemName":"Target HbA1c","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 9d74ef4a-c433-4e7d-b98b-237b130e098f --><h3>What is the target HbA1c for adults with type 1 diabetes?</h3><!-- end field 9d74ef4a-c433-4e7d-b98b-237b130e098f -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item cb8ecde8-7585-418c-b14c-e98df146a4b6 --><!-- begin field b6edb85e-4303-4cc5-8acd-81ac78f76f6a --><ul><li><strong>Support adults with type 1 diabetes to aim for a target HbA1c level of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) or lower, to minimize the risk of long-term vascular <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/background-information/complications/\">complications</a>.</strong><ul><li>For people with type 1 diabetes and chronic kidney disease not treated with dialysis, aim for a target HbA1C of less than 6.5% to less than 8%.   </li><li>Agree an individualized HbA1c target with the person, taking into account factors such as their daily activities, aspirations, likelihood of complications, comorbidities, occupation, and history of hypoglycaemia (blood glucose levels less than 3.5 mmol/L).</li><li>Ensure that aiming for an HbA1c target is not accompanied by problematic hypoglycaemia.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Measure HbA1c levels every 3–6 months in most people. </strong><ul><li>Consider measuring HbA1c levels more often if the person's blood glucose control is suspected to be changing rapidly, for example if the HbA1c level has risen unexpectedly above a previously sustained target.</li><li>Inform the person of their results after each measurement, and ensure that their most recent result is available at the time of consultation.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field b6edb85e-4303-4cc5-8acd-81ac78f76f6a --><!-- end item cb8ecde8-7585-418c-b14c-e98df146a4b6 -->","subChapters":[{"id":"4bec3226-a25d-5564-ac0c-bc48eaa21b15","slug":"basis-for-recommendation-313","fullItemName":"Basis for recommendation","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field bc2f810d-6837-4326-89b2-e3d7086ec326 --><h4>Basis for recommendation</h4><!-- end field bc2f810d-6837-4326-89b2-e3d7086ec326 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 3130dcaf-7062-4414-9869-d4b172250b45 --><!-- begin field 697240f7-a423-4866-9999-bd7eec2f8ee1 --><p>These recommendations are largely based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline <em>Type 1 diabetes in adults: diagnosis and management </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">NICE, 2016d</a>].

By measuring HbA1c, healthcare professionals can get an overall picture of what a person's average blood glucose levels have been over 2–3 months. The higher the HbA1c, the greater the risk of developing diabetes-related complications [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">WHO, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">Diabetes.co.uk, 2019</a>].</p></li></ul><h5>Optimal HbA1c targets</h5><ul><li>Overall, low-quality evidence identified by NICE showed that lowering the HbA1c towards the non-diabetic range with intensified insulin therapy reduced the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications. However, it also showed that attainment of lower HbA1c levels was associated with a greater risk of severe hypoglycaemia (hypoglycaemia event requiring help from a third party for correction). NICE, therefore, advises that targets for blood glucose control should take into account the person's ability to achieve them without increasing the risk of severe hypoglycaemia.</li><li>In deciding on the optimum HbA1c targets for adults with type 1 diabetes, the NICE guideline development group (GDG) considered that people should achieve a target that minimized their risk of developing complications from glycaemia. Since retinopathy is often the first microvascular complication to develop from inadequate blood glucose control, the GDG paid particular attention to the risk of developing this complication at varying blood glucose levels as reported by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compared the outcomes of intensive therapy with conventional therapy in people with type 1 diabetes.</li><li>The GDG decided on an HbA1c target of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) on the grounds that a minimal risk of retinopathy was achieved at this level, with further improvements in HbA1c not achieving any further significant reduction in retinopathy risk. </li><li>The GDG recognized that such tight blood glucose control may not be desired by some people (for example people who drive for a living). In this case, an individualized HbA1c target should be agreed with the person.</li><li>The recommended HbA1c target range for people with diabetes and chronic kidney disease is based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) <em>Clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in chronic kidney disease</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">KDIGO, 2020</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Frequency of HbA1c measurement</h5><ul><li>Very low-quality evidence identified by NICE showed that a knowledge of HbA1c at clinic appointments led to improvements in clinical outcomes; however, no data were available on the optimal frequency of HbA1c monitoring.</li><li>Owing to the lack of evidence and the fact that patient members of the GDG expressed concern that increasing the frequency of HbA1c monitoring may result in difficulties making arrangements to attend appointments, especially if a visit to a healthcare professional was required for a blood test in the week before a clinic appointment, the NICE GDG decided to retain the previous recommendation of 3–6 monthly monitoring, advising that an increase in the frequency may be considered if necessary (for example if the person's treatment regimen is altered).</li></ul><!-- end field 697240f7-a423-4866-9999-bd7eec2f8ee1 --><!-- end item 3130dcaf-7062-4414-9869-d4b172250b45 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"a296edbb-2534-5837-872f-988879018ed2","slug":"self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose","fullItemName":"Self-monitoring of blood glucose","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 6f97c64f-3a2d-46b2-a3db-abe6013cb287 --><h3>What should I advise on self-monitoring of blood glucose?</h3><!-- end field 6f97c64f-3a2d-46b2-a3db-abe6013cb287 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 8ed21e75-67bd-4f7e-996e-abe6013cb21d --><!-- begin field 2d9164d9-6a59-462e-bdf7-abe6013cb287 --><ul><li><strong>Self-monitoring of blood glucose refers to home blood glucose testing for people with diabetes to determine the amount of glucose in the blood at any given time. </strong><ul><li>To self-monitor, the person would need a blood glucose monitor, lancets (which fit into a finger-pricking device), and testing strips (on which the blood is collected for testing in the machine).</li><li>See the section on <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/management/management-adults/#target-glucose-self-monitoring-levels\">Target glucose self-monitoring levels</a> for information on blood glucose self-monitoring target levels.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Self-monitoring skills should be taught at the time of diagnosis and at the time of initiation of insulin therapy, and should be reviewed at least annually. </strong>The review should include checking that the person knows:<ul><li>How to use their blood glucose monitoring meter — this can be done by asking them to demonstrate their technique.</li><li>When to test — for example before breakfast and 2 hours after meals, during periods of illness, before driving, and if they feel hypoglycaemic. </li><li>How to assess and respond to test results, including how to:<ul><li>Interpret trends in blood glucose levels as well as individual readings — this is important for adjusting insulin doses.</li><li>Identify the causes of high and low blood glucose values.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Continuous glucose monitoring is a way of measuring glucose levels continuously throughout the day and night via a tiny electrode inserted under the skin. </strong><ul><li>Continuous glucose monitoring systems provide continuous measurements (every 1–5 minutes) of glucose concentrations in the interstitial fluid, which correlate with blood glucose levels.

The basis for the NICE recommendations have been briefly summarized in this section. For detailed information on the evidence NICE used to make these recommendations, see the <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng17/evidence/full-guideline-pdf-435400241\" data-hyperlink-id=\"0da19505-b35e-4c8a-9c90-a93100987082\">full NICE guideline</a>.</p><h5>Routine self-monitoring of blood glucose</h5><ul><li>In the expert opinion of the NICE guideline development group (GDG), self-monitoring of blood glucose is central to the self-management of type 1 diabetes as strict blood glucose control has been shown to reduce the development and progression of long-term complications in people with diabetes.</li></ul><h5>Frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose</h5><ul><li>NICE identified evidence (from randomized controlled trials [RCTs], a large cross-sectional study, a large case-series, and a small cross-over clinical trial) which showed that:<ul><li>People who monitored blood glucose had improved glucose control compared with people who did not monitor blood glucose levels at all.</li><li>Increased blood glucose monitoring (up to 4 times a day) was associated with substantial improvements in blood glucose control.</li><li>Increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring (more than 4 times a day) was associated with further improvements in blood glucose control, with testing up to 10 times a day associated with an improvement in HbA1c. However, the increments in the clinical benefits gained were smaller with higher frequencies of blood glucose testing.</li><li>From the evidence for routine testing, the GDG did not consider a test frequency of more than 8 times a day to be associated with clinically significant further improvement in glucose control. The GDG advised that the indication for people wishing (or needing) to test at greater frequency should be discussed with the person and they should be supported if extra tests are needed to accommodate lifestyle issues.</li><li>The GDG also recognized that there would be times when people with type 1 diabates might want to test blood glucose levels more frequently, for example before exercise, during periods of illness, and when considering pregnancy, and advises that they should be encouraged to increase their frequency of testing to avoid adverse outcomes.</li><li>Overall, no adverse outcomes were reported from an increased frequency of blood glucose monitoring.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Optimal blood glucose targets</h5><ul><li>For pre-prandial targets: <ul><li>One RCT identified by NICE reported that nocturnal hypoglycaemia was unlikely to occur if people with type 1 diabetes achieved a plasma glucose level above 5.5 mmol/L on waking.</li><li>A second RCT reported that the risk of overnight hypoglycaemia was reduced if a waking plasma glucose level above 5 mmol/L was achieved.</li><li>The NICE GDG recognized that these recommendations were in line with recommendations from intensive education courses for type 1 diabetes and that targets for morning blood glucose levels on waking should be higher than other fasting values through the day in order to reduce the risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. </li><li>The GDG, therefore, recommends that in adults with type 1 diabetes, fasting plasma glucose targets should be 5–7 mmol/L on waking in the morning and 4–7 mmol/L at other times of day.</li></ul></li><li> For post-prandial glucose targets: <ul><li>One large RCT reported that the risk of complications from retinopathy were greatly reduced if a plasma glucose level of less than 8.1 mmol/L could be achieved after meals. </li><li>Therefore, the NICE GDG considered that people with type 1 diabetes should aim for a blood glucose level that was not above 9 mmol/L postprandially, whilst also avoiding hypoglycaemia (best avoided by keeping plasma glucose targets always above 4.5 mmol/L).</li></ul></li><li>The NICE GDG recommends that a bedtime target plasma glucose levels should be agreed with the person with type 1 diabetes. This should take into account the timing of the last meal and its related insulin dose, and be consistent with the recommended fasting level on waking. If the person experiences overnight hypoglycaemia whilst trying to achieve these targets, this suggests that their basal and/or prandial insulin doses should be reviewed rather than adjustment of target blood glucose levels.</li></ul><h5>Timing of self-monitoring of blood glucose</h5><ul><li>Although evidence identified by NICE showed that increased frequency of testing was associated with improved blood glucose control, it did not suggest an advantage in testing at specified times of day.</li><li>The NICE GDG noted that current clinical practice is to test blood glucose levels on waking, before meals, and before bed, as there is concern that testing blood glucose after meals might lead to over correction of blood glucose levels if they were found to be high (although there is no clinical evidence from an RCT to support this concern). </li><li>Based on this, the GDG recommends testing blood glucose levels 4 times a day, including before meals and before bed. </li><li>The GDG concluded that further research is required to ascertain the importance of testing after meals compared with testing before meals, but acknowledged that testing after meals may be useful for educational purposes (for example when learning to carbohydrate count) and may help people to ensure they are taking adequate amounts of insulin at meal times.</li><li>The GDG emphasized that structured education in interpreting blood glucose values (for example in relation to food, illness, and recent exercise) is essential to allow people to make informed decisions about insulin dose adjustment for improved blood glucose control.</li></ul><h5>Continuous glucose monitoring </h5><ul><li>Evidence identified by NICE does not support the routine use of continuous glucose monitoring. However, the NICE GDG recognized that it may be a suitable option in situations in which routine management fails to control episodes of hypoglycaemia despite efforts to optimize both monitoring and treatment. The GDG did not want their recommendations to remove the possibility of using continuous glucose monitoring in such cases and therefore agreed on recommendations that set out the situations in which a trial of continuous glucose monitoring might be warranted.</li><li>The definition of continuous glucose monitoring is taken from review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\"

The basis for the NICE recommendations have been briefly summarized in this section.

However, as there are currently no long-term trials assessing the impact of a low fat, low GI diet on the incidence of microvascular complications, the GDG concluded that further research is needed before this diet can be offered to people with type 1 diabetes.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Carbohydrate counting</strong><ul><li>Carbohydrates are the macronutrient with the greatest impact on blood glucose control, and it is well known that total carbohydrate (or glycaemic load) is the main predictor of the rise in blood glucose levels after meals.</li><li>Moderate, low, and very low-quality evidence identified by NICE (mainly from single studies) showed a clinical benefit of carbohydrate counting for HbA1c (change from baseline) at up to 6 months and over 6 months, and mild hypoglycaemia at over 6 months. However, low- and very low-quality evidence from single studies showed no clinical benefit of carbohydrate counting for HbA1c (final values) at over 6 months.</li><li>Low-quality evidence from a single observational study (case-series, before and after study) showed that compared with baseline, there were improvements in HbA1c after people used carbohydrate counting. </li></ul></li></ul><h5>Advice on exercise and physical activity</h5><ul><li>NICE reviewed the available evidence assessing the impact of exercise and physical activity on adults with type 1 diabetes. Although there was evidence for an improved arterial risk profile, evidence of a consistent effect in improving blood glucose control was absent. </li><li>However, given the fact that exercise and increased physical activity are usually recommended to the general population as part of a package of lifestyle measures to improve future health, in particular reduction of arterial risk (which is markedly elevated in people with type 1 diabetes), NICE recommends that appropriate information should be given to adults with type 1 diabetes who wish to integrate physical activity into a more healthy lifestyle.</li></ul><h5>Advice on alcohol intake</h5><ul><li>NICE recommends that adults with type 1 diabetes should be given appropriate information on the effects of alcohol on blood glucose control and exercise.</li><li>NICE does not make specific recommendations on what should be advised, so CKS has extrapolated recommendations from the NICE guideline <em>Diabetes (type 1 and type 2) in children and young people: diagnosis and management </em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">NICE, 2016e</a>] and from information on the Diabetes UK website (<a href=\"https://www.diabetes.org.uk/guide-to-diabetes/enjoy-food/what-to-drink-with-diabetes/alcohol-and-diabetes\" data-hyperlink-id=\"34be83a3-1ff2-4ea8-adf7-abc600857a1f\">www.diabetes.org.uk</a>).</li><li>The information on recommended alcohol units is taken from the <em>Alcohol Guidelines Review</em> published by the Department of Health [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">DH, 2016</a>].</li></ul><h5>Advice on smoking </h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the expert opinion of the NICE GDG.</li><li>The GDG noted that evidence identified in the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guideline<em> Management of diabetes.

The basis for the NICE recommendations have been briefly summarized in this section.

If body mass index (BMI) is over 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, central obesity can be assumed, and waist circumference does not need to be measured.</li><li>Raised triglycerides (or on specific treatment for this lipid abnormality).</li><li>Reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (or on specific treatment for this lipid abnormality).</li><li>Raised blood pressure (or on treatment for previously diagnosed hypertension).</li><li>Raised blood glucose.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h5>Antihypertensive treatment</h5><ul><li><strong>Treatment target</strong><ul><li>NICE identified two large multicentre trials included in a systematic review that showed an improvement in arterial and microvascular outcomes in people randomized to lower target blood pressures compared with those with less intensive blood pressure lowering.</li><li>NICE found evidence to support a diastolic blood pressure of less than 80 mmHg. No evidence on the appropriate target systolic blood pressure for people with type 1 diabetes was identified; however, the NICE GDG noted that consensus recommendations from the Canadian Hypertension Recommendations working group are that systolic blood pressure should be less than 130 mmHg [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">McAlister, 2002</a>].</li><li>The NICE guideline development group (GDG) pointed out that because the combination of raised blood pressure and nephropathy, or the presence of two or more features of the metabolic syndrome is known to be very high risk for premature CVD, intervention levels and targets should be lower and more strictly applied in this case than for a person with simple hypertension. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Antihypertensive drug choices</strong><ul><li>The NICE GDG did not review the evidence for the recommended antihypertensive drug treatments for people with type 1 diabetes, but were aware that several studies provide evidence for the safety and efficacy of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and low-dose thiazide diuretics in the treatment of hypertension in people with diabetes.</li><li>The GDG thought it was sensible to recommend a RAS blocker first line in people with type 1 diabetes, recognizing that:<ul><li>People younger than 55 years account for most adults with type 1 diabetes and hypertension.</li><li>Thiazide diuretics can raise blood glucose levels.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h5>Lipid modification</h5><ul><li>These recommendations are based on the NICE guideline <em>Cardiovascular disease: risk assessment and reduction, including lipid modification</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">NICE, 2016f</a>].</li><li>See the CKS topics on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/cvd-risk-assessment-management/\">CVD risk assessment and management</a> and <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/lipid-modification-cvd-prevention/\">Lipid modification - CVD prevention</a> for more information.</li></ul><h5>Antiplatelet treatment</h5><ul><li>Low-dose aspirin has been shown to reduce the incidence of CVD in people at high risk for other reasons, particularly if they have had a previous CVD event. However, because its use is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, it is only recommended for the secondary prevention of CVD [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">NICE, 2016d</a>].</li><li>Owing to the high risk of CVD in people with type 1 diabetes, NICE considered the available evidence to assess the effectiveness of antiplatelet treatment for the primary prevention of CVD in this group of people. The GDG was interested in balancing the prevalence of dyspepsia and gastrointestinal bleeding against any reduction in cardiovascular events. </li><li>Based on the available data, there was little robust evidence from the type 1 diabetes population to suggest either benefit or harm from antiplatelet treatment. </li><li>Based on the evidence and on information in the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) Drug Safety Update <em>Aspirin: not licensed for primary prevention of thrombotic vascular disease </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">MHRA, 2014a</a>], which suggests that the harms of aspirin for primary prevention outweigh the benefits, NICE does not recommend the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD in people with type 1 diabetes.</li></ul><!-- end field fd381c75-45cd-4d2c-a974-f8a48794c19a --><!-- end item 1a7263e6-d573-4e0d-8e06-132202f7be79 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"2775d7fe-1435-59c8-b5ef-fd5784c4a3ed","slug":"monitoring-for-complications","fullItemName":"Monitoring for complications","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 67d1cbbd-b515-4f18-90a0-4e17b36a469c --><h3>How should I monitor for complications in adults with type 1 diabetes?</h3><!-- end field 67d1cbbd-b515-4f18-90a0-4e17b36a469c -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 24596a5e-c2c1-428f-848d-109a8ab1412a --><!-- begin field 6336088a-300a-42ad-8d61-8e2f5c84c24a --><p><strong>People with type 1 diabetes should have regular surveillance for <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/background-information/complications/\">complications</a> of the disease. The reason for the surveillance as well as the significance of any abnormal findings should be discussed with the person and their family/carers. </strong></p><ul><li><strong>At every review appointment (if clinically indicated):</strong><ul><li>Measure HbA1c to ensure adequate blood glucose control.

Although none of the studies were specific to men with diabetes, the GDG accepted that it was possible to extrapolate findings from these studies to populations with diabetes. </li><li>The GDG was unable to make any recommendations on the use of testosterone and alprostadil for this indication owing to the lack of good-quality evidence.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Managing gastroparesis</strong><ul><li>NICE reviewed the available evidence to determine the impact of different interventions on the symptoms and clinical outcomes of gastroparesis<em> </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">NICE, 2016d</a>].<ul><li>Erythromycin increased gastric motility, but a significant reduction in symptom severity scores was not achieved in trials.</li><li>Metoclopramide reduced physical symptoms and vomiting. </li><li>Domperidone reduced physical symptoms and vomiting but had no effect on the psychological impact associated with gastroparesis.</li></ul></li><li>NICE noted the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) warning on the use of metoclopramide and domperidone, but considered that the risks associated with these treatments had to be weighed carefully against the risks and distress caused by uncontrolled chronic causes of vomiting, such as diabetic gastroparesis. <ul><li>Metoclopramide has well-known risks of neurological effects, such as short-term extrapyramidal disorders and tardive dyskinesia; therefore, it should be prescribed for short-term use only (up to 5 days) and at a maximum daily dose of 30 mg (usual dose of 10 mg up to three times a day) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">MHRA, 2014b</a>].</li><li>Domperidone is associated with a small increased risk of serious cardiac adverse effects (such as ventricular arrhythmias, QT interval prolongation, and sudden cardiac death), especially in people older than 60 years of age, people taking daily oral domperidone doses of more than 30 mg, and people taking QT-prolonging drugs (such as erythromycin) or cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors at the same time as domperidone [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">MHRA, 2014c</a>].</li></ul></li><li>NICE does not make any recommendations on the dose of prokinetic drug to be prescribed or the duration of treatment, but recommends an alternating treatment of erythromycin and metoclopramide.

However, they acknowledged that people with this condition subjectively report intense pain; therefore, clinical interventions aimed at reducing the intensity of the pain are warranted.</li><li>The GDG recommends simple analgesia first line, then treatment as described in the NICE guideline <em>Neuropathic pain - pharmacological management </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">NICE, 2019c</a>] if simple analgesics are ineffective. </li><li>The GDG warned about the risk of dependence with opioids and stressed that alternative treatments should be used, especially since there is no evidence that opioids are more effective than other therapeutic interventions in providing symptomatic relief for this condition.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h5>Foot care</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on foot care are based on the NICE guideline <em>Diabetic foot problems: prevention and management </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">NICE, 2019b</a>]. For detailed information on the evidence NICE used to make these recommendations, see the <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng19/evidence/full-guideline--august-2015-pdf-15672915543\" data-hyperlink-id=\"6ffe0b4b-f81e-4e51-8b4e-a931009895cc\">full NICE guideline</a> on diabetic foot problems.</li><li>The definition of Charcot arthropathy is taken from a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">Rogers, 2011</a>].</li></ul><h5>Being alert to the development of other autoimmune diseases</h5><ul><li>NICE advises that healthcare professionals should be alert to the development of other autoimmune diseases in people with type 1 diabetes<em> </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">NICE, 2016d</a>].<ul><li>The most common autoimmune conditions associated with type 1 diabetes are thyroid disease (Graves' disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis, 15–30%), autoimmune gastritis and/or pernicious anaemia (5–10%), coeliac disease (4–9%), vitiligo (2–10%), and Addison’s disease (0.5%) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">Van den Driessche, 2009</a>].</li><li>The NICE guideline on <em>Coeliac disease: recognition, assessment and management </em>states that people with type 1 diabetes should be offered serological testing for coeliac disease at diagnosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">NICE, 2015c</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 56a83ce5-46cd-4eef-9054-ef214b863adb --><!-- end item 6fad5025-8065-4bad-969b-edf99c280f38 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
