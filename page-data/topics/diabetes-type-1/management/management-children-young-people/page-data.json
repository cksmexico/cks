Therefore, a continuing programme of education should be offered from diagnosis.</li><li>Regarding an individualized approach, the NICE GDG noted that contact with families/carers of children and young people with type 1 diabetes supports the belief that people differ in their educational needs and learning styles.

href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">NICE, 2016e</a>]. The basis for the NICE recommendations have been briefly summarized in this section. For detailed information on the evidence NICE used to make these recommendations, see the <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng18/evidence/full-guideline-pdf-435396352\" data-hyperlink-id=\"a80a94c2-5ad3-4d5d-9aaa-a93100c4866c\">full NICE guideline</a>.</p><h5>Optimal blood glucose targets</h5><ul><li>NICE did not identify any evidence for inclusion in the 2015 diabetes guideline update review, but the guideline development group (GDG) agreed that tighter blood glucose control than recommended in the 2004 diabetes guideline (which was pre-prandial blood glucose level of 4–8 mmol/L and a post-prandial level of less than 10 mmol/L) would be beneficial.</li><li>There was a shared feeling within the group that it was beneficial to established tight control as early as possible (preferably from diagnosis), and the group felt that lower targets were particularly beneficial for children and young people with type 1 diabetes.</li><li>The GDG noted the importance of setting targets that the child or young person could live with and that if the targets set were too narrow then they would become difficult to comply with.</li><li>The GDG agreed that it was generally important to update the guidance for children and young people to be consistent with the guidance for adults. In certain circumstances, however, the targets should be slightly different, specifically with regard to the target range for fasting blood glucose.</li></ul><h5>Frequency and timing of self-monitoring of blood glucose</h5><ul><li>Overall, evidence identified by NICE showed an inverse correlation between the frequency of capillary blood glucose monitoring and HbA1c such that as frequency of capillary blood glucose monitoring increased then HbA1c improved. The quality of the evidence for this finding was low.</li><li>One study showed that a higher incidence of severe hypoglycaemic episodes was associated with more frequent capillary blood glucose monitoring. </li></ul><h5>Real-time continuous glucose monitoring</h5><ul><li>The NICE GDG acknowledged that the majority of the evidence identified in the review for continuous glucose monitoring compared with capillary blood glucose monitoring did not clearly support the use of one monitoring strategy over the other. The only prioritized outcome for which continuous glucose monitoring was found to be more beneficial than capillary blood glucose monitoring was parental satisfaction with the intervention.</li><li>Although the evidence was not particularly compelling, based on their experience the NICE GDG felt that continuous glucose monitoring enabled children and young people with type 1 diabetes and/or their family/carers to be more responsive to subtle changes in blood glucose concentrations and therefore this monitoring strategy was likely to produce clinical benefits in terms of glycaemic control in the certain children and young people with type 1 diabetes, for example those with frequent hypoglycaemia.</li><li>The GDG acknowledged that continuous glucose monitoring (real-time or otherwise) is generally more costly than capillary blood glucose monitoring. Nevertheless, the group felt that in light of the potential benefits to the specific subgroups of children and young people identified, the use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring would represent a cost-effective use of NHS resources. They also noted there may be some associated savings in terms of prevention of adverse effects from poor control and reduced need for capillary blood glucose testing strips (with continuous glucose monitoring, capillary blood testing is needed only for calibrating the continuous glucose monitoring device).</li><li>The definition of continuous glucose monitoring is taken from review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">Edelman, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">Ajjan, 2019</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field b083ec90-421d-4d2d-8feb-abe6014636f2 --><!-- end item c162948c-2d5d-4f79-86e7-abe6014636f2 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"a08c2cc6-7597-52ce-b403-cf8687d2d587","slug":"lifestyle-management","fullItemName":"Lifestyle management","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field f1954552-5dc6-4b62-a347-47807c455786 --><h3>How should I manage lifestyle issues in children and young people with type 1 diabetes?</h3><!-- end field f1954552-5dc6-4b62-a347-47807c455786 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item a3d7e5cf-d3bd-451b-845f-3566283e7e37 --><!-- begin field a082ddc1-842c-488f-996d-6180bfd7420a --><ul><li><strong>See the sections on <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/management/management-children-young-people/#diet\">Diet</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/management/management-children-young-people/#exercise-physical-activity\">Exercise</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/management/management-children-young-people/#alcohol-intake\">Alcohol</a>, and <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/management/management-children-young-people/#smoking-substance-misuse\">Smoking and substance misuse</a> for information on managing these lifestyle issues.</strong></li><li>Detailed information on managing other lifestyle and cultural issues, such as driving, fasting, holiday and travel, and shift work, are covered in the section on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/insulin-therapy-in-type-1-diabetes/management/insulin-therapy-type-1-diabetes/#lifestyle-cultural-issues\">Additional information and advice</a> in the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/insulin-therapy-in-type-1-diabetes/\">Insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes</a>.</li></ul><!-- end field a082ddc1-842c-488f-996d-6180bfd7420a --><!-- end item a3d7e5cf-d3bd-451b-845f-3566283e7e37 -->","subChapters":[{"id":"1973b912-3288-5e22-abb0-1afba25f6ac0","slug":"diet","fullItemName":"Diet","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field ade412df-9183-4131-8019-246cc573c553 --><h4>Advice on diet</h4><!-- end field ade412df-9183-4131-8019-246cc573c553 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item bb6e7b29-9b2f-460f-8ae5-d5599d86add9 --><!-- begin field f7b8494d-fecb-485e-825a-3b249359deff --><ul><li><strong>Support children and young people with type 1 diabetes and/or their family/carers</strong><strong> to develop a good working knowledge of nutrition and how it affects their diabetes. </strong><ul><li>Explain how healthy eating, including eating foods with a low glycaemic index (GI), at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, and appropriate types and amounts of fats, can reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).</li><li>Explain that a low GI diet may also help to improve blood glucose control and reduce the risk of hyperglycaemic episodes.</li><li>Support the child or young person and their family/carers to adjust their food choices accordingly, or consider referring them to a paediatric dietitian.<ul><li>Offer level 3 carbohydrate-counting education (carbohydrate counting with adjustment of insulin dosage according to an insulin:carbohydrate ratio) to children and young people who are using a multiple daily insulin injection regimen or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII or insulin pump) therapy.

The basis for the NICE recommendations have been briefly summarized in this section. For detailed information on the evidence NICE used to make these recommendations, see the <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng18/evidence/full-guideline-pdf-435396352\" data-hyperlink-id=\"a80a94c2-5ad3-4d5d-9aaa-a93100c4866c\">full NICE guideline</a>.</p><h5>Advice on diet</h5><ul><li>NICE based the general dietary recommendations for children and young people with type 1 diabetes on national and international guidelines on the management of diabetes in adults due to limited evidence and the lack of UK dietary guidelines on the optimal diet and nutritional requirements for children and young people with type 1 diabetes.</li><li>The guideline development group (GDG) agreed that if the use of a particular dietary regimen resulted in a reduction in HbA1c by near to (or greater than) 5.5 mmol/mol (0.5%), this would represent an important clinical benefit.</li><li>For low glycaemic index (GI) diets:<ul><li>The GDG was aware of a Cochrane systematic review that provided strong evidence of improved blood glucose control (reduction in HbA1c by 5.5 mmol/mol plus a reduction in hypoglycaemic episodes) in a mixed population that predominantly included adults with type 2 diabetes who were following a low GI diet. Based on physiological principles, the GDG believed that similar benefits would be expected in children and young people with type 1 diabetes.</li><li>Bearing in mind that a low GI diet could also potentially be an unhealthy one, as some low GI foods (such as pizza) are high in fat, the GDG recommended that appropriate nutritional advice should be given to the child or young person and/or their parents/carers.</li></ul></li><li>For carbohydrate counting:<ul><li>Trial evidence did not show improvements in HbA1c at 12 or 24 months that met the GDG's predefined threshold for a minimally important difference (5.5 mmol/mol [0.5%]) or caused a statistically significant improvement in HbA1c. However, there was a trend towards improvement with a mean difference of 0.3%, which was consistent with the group’s expectations.</li><li>Based on the clinical experience of the GDG and the fact that dietary advice based on carbohydrate counting combined with multiple daily injections more closely resembles normal physiological processes than diet and insulin regimens based on prescribed eating patterns, the GDG concluded that it was beneficial to offer level 3 carbohydrate counting to children and young people using multiple daily injections (insulin pump therapy).  </li><li>This conclusion was supported by the GDG's clinical consensus that a variation in carbohydrate intake of as little as 10 g could result in a measurable difference in blood glucose when using a fixed dose of insulin. </li></ul></li></ul><h5>Advice on alcohol intake</h5><ul><li>Although it is illegal for people under the age of 18 years to buy alcohol, the NICE GDG recognized that alcohol consumption in young people can be a problem.</li><li>NICE did not find any evidence investigating the effects of alcohol consumption in young people with type 1 diabetes, but the GDG noted that it has been widely reported in discussion articles that drinking alcohol can cause an increased risk of hypoglycaemia in people with type 1 diabetes. </li><li>In the absence of trial evidence, NICE based the recommendations on alcohol on advice in the <em>I</em><em>SPAD consensus guidelines for the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents</em> published by the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">ISPAD, 2000</a>], which has been updated [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-1/references/\">ISPAD, 2018</a>], and on information on the Diabetes UK website (<a href=\"https://www.diabetes.org.uk/\" data-hyperlink-id=\"b33ef866-856c-4f53-9434-abc80061b022\">www.diabetes.org.uk</a>).</li></ul><h5>Advice on exercise</h5><ul><li>NICE found limited evidence on the effects of exercise in children and young people with type 1 diabetes. </li><li>However, the GDG noted that, in general, the advantages of exercise relate more to cardioprotective effects and psychological wellbeing than to improvements in blood glucose control. In addition, clinical experience shows that exercise in children and young people with type 1 diabetes can lead to metabolic disturbances, occasionally leading to hyperglycaemia, ketosis or, more frequently, hypoglycaemia. </li><li>The GDG concluded that exercise should be encouraged in all young people with type 1 diabetes. However, understanding the glycaemic response to different types of exercise and to changes in insulin and dietary management is essential for optimal blood glucose control and prevention of exercise-induced hypoglycaemia.</li></ul><h5>Advice on smoking</h5><ul><li>Evidence identified by NICE showed that:<ul><li>Smoking causes excess morbidity and mortality.</li><li>The risk of morbidity and mortality among smokers with type 1 diabetes is greater than would be expected from simply combining the risks of smoking and type 1 diabetes. </li><li>Macrovascular complications are increased in young adults with type 1 diabetes who smoke compared with those who do not.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Advice on substance misuse</h5><ul><li>NICE found little published information on the effects of substance misuse in children and young people with type 1 diabetes.</li><li>This recommendation is therefore based on the expert opinion of the NICE GDG, who considered the well-known effects of substance misuse in the general population.</li></ul><!-- end field d3f552cd-cab7-430c-924d-14a72eb682b7 --><!-- end item ab057f04-982a-41cd-ba13-58f8ed167bcd
