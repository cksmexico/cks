There may or may not be a history of a contributory factor, such as straining with coughing or constipation. It may be associated with hypertension. On examination, there is an area of localised, well-demarcated haemorrhage in one eye, in the absence of pain, no reduction of visual acuity, normal pupil reactions, and no corneal staining.</li><li><strong>Subtarsal or conjunctival foreign body </strong>- for more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/corneal-superficial-injury/\">Corneal superficial injury</a>.</li><li><strong>Corneal abrasion </strong>- for more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/corneal-superficial-injury/\">Corneal superficial injury</a>.</li><li><strong>Episcleritis</strong>. This presents with redness and pain in one or both eyes.

For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/child-maltreatment-recognition-management/\">Child maltreatment - recognition and management</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Serious and potentially sight-threatening causes of red eye include:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Acute glaucoma. </strong>This occurs when the usual drainage of aqueous humor into the anterior chamber suddenly becomes blocked. It is clinically characterized by pain in the eye (usually unilateral), headache, blurring of vision with lights seen surrounded by halos, and nausea or vomiting. Signs include reduced visual acuity, a tender and hard eye, ciliary injection and a fixed and mid-dilated pupil which is unresponsive to bright light. Pupil dilating drops, such as phenylephrine, and systemic antimuscarinic medicines, such as tricyclics, can precipitate acute glaucoma. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/glaucoma/\">Glaucoma</a>.</li><li><strong>Serious corneal causes. </strong>These include corneal ulcer (bacterial, viral or fungal), contact lens-related red eye and corneal foreign body.<ul><li><strong>Corneal ulcer and contact lens-related red eye</strong> may start with a foreign body sensation. Usual symptoms include photophobia, blurred vision, discharge, and pain. On examination, there may be severe conjunctival injection, discharge, eyelid swelling and corneal ulceration demonstrated by fluorescein. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/herpes-simplex-ocular/\">Herpes simplex - ocular</a>.</li><li>In <strong>corneal foreign body</strong>, there is often a prior history of wind blowing a foreign body into the eye, or the use of hammering or grinding tools. Symptoms include foreign body sensation, pain, and photophobia.  A corneal foreign body may be seen on examination. Visual acuity and pupil reflexes are usually normal. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/corneal-superficial-injury/\">Corneal superficial injury</a>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Anterior uveitis. </strong>This is inflammation of the anterior segment of the eye. It may be associated with other inflammatory disorders, such as ankylosing spondylitis, but the cause of the inflammation is usually not known. Clinical features include pain, which may be worse when the person is contracting the ciliary muscles, photophobia, watering of the eye, ciliary injection and constricted or distorted pupil. Vision may be normal or reduced. For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/uveitis/\">Uveitis</a>.</li><li><strong>Scleritis. </strong>This is inflammation of the sclera (the white outer wall of the eye), and is characterized by severe pain. It can be associated with connective tissue disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. On examination, there may be reduced visual acuity and abnormal pupil reactions, depending on the site of the inflammation. Scleritis can lead to perforation of the globe.  </li><li><strong>Trauma. </strong>Such as penetrating eye injury or high-velocity foreign body. If there is a history of high-velocity injury (for example injuries occurring while hammering or chiseling) or an injury involving glass, this should be treated as a penetrating injury until proven otherwise. These should all be referred immediately to the emergency eye service. It is important to remember that a foreign body may not always be visible.  </li><li><strong>Chemical injuries. </strong>These can cause lasting problems with the ocular surface. Alkali solutions can be very harmful.</li><li><strong>Neonatal conjunctivitis. </strong>This is diagnosed in any infant who presents with conjunctivitis with discharge in the first 28 days of life. It is important to differentiate this from discharge due to poor drainage of the lacrimal duct.  In this case, there is not conjunctival inflammation. Serious causes of neonatal conjunctivitis include gonorrhoea and chlamydia. Corneal ulceration may occur in gonorrhoeal conjunctivitis. Neonatal chlamydial infection can be associated with a systemic infection, such as pneumonia. Therefore infants should be referred to paediatrics for same-day assessment of their conjunctivitis.
