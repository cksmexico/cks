Symptoms are variable (often worse at night, first thing in the morning, and upon exercise or exposure to cold or allergens, or after taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication or beta-blockers).</li><li><strong>Signs </strong>— during an acute episode, the respiratory rate is increased, and wheeze is usually present.</li><li>Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) is reduced during an acute episode.</li><li>Acute asthma is:<ul><li>Life-threatening — when PEFR is less than 33% of predicted, or any of the following are present: oxygen saturation of less than 92%, hypotension, cyanosis, poor respiratory effort, a silent chest, exhaustion, arrhythmia or impaired level of consciousness.</li><li>Severe — when PEFR is 33–50% of predicted, or any of the following are present; respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute or greater, a heart rate of 110 beats per minute or greater, or an inability to complete full sentences.</li><li>Moderate — when PEFR is 50%-75% of predicted, without any features of severe or life-threatening acute asthma.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</strong><ul><li><strong>History </strong>— typically, the person is older than 35 years of age, is a smoker (or past smoker) and reports slowly progressive breathlessness.</li><li><strong>Symptoms </strong>— persistent progressive exertional breathlessness that is often associated with wheezing and a cough (productive of sputum). Acute exacerbations of symptoms are common, and are frequently caused by respiratory tract infection.  Frequent winter 'bronchitis' may be described.</li><li><strong>Signs </strong>— there may be no abnormal signs but wheeze, hyperinflated chest, purse lip breathing or cachexia may be present. There may be signs of right-sided heart failure in people with severe disease, including swollen ankles and increased jugular venous pressure (JVP). New-onset cyanosis and/or peripheral oedema, marked dyspnoea, tachypnoea, purse lip breathing, accessory muscle use and acute confusion are suggestive of a severe exacerbation. Crackles may be present when exacerbation is infective.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Pneumonia</strong><ul><li><strong>Symptoms </strong>— cough associated with at least one other symptom of breathlessness, sputum production, wheeze, or pleuritic pain.</li><li><strong>Signs </strong>— any focal chest sign (such as dull percussion note, bronchial breathing, coarse crackles, or increased vocal fremitus/resonance) plus at least one systemic feature (such as fever/sweating or myalgia), with or without a temperature greater than 38°C. There may be signs of an associated pleural effusion.<ul><li>Note that these features may be absent, particularly in the elderly.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Pulmonary embolism (PE)</strong><ul><li><strong>Risk factors </strong>— immobilization, surgery, cancer, acute medical illness, obesity, prolonged travel, symptoms or signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), previous DVT, thrombophilia, or age over 60 years.</li><li><strong>Symptoms </strong>— acute-onset breathlessness (in 73% of people with PE), pleuritic pain (66%), cough (37%), haemoptysis (13%). Severe cases may lead to dizziness or syncope.</li><li><strong>Signs </strong>— tachypnoea of 20 breaths per minute or greater (in 70% of people with PE), crackles (51%), tachycardia (30%), signs of DVT (11%). Hypoxia, pyrexia, elevated JVP, widely split second heart sound, tricuspid regurgitation murmur, pleural rub, hypotension and cardiogenic shock may also occur.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Pneumothorax/tension pneumothorax</strong><ul><li><strong>Risk factors </strong>— smoking, age and body type (adults who are young, tall, and slim), previous pneumothorax, chronic respiratory disease (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma), trauma to chest wall (including therapeutic procedures such as injections and aspirations).</li><li><strong>Symptoms </strong>— collapse, sudden-onset pleuritic pain, breathlessness.</li><li><strong>Signs </strong>— reduced chest wall movements, reduced breath sounds, reduced vocal fremitus, and increased resonance of the percussion note on the affected side. Tension pneumothorax can result in a rapid development of severe symptoms associated with tracheal deviation away from the pneumothorax, tachycardia, and hypotension.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Pleural effusion</strong><ul><li><strong>Causes </strong>— heart, liver, or renal failure, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, cancer (including mesothelioma), tuberculosis, pleural infection (empyema), and autoimmune disease.</li><li><strong>Symptoms </strong>— progressive breathlessness, pleuritic pain and symptoms of the underlying condition.</li><li><strong>Signs </strong>— reduced chest wall movements on the affected side, stony dull percussion note, diminished or absent breath sounds, decreased tactile vocal fremitus/vocal resonance and bronchial breathing just above the effusion. There may be signs of the underlying condition.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Lung/lobar collapse</strong><ul><li><strong>Causes </strong>— airway compression (for example by enlarged lymph nodes caused by cancer or tuberculosis) or blockage (secondary to pneumonia or an inhaled foreign body).</li><li><strong>Symptoms </strong>— breathlessness, cough.</li><li><strong>Signs </strong>— reduced chest wall movement on the affected side, dull percussion note with bronchial breathing, reduced or diminished breath sounds, reduced or absent vocal resonance, mediastinal displacement towards the lesion.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Bronchiectasis</strong><ul><li><strong>History </strong>— suspect in people with a history of recurrent or chronic productive cough, especially if they do not smoke.  </li><li><strong>Symptoms </strong>— cough with daily sputum production (present in 75–100% of adults), progressive breathlessness (72–83%), haemoptysis (51–45%), non-pleuritic chest pain between exacerbations (31%).</li><li><strong>Signs </strong>— coarse crackles during early inspiration that are heard in the affected areas, usually in the lower lung fields (70% of adults). Others include wheeze (34%) and large airway rhonci (44%). Finger clubbing occurs infrequently.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Interstitial lung disease (ILD)</strong><ul><li><strong>Causes </strong>— include idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, pneumoconioses, ILD associated with drug therapy, ILD associated with connective tissue disease, and hypersensitivity pneumonitis/extrinsic allergic alveolitis (following sensitization to inhaled environmental allergens; for example from birds, hay, or mushrooms).</li><li><strong>Symptoms </strong>— cough and slowly progressive breathlessness. When it is caused by extrinsic allergic alveolitis there may be a history of recurrent episodes of flu-like illness following exposure to the responsible allergen. There may be symptoms of the underlying cause (for example joint pains when the ILD is associated with connective tissue disease).</li><li><strong>Signs </strong>— there may be none in sarcoidosis. When present, there may be fine end-inspiratory crepitations (indicative of fibrosis), finger clubbing, cyanosis, and signs of right heart failure.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Lung or pleural cancer</strong><ul><li><strong>Risk factors </strong>— smoking, asbestos exposure.</li><li><strong>Symptoms </strong>— cough, shortness of breath, haemoptysis, chest pain, weight loss, appetite loss, fatigue, hoarseness, persistent chest infections, symptoms relating to bone or brain metastases.</li><li><strong>Signs </strong>— chest examination is often normal but there may be unilateral wheeze, decreased breath sounds, or signs of pleural effusion.  Other signs include finger clubbing, and supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field
