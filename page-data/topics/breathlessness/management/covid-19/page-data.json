However, a face-to-face consultation should not be arranged solely to calculate a NEWS2 score.</li></ul><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Differentiating viral COVID-19 pneumonia from bacterial pneumonia</strong></p><ul><li class=\"MsoNormal\">It is difficult to determine whether pneumonia has a COVID‑19 viral cause or a bacterial cause (either primary or secondary to COVID‑19) in primary care, particularly during remote consultations. However, as COVID‑19 becomes more prevalent in the community, people presenting with pneumonia symptoms are more likely to have a COVID‑19 viral pneumonia than a community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\">COVID‑19 viral pneumonia may be more likely if the person:<ul><li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l8 level1 lfo8; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\">Presents with a history of typical COVID‑19 symptoms for about a week.</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l8 level1 lfo8; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\">Has severe muscle pain (myalgia).</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l8 level1 lfo8; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\">Has loss of sense of smell (anosmia).</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l8 level1 lfo8; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\">Is breathless but has no pleuritic pain.</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l8 level1 lfo8; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\">Has a history of exposure to known or suspected COVID‑19, such as a household or workplace contact.</li></ul></li><li class=\"MsoNormal\">A bacterial cause of pneumonia may be more likely if the person:<ul><li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l0 level1 lfo9; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\">Becomes rapidly unwell after only a few days of symptoms.</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l0 level1 lfo9; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\">Does not have a history of typical COVID‑19 symptoms.</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l0 level1 lfo9; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\">Has pleuritic pain.</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l0 level1 lfo9; tab-stops: list 36.0pt;\">Has purulent sputum.</li></ul></li></ul><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Deciding about hospital admission</strong></p><ul><li class=\"MsoNormal\">Be aware that older people, or those with comorbidities, frailty, impaired immunity, or a reduced ability to cough and clear secretions, are more likely to develop severe COVID-19-related pneumonia. Because this can lead to respiratory failure and death, hospital admission would have been the usual recommendation for these people before the COVID‑19 pandemic.</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\">When making decisions about hospital admission, take into account:<ul><li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l4 level1 lfo1;
