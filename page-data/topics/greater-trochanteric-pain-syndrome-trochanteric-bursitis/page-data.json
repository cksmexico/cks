Risk factors for a poorer outcome include higher initial pain intensity, longer duration of pain, greater movement restriction, higher functional impairment, and older age.</li><li>The diagnosis of greater trochanteric pain syndrome is made on clinical grounds.<ul><li>Core clinical features include lateral hip pain, point tenderness adjacent to the greater trochanter, and a positive Trendelenburg test.</li><li>The location, radiation, nature, and onset of pain, and what aggravates or relieves it should be determined.</li><li>Point tenderness and evidence of pain when muscles and tendons attached to the greater trochanter are put under tension should be assessed on examination.</li><li>Alternative diagnoses, for example sports hernia, osteoarthritis, lumbar nerve root compression, and infection of the bursa should be excluded.</li></ul></li><li>A person presenting with greater trochanteric pain syndrome should be:<ul><li>Reassured that the condition is usually self-limiting.</li><li>Advised to avoid activity which may worsen the pain such as repetitive hip movements or lying on the affected hip.</li><li>Advised that an ice pack applied for 10–20 minutes several times a day may relieve symptoms.</li><li>Advised on analgesia such as paracetamol or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as ibuprofen, if needed.</li><li>Advised that losing weight may help reduce symptoms (if appropriate).</li></ul></li><li>If initial conservative treatment does not provide adequate symptom relief, a peri-trochanteric corticosteroid injection and referral to physiotherapy should be offered.</li><li>If there are signs of infected bursitis such as a tender palpable mass, redness, oedema, or warmth, the person should be referred urgently to an orthopaedic surgeon.</li><li>A rheumatologist or orthopaedic surgeon should be consulted if:<ul><li>There is doubt about the diagnosis.</li><li>Expertise in peri-trochanteric injections is not available in primary care.</li></ul></li><li>An orthopaedic surgeon should be consulted if the symptoms:<ul><li>Are related to previous hip surgery or fracture of the femur.</li><li>Persist after peri-trochanteric corticosteroid injection and/or physiotherapy.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field bade6b30-2753-4871-bbc8-aac88c752249 --><!-- end item 956ad9e2-ab21-4291-a021-aa85b5eec47a -->","topic":{"id":"f5b64608-cf1c-5e43-8737-57e5c43550a6","topicId":"312878ed-d57e-45ae-9e8d-d81933eef21e","topicName":"Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (trochanteric bursitis)","slug":"greater-trochanteric-pain-syndrome-trochanteric-bursitis","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"93366306-a91c-5e3b-b2c9-c2ba25bd6c6a","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"0793a5da-3642-58ce-b602-5e6bcd3d1fc0","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"db6919a8-9f39-59b7-90bb-8005f7a8f6a9","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"71e3ba74-5e5b-53af-90a2-64747eb09aea","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"3d3b603c-0380-5f28-9b95-f13574e76f3a","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"54aea975-a119-5ee3-8b76-439e722659bf","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"33b0bc5a-2a02-5111-8bac-32cb98e0edd9","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"e8e59fdd-81cd-58e5-ab1b-d12935423e34","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"151aa29e-1733-53b2-b17c-9218455ce895","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"ed20ef05-d37e-502a-8689-79993edfc5ed","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"d058cfb7-eb0b-5f86-9651-7d1b619f95bc","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
