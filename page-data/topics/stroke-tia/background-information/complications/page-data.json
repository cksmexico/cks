Falls can lead to further complications such as hip fracture, reduced physical activity, loss of independence and social isolation.</li><li>Spasticity and contractures. Spasticity is common following stroke and can lead to discomfort, pain, difficulties for carers and restriction of activities. Contractures can develop in limbs affected by spasticity and lead to pain and restricted movement — 60% of patients develop joint contracture within the first year of a stroke with hemiparesis.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Sensory problems</strong><ul><li>It has been estimated that up to 80% of people have some loss or alteration in sensations such as touch, temperature, and pain.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Continence problems</strong><ul><li>Urinary and faecal continence problems are common following stroke and can persist long-term. They can have a negative impact on mood, self-image, confidence, and rehabilitation and increase carer stress.</li><li>Urinary incontinence increases the risk of skin breakdown and can be exacerbated by constipation.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Pain</strong> — pain is common following stroke and can be due to neuronal damage from stroke or a pre-existing condition (such as osteoarthritis):<ul><li>Neuropathic pain or central post-stroke pain is estimated to affect 5–20% of people with stroke.</li><li>Musculoskeletal pain can occur due to prolonged immobility, abnormal posture or pre-existing conditions. </li><li>Shoulder pain is often associated with shoulder subluxation, motor weakness and spasticity and is thought to affect 17–25% of people at 6 months following stroke.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Fatigue</strong><ul><li>Post stroke fatigue can be associated with depression and anxiety, side-effects of medication, disturbed sleep, or respiratory problems.</li><li>A systematic review including 31 studies found that 23% of people at 4–26 weeks, 31–53% of people at 26 weeks, and 34% of people at 52 weeks reported fatigue after minor stroke or TIA [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">Moran, 2014</a>].</li></ul></li><li><strong>Problems with swallowing, hydration and nutrition</strong><ul><li>Dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing foods, fluids and saliva) occurs in 40–78% of people with stroke and is associated with aspiration pneumonia, disability and death. </li><li>Poor oral hygiene can lead to ulceration, discomfort and cracked lips. Increased levels of oral bacteria can increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia and sepsis.</li><li>Dehydration and malnutrition can occur due to swallowing problems, inability to self-feed, cognitive impairment, anxiety, depression, unfamiliar foods and fatigue.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Sexual dysfunction</strong><ul><li>Vascular disease, altered sensation, limited mobility, adverse effects of medication, mood disorders and fear of precipitating further strokes can lead to sexual dysfunction after stroke.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Skin problems</strong><ul><li>Reduced mobility increases the risk of pressure sores.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Visual problems </strong><ul><li>Stroke can lead to visual problems such as altered acuity, hemianopia, diplopia, nystagmus, and blurred vision.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Cognitive problems</strong><ul><li>General cognitive impairment is common in the early period following a stroke.</li><li>A systematic review and meta-analysis of 73 papers (n = 7511) found that 10% of patients had dementia before first stroke, 10% developed new dementia soon after first stroke, and over a third had dementia following recurrent stroke [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">Pendlebury, 2009</a>].</li><li>Dyspraxia (difficulty in carrying out purposeful actions) can affect activities of daily living such as dressing.</li><li>Impairment of attention and concentration can restrict independence. </li><li>Impairment of executive function can lead to difficulty in planning and executing tasks, inhibiting inappropriate impulses, regulating emotional responses and predicting consequences of actions.</li><li>Problems with spatial awareness such as left-sided neglect or hemianopia.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Difficulties with activities of daily living (ADL)</strong><ul><li>Physical and cognitive impairment following stroke can lead to difficulties with personal care, driving, work, leisure and independent living. </li><li>One in twelve people in the UK have to move into a care home following stroke.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Emotional and psychological problems</strong> <ul><li>Anxiety, depression and psychological distress are common in people with stroke and their family/carers. </li><li>A systematic review of 51 prospective, observational studies found that approximately one-third of people experienced depressive symptoms following stroke [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">Hackett, 2005</a>].</li><li>Anxiety is thought to affect a quarter of people following stroke.</li><li>Emotionalisation (an increase in emotional behaviour with minimal stimuli such as crying or, less often, laughing) affects about 20% of people in the first six months following stroke. More than 10% of people remain affected in the long-term.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Communication problems</strong><ul><li>Dysphasia (difficulty in speaking, understanding, reading and writing) affects about one third of people with stroke.</li><li>Dysarthria (motor speech impairment) is common in the early period following stroke and is often associated with dysphagia.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Financial problems</strong><ul><li>Loss of income.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">Martino, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">Pendlebury, 2009</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">Batchelor, 2010</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">Doyle, 2010</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">Hackett, 2010</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">Campbell Burton, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">Jauch, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">Moran, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">Rosenbaum, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2015a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2015b</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">British Columbia Medical Association, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">Eskes, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">Hepworth, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">RCP, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">Winstein, 2016</a>]</p><!-- end field 9ea9745c-7462-4aa4-aa3f-1b197d9c4e65 --><!-- end item c6211c0c-dafa-47e4-9125-dec6404a1eae -->","topic":{"id":"f543bb01-4edc-57a6-ba31-aaa6b6b6e6e8","topicId":"63954e32-591d-4f33-bcbb-3fdecfc69796","topicName":"Stroke and TIA","slug":"stroke-tia","lastRevised":"Last revised in August 2020","chapters":[{"id":"3690cd7d-0a6b-548a-a527-b276c3924bab","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"aef0c419-4ee2-52b6-b781-c8afa9a11104","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"f8baebfc-07d7-5c4a-8d95-4d2bf1f42c38","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"3fa3210c-0be8-5167-adb3-6c05aaef00bc","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"e606f403-4b76-5e30-a38d-6aa4b6e3b4b1","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"fe337d01-2447-58d3-93e8-a6b09a4920d4","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"08277b76-a6c4-566a-a594-131c32067735","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"acf4fa85-325c-5018-8bc2-9d877522bf6f","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"18bc44dc-3e6b-58ae-9d3c-abca76b13c16","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"4eb59f42-29b3-56e1-993f-1ce8ab7b2969","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"08107877-662b-59e6-a30a-b21e19250f23","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
