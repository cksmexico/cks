Widespread cerebral hypoperfusion may present with non-focal or global deficits.<ul><li>TIA should be suspected when a person presents with sudden onset, focal neurological deficit which has

24 hours.</li></ul></li><li>Management of a suspected acute stroke (or emergent TIA) in primary care includes:<ul><li>Immediate emergency admission to a stroke unit.</li><li>Provision of adequate

week.</li><li>Arranging immediate admission if the person has a bleeding disorder or is taking an anticoagulant.</li><li>Discussing the need for urgent admission with a stroke specialist if the person is suspected of having had more than one TIA, has a suspected cardioembolic source or severe carotid stenosis, may be unable to attend for urgent review or lacks a reliable observer at home.</li><li>Referral for specialist assessment as soon as possible within 7 days if the suspected TIA occurred more than one week previously.</li><li>Advising the person not to drive until
