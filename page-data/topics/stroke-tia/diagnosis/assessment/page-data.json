reducing time to diagnosis and treatment and improving outcomes [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">Jauch, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">RCP, 2016</a>].</li><li>Pre-hospital care of people with suspected stroke should minimise time to arrival at hospital and should include a hospital pre-alert to expedite specialist assessment and treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">RCP, 2016</a>].</li></ul><h4>Screen for stroke or TIA using a validated tool</h4><ul><li>People with the sudden onset of focal neurological symptoms seen in the community should be screened for stroke or TIA using a validated tool [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">RCP, 2016</a>].<ul><li>The FAST test is often used as the screening tool of choice for clinicians and the general public [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">Harbison et al, 2003</a>].<ul><li>88% of all strokes and TIAs have one or more of the symptoms described in the FAST test [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">Jauch, 2013</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The FAST test will <em>not</em> identify all people with stroke for example those with sudden onset of visual disturbance or lateralising cerebellar dysfunction.</li><li>The Royal College of Physicians recommend that if community based clinicians are suspicious of stroke despite a negative FAST test they should manage as suspected stroke — diagnosis must be excluded by a specialist stroke clinician [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">RCP, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Suspect haemorrhagic stroke</h4><ul><li>Suspect subarachnoid haemorrhage in anyone presenting with sudden severe headache and an altered neurological state until proven otherwise [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">RCP, 2016</a>].</li><li>About 80% of patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) due to aneurysm report sudden onset of ‘the worst headache of their life’. <ul><li>Sentinel headache occurs in up to 40% of people with SAH in the preceding two to eight weeks [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/stroke-tia/references/\">Yew, 2015</a>].</li><li>Headache may be associated with altered neurological state [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\"
