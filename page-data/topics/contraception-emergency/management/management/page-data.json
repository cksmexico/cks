Therefore, a Cu-IUD can also be inserted up to 5 days after ovulation (for example, until day 19 of a regular, 28-day cycle) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/contraception-emergency/references/\">FSRH, 2020</a>].<ul><li>Ovulation occurs about 14 days before the onset of menstruation.</li><li>It is established practice that the earliest likely ovulation date is estimated as the date of the start of the last menstrual period (LMP) plus the number of days in the shortest cycle minus 14.</li><li>The LMP must be accurately known and cycles must be regular in order to make the estimation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/contraception-emergency/references/\">FSRH, 2020</a>].</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h5>Use of liver enzyme-inducing drugs</h5><ul><li>The metabolism of both ulipristal acetate and levonorgestrel is increased during, and for 28 days after, use of drugs that induce liver enzymes [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/contraception-emergency/references/\">FSRH, 2020</a>].</li><li>The FSRH advises that although the clinical relevance of this interaction in terms of potential reduction in effectiveness is unknown, a Cu-IUD should be recommended for women using enzyme-inducing drugs if the criteria for use are met, as the Cu-IUD is unaffected by liver enzyme induction. Alternatively, a single dose of 3 mg levonorgestrel (double the licensed dose) can be used off-label as recommended by the British National Formulary (BNF) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).</li><li>The FSRH highlights that the effectiveness of 3 mg levonorgestrel for emergency contraception in this situation has not been studied and that the use of a double dose of ulipristal acetate is not recommended.</li></ul><h5>Use of progestogens</h5><ul><li>See the section on <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/contraception-emergency/management/management/#basis-for-recommendation-be0\">Continuing or starting contraception after&nbsp;ulipristal acetate</a> for more information.</li></ul><h5>Ulipristal acetate not suitable for use by women who have severe asthma controlled by oral glucocorticoids</h5><ul><li>The Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for ellaOne<sup>®</sup> advises against the use of ulipristal acetate in women with severe asthma controlled with oral steroids because of the antiglucocorticoid effect of ulipristal acetate [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/contraception-emergency/references/\">ABPI, 2017</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field 6069d816-c8b1-4341-92fa-acbf011925c0 --><!-- end item 42891fab-81d2-4031-9727-10630b648c95 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"ac3cd56e-7027-5673-b802-588c914c2d09","slug":"risks-adverse-effects","fullItemName":"Risks and adverse effects","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field e7c1355f-1bf5-4338-8e87-acd700b0566c --><h3>What are the possible risks and adverse effects of the different types of emergency contraception?</h3><!-- end field e7c1355f-1bf5-4338-8e87-acd700b0566c -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item f39f4ac8-fe47-4d6e-8bf4-e9f50bbd190f --><!-- begin field e0115543-af22-4bf1-834f-acd700b0566c --><!-- end field e0115543-af22-4bf1-834f-acd700b0566c --><!-- end item f39f4ac8-fe47-4d6e-8bf4-e9f50bbd190f -->","subChapters":[{"id":"47ba6ee3-4bb0-5609-bf7e-a0f433971926","slug":"copper-intrauterine-device","fullItemName":"Copper intrauterine device","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 05044f9c-95a9-4b33-8138-acd700b0566c --><h4>What are the possible risks and adverse effects of the copper intrauterine device?</h4><!-- end field 05044f9c-95a9-4b33-8138-acd700b0566c -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item ad1f0c26-7422-46ac-892d-86b5bba96119 --><!-- begin field 25cfcb42-590d-4247-aaa4-acd700b0566c --><ul><li><strong>Possible risks and adverse effects of a copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) include:</strong><ul><li><strong>Pain on insertion</strong> — this may cause discomfort for a few hours but can be relieved with analgesics. </li><li><strong>Pelvic pain</strong> — pelvic pain or cramping has been reported by some women. </li><li><strong>Perforation of the wall of the uterus</strong> — this is rare (occurs in less than 2 in 1000 women) and is dependent on the skills of the clinician. There is an increased relative risk of perforation at the time of insertion of intrauterine contraception (IUC) in the postpartum period (within 36 weeks after giving birth) and during breastfeeding; however, the absolute risk of perforation remains low.</li><li><strong>Expulsion </strong>— the risk of expulsion is around 1 in 20 and is more common in the first year of use, especially within the first 3 months of insertion. There is a small increased risk of expulsion if the device is inserted immediately following surgical or medical termination of pregnancy.</li><li><strong>Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)</strong> — there is a low risk of PID (1.6 per 1000 women-years), which is strongly related to the insertion procedure and background risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The risk of pelvic infection is greatest in the first few weeks following IUC insertion.</li><li><strong>Ectopic pregnancy</strong> — the overall risk of ectopic pregnancy when using an IUC is very low, at about 1 in 1000 at 5 years. If pregnancy does occur with an intrauterine method in situ, the risk of an ectopic pregnancy occurring is increased; in some studies, half of the pregnancies that occurred were ectopic. The overall risk of ectopic pregnancy is reduced with the use of IUC when compared with using no contraception because IUCs are very effective methods of contraception overall.</li><li><strong>Unscheduled bleeding</strong> — irregular, prolonged, or frequent bleeding may occur in the 3–6 months following Cu-IUD insertion, but menstrual bleeding patterns tend to improve with time. </li><li><strong>Weight gain</strong> — this has been observed with the use of IUC, but evidence to support a causal association is lacking. </li><li><strong>Decreased libido</strong> — although existing evidence fails to support a negative effect on libido associated with IUC use. </li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 25cfcb42-590d-4247-aaa4-acd700b0566c --><!-- end item ad1f0c26-7422-46ac-892d-86b5bba96119 -->","subChapters":[]},{"id":"e8222066-2bdd-5ac8-b971-c69e91bee3d3","slug":"ulipristal-acetate","fullItemName":"Ulipristal acetate","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 64a645c5-4739-4937-bb08-acd700b25076 --><h4>What are the possible risks and adverse effects of ulipristal acetate?</h4><!-- end field 64a645c5-4739-4937-bb08-acd700b25076 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 1a3847d6-085d-4e93-9ed5-af0b35680a8c --><!-- begin field 886f2159-7daf-4e30-aa69-acd700b25076 --><ul><li><strong>Vomiting</strong> is common with ulipristal acetate.<ul><li>If the woman vomits up to 3 hours after taking ulipristal acetate, she should take a second dose as soon as possible.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Menstrual irregularities </strong>are also common.<br><ul><li>If the woman has early mild bleeding or spotting, this is probably caused by ulipristal acetate and may not be the start of the next menstrual cycle.

This remains the advice after levonorgestrel EC administration, but not for ulipristal acetate.</li><li>Evidence from a prospective, randomized, pharmacodynamic study (n = 71) identified by the FSRH showed that starting a desogestrel progestogen-only pill (POP) immediately after ulipristal acetate reduces the ability of ulipristal acetate to delay ovulation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/contraception-emergency/references/\">Brache, 2015</a>]. There are currently no studies to investigate whether this affects pregnancy rates or whether quick starting other types of hormonal contraception (CHC and the progestogen-only implant and injectable) after ulipristal acetate has the same effect.</li><li>Extrapolating from this evidence, the FSRH recommends that women should wait 5 days (at least 120 hours) after taking ulipristal acetate before continuing or starting a CHC (pill, patch, or vaginal ring) or progestogen-only contraception (pill, implant, or injectable). This ensures that the ulipristal acetate is as effective as possible in preventing pregnancy resulting from the episode(s) of UPSI for which it was taken. Importantly, there is a risk of pregnancy if there is further UPSI before ongoing contraception is started and becomes effective.</li><li>The FSRH points out that there is one specific exception to this: if CHC pills are restarted after a scheduled hormone-free interval and pills are then missed later in the first week of pill taking, ulipristal acetate may be considered, with immediate restart of pill taking. If ulipristal acetate is used in this specific situation, pill-taking can be resumed immediately after taking the ulipristal acetate.
