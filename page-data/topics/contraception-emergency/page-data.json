If fertilization does occur, the Cu-IUD has an anti-implantation effect.</li><li>Ulipristal acetate acts by delaying ovulation for at least 5 days, until sperm from the UPSI for which it was taken are no longer viable. It delays ovulation even after the start of the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. </li><li>Levonorgestrel acts by inhibiting ovulation. If taken prior to the start of the LH surge, levonorgestrel inhibits ovulation for the next 5 days, until sperm from the UPSI for which it was taken are no longer viable. In the late follicular phase, however, levonorgestrel becomes ineffective (unlike ulipristal acetate).</li></ul></li><li>Oral EC should be taken as soon as possible after UPSI to maximize efficacy. Oral EC taken after ovulation is ineffective.</li><li>When a woman requests EC:<ul><li>A full history should be taken to confirm whether EC is indicated. The possibility of pregnancy should be reasonably excluded.</li><li>The choice of EC should be made with the woman, taking additional factors into consideration, such as the UK Medical Eligibility Criteria, the woman's preference, current medication, whether she is postpartum or breastfeeding, her body mass index/weight, and timing of UPSI.</li><li>The woman should be given enough information on the different methods of EC to help her make an informed choice. </li><li>A risk assessment should be carried out for possible sexual abuse or non-consensual sex and for sexually transmitted infections (STIs).</li><li>A regular method of contraception should be offered if the woman is not using regular contraception. </li></ul></li><li>The Cu-IUD is the most effective method of EC and should be offered to all women requiring EC, provided the criteria for insertion are met and the method is acceptable to the woman. The Cu-IUD can be inserted for EC within 5 days after the first UPSI in a cycle or within 5 days of the earliest estimated date of ovulation.</li><li>If the Cu-IUD is unsuitable or not acceptable to the woman, oral EC should be considered:<ul><li>Ulipristal acetate is licensed for use within 5 days (120 hours) after UPSI or contraceptive failure.</li><li>Levonorgestrel is licensed for use within 72 hours after UPSI or contraceptive failure.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field c2d68ac5-e15e-4756-a02c-28d5750a8618 --><!-- end item 7e40eb95-329e-46ac-ba3a-d2134c3f5963 -->","topic":{"id":"34b55d4c-9cac-525d-86dc-99cef03c6806","topicId":"9cd56dfa-04c2-427b-b19d-f31d21101fcf","topicName":"Contraception -
