The term ‘insect’ is used throughout this CKS topic to include both arachnids and insects.</li><li><strong>Insect bites</strong><ul><li>Some insects (such as mosquitos, bed bugs and fleas) have mouthparts which pierce the skin with little trauma — bites from these insects may not be noticed straight away.</li><li>Other insects (such as horseflies and midges) do not have piercing mouthparts and take blood by lacerating the skin and lapping pooled blood in the wound — bites from these insects are usually painful and noticed immediately.</li><li>Biting insects inject compounds such as anticoagulants and vasodilators in their saliva during feeding to ensure that blood flows easily.</li><li>The presence of antigenic components in insect saliva can lead to local skin, and in rare cases, systemic reactions.<ul><li>Usually the first time a person is bitten by a particular insect, no reaction occurs (unless the saliva contains a directly toxic substance).</li><li>After repeated bites, type IV (cell-mediated or delayed) reactions may develop (8–72 hours later) causing inflamed, itchy maculopapules which persist for several days.</li><li>With continued exposure, type 1 (immediate) hypersensitivity (wheal and flare) reactions can occur within 20 minutes of the bite.<ul><li>Occasionally type IV reactions or anaphylaxis can also occur at this stage.</li></ul></li><li>If prolonged exposure to bites occurs, progressive desensitization (eventually without skin reaction) may occur.</li><li>Papular urticaria (itchy erythematous papules) is a common reaction to insect bites in children, especially those with atopic dermatitis.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Insect stings</strong><ul><li>Stinging insects (such as honeybees, bumblebees, wasps and hornets) cause a sting by injecting venom from a sac attached to a barbed or non-barbed stinger into the skin. Stings are usually immediately painful.</li><li>Honeybees and occasionally other stinging insects may leave a barbed stinger and attached venom sac in the skin after they sting.</li><li>Venom contains allergens (such as hyaluronidase and acid phosphatase) and pharmacologically active substances (such as histamine) which cause reactions ranging from mild localized pain and erythema to severe systemic reactions including anaphylaxis.</li><li>The antigenic substances in the venom of bees, wasps, and hornets are more likely to cause severe systemic hypersensitivity reactions than the antigens of most other insects.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/insect-bites-stings/references/\">Golden et al, 2011</a>;
