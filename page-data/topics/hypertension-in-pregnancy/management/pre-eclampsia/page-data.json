of pregnancy <em>and </em>the coexistence of 1 or more of the following new-onset conditions:</strong><ul><li><strong>Proteinuria</strong>, <em><strong>or</strong></em></li><li><strong>Other maternal organ dysfunction:</strong><ul><li><strong>Renal insufficiency </strong>(creatinine 90 micromol/litre or more, 1.02 mg/100 ml or more).</li><li><strong>Liver involvement </strong>(elevated transaminases [alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase over 40 IU/litre] with or without right upper quadrant or epigastric abdominal pain).</li><li><strong>Neurological complications</strong> such as eclampsia, altered mental status, blindness, stroke, clonus, severe headaches or persistent visual scotomata.</li><li><strong>Haematological complications</strong> such as thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 150,000/microlitre), disseminated intravascular coagulation or haemolysis.</li><li><strong>Uteroplacental dysfunction</strong> such as fetal growth restriction, abnormal umbilical artery doppler waveform analysis, or stillbirth.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Be aware that women are considered to be at high risk of pre-eclampsia if they have:</strong><ul><li><strong>One of the following high risk factors:</strong><ul><li>A history of hypertensive disease during a previous pregnancy.</li><li>Chronic kidney disease.</li><li>Autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome.</li><li>Type 1 or type 2 diabetes.</li><li>Chronic hypertension.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Two or more of the following moderate risk factors:</strong><ul><li>First pregnancy.</li><li>Aged 40 years or older.</li><li>Pregnancy interval of more than 10 years.</li><li>Body mass index (BMI) of 35 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>or greater at the first visit.</li><li>Family history of pre-eclampsia.</li><li>Multiple pregnancy.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>For women assessed to be at high risk of pre-eclampsia:</strong><ul><li><strong>Refer for consultant-led care</strong> at booking for specialist input to assess and manage the obstetric risk.</li><li><strong>Ensure that aspirin 75—150 mg daily is prescribed from 12 weeks' gestation until birth.</strong> This is usually arranged in secondary care, but should be initiated in primary care if the woman will not be seen by a specialist until after 12 weeks.<ul><li>Seek specialist advice before prescribing aspirin to girls younger than 16 years of age, and in those with thrombophilia or uncontrolled blood pressure. There is no evidence that use of low-dose aspirin in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of congenital abnormalities or other fetal complications.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Offer advice about healthy lifestyle</strong> (including rest, work, exercise, and weight) as recommended for all pregnant women.

If significant proteinuria is detected but there is still uncertainty about the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia, consider re‑testing on a new sample, alongside clinical review. Seek specialist advice where there is uncertainty.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Advise all pregnant women to seek immediate medical review if they experience symptoms of pre-eclampsia (including during the first four weeks postpartum), such as:</strong><ul><li>Severe headache.</li><li>Problems with vision, such as blurring or flashing before the eyes.</li><li>Severe pain just below the ribs.</li><li>Vomiting.</li><li>Sudden swelling of the face, hands or feet.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Arrange emergency secondary care assessment for any woman in whom pre-eclampsia is suspected. </strong>Advise women with severe hypertension (blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg or more) then they will be offered hospital admission for ongoing monitoring of their condition and of their baby's wellbeing.<ul><li>Women with less severe hypertension may be offered admission depending upon whether there are clinical concerns for the wellbeing of the woman or baby or if they are considered to be at high risk of adverse events. If there are no such concerns, the woman will be offered ongoing specialist management on an outpatient basis.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 4614da47-2d54-462d-9a0d-183f774df735 --><!-- end item f266a956-8d0d-4208-977c-5f511cbdedbf -->","subChapters":[{"id":"8ea22168-cfac-5282-8db2-eea7fd22eca7","slug":"basis-for-recommendation-df1","fullItemName":"Basis for recommendation","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field bddda9c8-ea89-43a8-86b2-f73934c22c9b --><h4>Basis for recommendation</h4><!-- end field bddda9c8-ea89-43a8-86b2-f73934c22c9b -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item df17ebf2-713f-487b-9108-708917a76898 --><!-- begin field 2a14ea96-f630-4108-85ec-6fec438cf2fc --><p>The recommendations on management of women at high risk of, or exhibiting clincical featues of pre-eclampsia are largely based on expert opinion in the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline <em>Hypertension in pregnancy: diagnosis and management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypertension-in-pregnancy/references/\">NICE, 2019b</a>].</p><h5>Early referral to obstetrics</h5><ul><li>In the absence of any explicit guidance from NICE, the recommendation to refer those at high risk of pre-eclampsia early in pregnancy is based on the Pre-eclampsia Community Guideline (PRECOG).<ul><li>The pre-eclampsia specialists in the guideline development group reviewed the available evidence and concluded that these women may benefit from specialist input to assess their obstetric risk [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypertension-in-pregnancy/references/\">PRECOG, 2004</a>].
