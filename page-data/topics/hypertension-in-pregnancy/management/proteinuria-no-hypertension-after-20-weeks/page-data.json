Expert opinion within the earlier <em>Pre-eclampsia Community Guideline</em> (PRECOG) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypertension-in-pregnancy/references/\">PRECOG, 2004</a>] states that proteinuria may be the first clinical indication of pre-eclampsia.</li><li>The recommendation to arrange secondary care assessment for women with [2+] proteinuria is largely based on PRECOG guidelines that all women over 20 weeks' gestation with [2+] proteinuria or more on dipstick testing should be referred for hospital assessment within 48 hours, as this may indicate impending pre-eclampsia or an underlying medical problem [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypertension-in-pregnancy/references/\">PRECOG, 2004</a>], and from expert opinion in a narrative review that 'a urinary tract infection rarely causes more than [1+] proteinuria' [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hypertension-in-pregnancy/references/\">Williams and Craft, 2012</a>].
