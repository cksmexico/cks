for superficial fungal infections because of rare reports of liver damage [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-oral/references/\">CSM, 1983</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-oral/references/\">CSM, 1984</a>]. The MHRA has advised that ketoconazole tablets should only be initiated by a physician who is experienced in the management of fungal infections because of the risk of serious hepatotoxicity. Oral ketoconazole should only be prescribed for the treatment of chronic mucocutaneous candidosis that cannot be treated topically because of the site, extent of the lesion, or deep infection of the skin, in people resistant to or intolerant of both fluconazole and itraconazole [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-oral/references/\">MHRA, 2008</a>].</li><li>Itraconazole is an alternative but it should only be used in cases of fluconazole-resistant candidiasis. It is less suitable for people at high risk of heart failure. Although reports of heart failure have been rare, the risk seems to be higher in elderly people, people with cardiac disease, people taking negative inotropic drugs (for example calcium-channel blockers), and people taking high doses or receiving longer treatment courses [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-oral/references/\">BNF 72, 2016</a>].</li><li>Fluconazole is more reliably absorbed and has a lower risk of systemic adverse effects and drug interactions than itraconazole and it is therefore the preferred treatment when an oral antifungal is considered appropriate.</li></ul></li><li>CKS recommends seeking specialist advice before initiating itraconazole in people who have not responded to a course of fluconazole due to the possibility of underlying disease and the increased risk of drug interactions and adverse effects.</li></ul><!-- end field 9a17969c-cf17-4c0f-94a1-8cd89260391d --><!-- end item
