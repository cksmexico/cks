Rich sources include cod liver oil (this also contains vitamin A which can be toxic in high doses) and oily fish (such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines). Egg yolk, meat, offal, milk, and mushrooms contain small amounts.</li><li>Vitamin D-fortified foods include fat spreads and some breakfast cereals, yoghurts, and formula milk for infants and toddlers.</li><li>Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplements are synthesized by UVB irradiation of 7-DHC from sheep wool, and vitamin D<sub>2</sub> by UVB irradiation of ergosterol from fungi.  </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Dietary and cutaneous vitamin D are biologically inactive and require enzymatic conversion to the active metabolite </strong><strong>1,25-hydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]<sub>2</sub>D).</strong><ul><li>Vitamin D is converted in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), the main circulating metabolite. This is then converted to 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D in the kidneys and other tissues.</li><li>The production of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D is regulated by the action of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) on the kidneys: a rise in PTH levels stimulates the synthesis of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D and vice versa.</li></ul></li><li><strong>The best indicator of vitamin D exposure (from the diet and sunlight) is the serum concentration of 25(OH)D.</strong> This is because it has a long half-life in the circulation (about 2–3 weeks) and is not subject to tight homeostatic control. As a result, it provides an indication of vitamin D availability over recent weeks.<ul><li>Serum 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D concentration is not a suitable indicator of vitamin D exposure because it has a short half-life (less than 4 hours); it is homeostatically regulated; the plasma concentrations are not directly regulated by vitamin D intake (but by other factors, such as plasma PTH levels); and even in the presence of severe vitamin D deficiency, plasma concentrations may be normal or even elevated as a result of upregulation of cytochrome P450 27B1 (the enzyme which catalyzes the hydroxylation of 25[OH]D to 1,25[OH]<sub>2</sub>D).</li></ul></li><li><strong>In the UK the evidence identified by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN)</strong> suggests that the risk of poor musculoskeletal health is increased at serum 25(OH)D concentration below 25 nmol/L [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-children/references/\">SACN, 2016</a>]. See the section on <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-children/management/prevention-of-vitamin-d-deficiency/#prevention\">Prevention of vitamin D deficiency</a> for more information.</li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-children/references/\">National Osteoporosis Society, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-children/references/\">BMJ, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-children/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-children/references/\">SACN, 2016</a>]</p><!-- end field 7712bfef-d2dc-47c1-a572-8c23f45c348f --><!-- end item 31b6b679-678d-4cc5-8f05-dc9c551ed818 -->","topic":{"id":"89d3d3f2-0fb9-5122-8124-8a248851c341","topicId":"6f02f244-d6e1-47d2-9f6e-90aba05fc9ca","topicName":"Vitamin D deficiency in children","slug":"vitamin-d-deficiency-in-children","lastRevised":"Last revised in December 2020","chapters":[{"id":"e4e640d6-bbf5-5522-a672-0b8deafbd735","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"94a73733-1425-56b2-a893-d4a53490d450","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"661f310f-639f-5c8e-a460-568d5c5f6048","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"c56937b4-3157-58c7-bd9a-44f0caed21c6","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"d6925710-6f4f-59e1-8964-e7227711dc54","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"b836020c-d6cc-532a-9d4e-3ab2d16e6e4d","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"b06d6ba1-b7cc-5f6b-b6f1-251fab92d88b","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"43dfe300-848d-5ce3-b9af-f856fc5be1e3","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"1a7c671f-a1c3-5d70-8689-3a8a0a282b36","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"0d89edbe-b8d5-5805-bf38-9f05d1381fe5","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"a9f8eb44-4ca7-53e5-914e-981754c743c0","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
