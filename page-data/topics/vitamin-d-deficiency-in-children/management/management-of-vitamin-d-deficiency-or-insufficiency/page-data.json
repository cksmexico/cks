In their expert opinion, compliance and persistence with calcium-containing supplements is poor [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-children/references/\">NOGG, 2016</a>], possibly due to the unpalatability of the calcium component [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-children/references/\">Hull and Anastasiadis, 2011</a>].  </li><li>The recommendation to consider seeking specialist advice if supplemental calcium is being considered is based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice, as there is an increased risk of hypercalcaemia with concurrent high-dose vitamin D treatment.</li><li>The recommendation on calcium and vitamin D combination products is extrapolated from expert opinion in the NOS vitamin D guideline for adults [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-children/references/\">National Osteoporosis Society, 2013</a>], which states that calcium and vitamin D combination products should not be used as a source of vitamin D during high-dose vitamin D treatment.
