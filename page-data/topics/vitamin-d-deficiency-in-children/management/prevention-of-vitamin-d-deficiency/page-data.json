However, the evidence on musculoskeletal health outcomes (rickets, osteomalacia, falls, and muscle strength and function) was considered to be suggestive of a beneficial effect of vitamin D and was therefore used as the basis for setting the DRVs.</li><li>Based on the evidence for musculoskeletal outcomes, which showed an increased risk of poor musculoskeletal health at serum hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations less than 25 nmol/L, SACN recommends a vitamin D reference nutrient intake (RNI) of 400 international units (IU [10 micrograms]) daily for all children and young people aged 4 years and older, including those at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency.<ul><li>Data was insufficient to set RNIs for infants and children younger than 4 years of age, so SACN recommends a precautionary ‘Safe Intake’ of vitamin D in the range of 340–400 IU (8.5–10 micrograms) for this age group.</li></ul></li><li>An increment to the RNI was not considered necessary for people at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency because the recommendation for the RNI to be applicable throughout the year is to take account of people with minimal sunshine exposure, including those most at risk. </li><li>According to the SACN report:<ul><li>These recommendations are a precautionary approach to protect the most vulnerable groups in the population, take account of variable exposure to sunshine and diet, and ensure coverage of 97.5% of the population throughout the year. </li><li>Although most people would be expected to synthesise vitamin D during the summer months, serum 25(OH)D concentrations below 25 nmol/L have been observed in a proportion of some population groups in the UK during the summer months. Since it is not possible to identify these people, the recommendation is applicable to the UK population throughout the year. </li><li>Achievement of the proposed RNI by the UK population would lead to an increase in mean/median vitamin D intakes of the UK population, but it is unlikely that this would lead to vitamin D intakes at the upper end of the distribution reaching levels that might pose a risk of adverse effects. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p style=\"margin-left:-6.0pt;\"><strong>Not routinely monitoring serum vitamin D levels</strong></p><ul><li>This recommendation is extrapolated from the SACN vitamin D report [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-children/references/\">SACN, 2016</a>] and the National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) guideline <em>Vitamin D and bone health: a practical clinical guide for patient management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-children/references/\">National Osteoporosis Society, 2013</a>].<ul><li>SACN does not recommend routine monitoring of serum vitamin D levels during long-term supplementation with vitamin D.</li><li>Expert opinion in the NOS guideline is that routine monitoring of serum 25(OH)D levels is unnecessary for people on long-term maintenance doses of vitamin D (up to 2000 IU a day)<strong>.</strong></li></ul></li></ul><h5>Ensuring adequate calcium intake </h5><ul><li>Expert opinion in the NOS guideline <em>Vitamin D and bone health: a practical clinical guideline for management in children and young people</em> is that consideration should always be given to the need for calcium supplementation in children and young people, as there are greater risks of calcium deficiency due to their growing bones [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-children/references/\">National Osteoporosis Society, 2015</a>], and the British National Formulary (BNF) for Children recommends calcium supplements if there is evidence of poor dietary calcium intake [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-children/references/\">BNF for Children, 2017</a>].</li><li>The recommended daily intake values of dietary calcium are taken from the NOS guideline<em><strong> </strong></em>National Osteoporosis Society, 2015, Vitamin D and Bone Health: A Practical Clinical Guideline and are based on the Department of Health <em>Dietary values for food, energy and nutrients for United Kingdom</em>: r<em>eport of the panel on dietary reference values of the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy</em>. </li><li>The recommendation to consider the need for supplemental calcium only when an adequate dietary intake of calcium cannot be achieved is extrapolated from expert opinion in the National Osteoporosis Guideline Group (NOGG) guideline <em>Osteoporosis: clinical guideline for prevention and treatment</em>, which states that it may be prudent to increase dietary calcium intake and use vitamin D alone where the use of calcium and vitamin D supplementation might otherwise be considered. In their expert opinion, compliance and persistence with calcium-containing supplements is poor [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-children/references/\">NOGG, 2016</a>], possibly due to the unpalatability of the calcium component [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitamin-d-deficiency-in-children/references/\">Hull and Anastasiadis, 2011</a>].  </li><li>The recommendation to seek specialist advice if supplemental calcium is being considered is based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.
