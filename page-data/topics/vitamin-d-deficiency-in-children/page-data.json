However, there is no universal consensus on the threshold concentration used to define vitamin D deficiency in children and young people. </li><li>Evidence identified by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) suggests that the risk of poor musculoskeletal health is increased at serum 25(OH)D concentrations below 25 nmol/L.</li><li>Children and young people with insufficient exposure to sunlight and those with darker skin are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency. Other risk factors include nutritional deficiency, certain comorbidities (for example malabsorption syndromes [such as coeliac disease]), and the use of certain drugs (for example corticosteroids).</li><li>Although vitamin D deficiency is common, universal screening is only recommended in certain cases, for example if there are clinical features of rickets (such as bone deformities), other musculoskeletal symptoms (such as muscle weakness or bone pain), or a chronic disease that may increase the risk of vitamin D deficiency.</li><li>Management of vitamin D deficiency (serum 25[OH]D levels less than 25 nmol/L) includes: <ul><li>Arranging referral or seeking specialist advice, as appropriate, for example if the child or young person has features of rickets (referral is indicated).</li><li>Treating with high-dose vitamin D for 8–12 weeks, followed by daily supplemental doses of vitamin D. </li><li>Giving dietary advice (including on calcium intake) and lifestyle advice (including on safe sun exposure).</li><li>Following up the person to ensure correction of vitamin D deficiency and to assess for vitamin D toxicity (which usually manifests as hypercalcaemia).</li></ul></li><li>For children with serum 25(OH)D levels of 25 nmol/L and over, dietary and lifestyle advice should be given, unless referral or seeking specialist advice is warranted (based on clinical judgement), for example if there is persisting musculoskeletal pain.</li><li>To prevent vitamin D deficiency:<ul><li>All children and young people living in the UK should be advised to take a daily supplement containing 400 units of vitamin D (340–400 units for children aged 0–1 year) throughout the year, including in the winter months.</li><li>Dietary and lifestyle advice should also be given.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 9dbf4d08-4400-4ef8-8219-2f8aa20a9c6f --><!-- end item 021ec26d-4808-4f9d-a93e-64969754483d
