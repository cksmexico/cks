Better tolerated than bran. Must not be taken immediately before bed. Adequate fluid intake is important, to prevent intestinal obstruction. This may be difficult for the frail or children. Not recommended for people taking constipating drugs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Sterculia</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Methylcellulose</td><td colspan=\"1\">2–3 days</td><td colspan=\"1\">Useful first-line choice in adults when it is difficult to get enough fibre in the diet. Better tolerated than bran. Must not be taken immediately before bed. Adequate fluid intake is important, to prevent intestinal obstruction. This may be difficult for the frail or children. Tablets swell in the mouth on contact with water.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Wheat or oat bran</td><td colspan=\"1\">—</td><td colspan=\"1\">Finely ground bran can be given as bran bread or biscuits, but these are less effective than unprocessed bran. May be unpalatable. Can be added to food or fruit juice. Often poorly tolerated (causes flatulence and bloating) unless increased slowly and can be difficult to take enough to be effective on its own. Adequate fluid intake is important.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Osmotic laxatives</strong></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Lactulose</td><td colspan=\"1\">2–3 days</td><td colspan=\"1\">Palatable — although some find it sickly sweet. Adequate fluid intake recommended. If used alone in opioid-induced constipation, it often needs to be given in large doses that cause bloating and colic.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Macrogols (polyethylene glycol)</td><td colspan=\"1\">2–3 days</td><td colspan=\"1\">Some people find it difficult to drink the prescribed volume of macrogol. Licensed for use in faecal impaction.Idrolax<sup>®</sup> does not contain electrolytes. Movicol-Half<sup>®</sup> contains half the dose and electrolytes of Movicol<sup>®</sup></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Surface-wetting laxatives</strong></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Docusate sodium</td><td colspan=\"1\">12–72 hours</td><td colspan=\"1\">Probably acts both as a softening agent and a stimulant. May be a useful alternative for people who find it hard to increase their fluid intake.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Stimulant laxatives</strong></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Senna</td><td colspan=\"1\">8–12 hours</td><td colspan=\"1\">Licensed only for short-term use. Syrup is unpalatable.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Sodium picosulfate</td><td colspan=\"1\">6–12 hours</td><td colspan=\"1\">Licensed only for short-term use. Syrup is palatable.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Bisacodyl</td><td colspan=\"1\">6–12 hours</td><td colspan=\"1\">No syrup available. Licensed only for short-term use.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Dantron (terminal care only)</td><td colspan=\"1\">6–12 hours</td><td colspan=\"1\">Restricted to use in terminal care. Prolonged contact with the skin (e.g. faecal or urinary incontinence) can cause a dantron burn — an erythematous rash with a sharply demarcated border. Available only combined with a softener: Concerns about possible carcinogenicity (from high-dose studies in rats). People should be warned that it discolours urine red (occasionally blue or green).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Rectal laxatives</strong></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">All rectal laxatives</td><td colspan=\"1\">—</td><td colspan=\"1\">Easy to use if administered correctly. Timing of effect may be more predictable than with oral laxatives. Some people find them undignified and unpleasant to use. All unlicensed for the treatment of faecal loading/impaction except Relaxit<sup>®</sup> micro-enema and Arachis oil retention enema.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Glycerol suppositories (lubricating and weak stimulant)</td><td colspan=\"1\">15–30 minutes</td><td colspan=\"1\">Can be used for hard or soft stools. Licensed for occasional use only. Suppositories must be placed alongside the bowel wall so that body heat causes them to dissolve and distribute around the rectum. Suppositories should be moistened before use to aid insertion.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Bisacodyl suppositories (stimulant)</td><td colspan=\"1\">15 minutes to 3 hours</td><td colspan=\"1\">Avoid if large, hard stools, as no softening effect. Use for soft stools.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Sodium phosphate and sodium bicarbonate suppositories (Carbalax®)(effervescent)</td><td colspan=\"1\">30 minutes</td><td colspan=\"1\">People should be advised that these suppositories work by an effervescent action.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Docusate sodium enema(softener and weak stimulant)</td><td colspan=\"1\">15–30 minutes</td><td colspan=\"1\">Can be used for hard or soft stools. Correct administration important to prevent damage to rectal mucosa.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Sodium citrate enema (osmotic)</td><td colspan=\"1\">5–15 minutes</td><td colspan=\"1\">Smaller volume (5 mL) than a phosphate enema (130 mL). Useful to remove hard, impacted stools. Correct administration important to prevent damage to rectal mucosa. Licensed for occasional use only.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Phosphate enema (osmotic)</td><td colspan=\"1\">2–5 minutes</td><td colspan=\"1\">Useful to remove hard, impacted stools. Correct administration important to prevent damage to rectal mucosa. Licensed for occasional use only. Use of phosphate enemas can cause hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia in ill patients or in renal impairment. They can also produce rectal gangrene in ill patients with a history of haemorrhoids.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Arachis oil enema (softener)</td><td colspan=\"1\">Retention enema — used overnight and warmed before use.</td><td colspan=\"1\">Useful for hard, impacted stools. Should not be used in people with peanut allergy. Licensed for occasional use only.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Peripheral opioid–receptor antagonists</strong></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Methylnaltrexone bromide (subcutaneous injection)</td><td colspan=\"1\">30 minutes – 4 hours</td><td colspan=\"1\">Useful for opioid-induced constipation in terminally ill people, when response to other laxatives is inadequate. Contraindicated in known or suspected bowel obstruction. Use with caution in people with conditions which may predispose to perforation (e.g. gastrointestinal cancer, peptic ulcer, colonic pseudo-obstruction, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids).</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Not recommended</strong></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Liquid paraffin (softener)</td><td colspan=\"1\">1–3 days</td><td colspan=\"1\">Adverse effects include anal seepage and irritation, malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins, and (rarely) lipoid pneumonia.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Magnesium salts (osmotic)</td><td colspan=\"1\">1–6 hours</td><td colspan=\"1\">Not routinely recommended because their purgative action can be undesirably strong.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Data from the Electronic Medicines Compendium <a href=\"http://www.medicines.org.uk/\" data-hyperlink-id=\"058f26b9-3d3f-4a3e-854e-a98e00ed11f3\">www.medicines.org.uk</a> and from </strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-constipation/references/\">Kyle, 2007</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-constipation/references/\">Davies,&nbsp;2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-constipation/references/\">Sykes, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-constipation/references/\">Wyeth Canada, 2010</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-constipation/references/\">Micromedex, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-constipation/references/\">Twycross, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-constipation/references/\">BNF 72, 2016</a>]</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- end field a6020a85-1660-4def-80a5-80373b98cbe8 --><!-- end item b242edba-ad6d-4b86-bab5-a015e9e9803c -->","topic":{"id":"4a368333-0a3d-5f76-906b-e2268205df04","topicId":"5f5e551e-9e71-40c0-a276-1d902ad4a4c1","topicName":"Palliative care -
