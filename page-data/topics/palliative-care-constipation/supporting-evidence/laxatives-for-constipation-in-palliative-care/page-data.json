A significantly higher stool frequency was reported with lactulose plus senna compared with co-danthramer, regardless of the order the drugs were given in the crossover.</li><li>One unpublished crossover study of 118 people in a hospice setting compared magnesium hydroxide plus liquid paraffin (Milipar<sup>®</sup>) with lactulose plus senna. There was no difference in stool frequency between treatments, regardless of the order the drugs were given in the crossover.</li><li>Two studies, with a total of 287 participants, compared subcutaneous methylnaltrexone with placebo. Methylnaltrexone was found to be more effective than placebo at inducing a laxation response, and this response was rapid (four to 24 hours). However, an undisclosed proportion of participants continued to take conventional laxatives during these trials.</li><li>One small study of 33 people comparing the effectiveness of different doses of subcutaneous methylnaltrexone (1 mg, 5 mg, 12.5 mg, and 20 mg), found that methylnaltrexone was more effective at inducing laxation at doses of 5 mg or greater compared to a dose of 1 mg.</li></ul></li><li>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (n = 74) compared the use of docusate plus senna (n = 35) with placebo plus senna (n = 39) in adults in a hospice setting over 10 days [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-constipation/references/\">Tarumi et al, 2013</a>]. Between 92% and 94% of the participants in the docusate group, and 100% of the participants in the placebo group were taking opioids. People with both malignant and non-malignant disease were included. The results of this study were difficult to interpret because people in the placebo group had a mean daily morphine dose 66% higher than the docusate group. In addition, potential confounders were that there was no specific measure of abdominal pain, a common side effect of senna, and the dose of senna varied substantially compared with a constant dose of docusate [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-constipation/references/\">Sykes, 2013</a>].<ul><li>There was no significant benefit of docusate plus senna compared with placebo plus senna in the primary outcome measures, which were:<ul><li><strong>Stool frequency</strong>– the number of bowel movements per day in the docusate group was 0.74 (SD = 0.47) compared with 0.69 (SD = 0.37, p = 0.58) in the placebo group. The mean difference in the average number of bowel movements was 0.05, 95% CI –0.09, 0.19.</li><li><strong>Stool volume</strong>– there was no significant difference in stool volume between study groups (p = 0.06).</li><li><strong>Stool consistency</strong>– using the Bristol Stool Form Scale, more people in the placebo group tended to have Type 4 (smooth and soft, like a sausage or snake) and Type 5 (soft blobs with clear-cut edges) stool, whereas more people in the docusate group had Type 3 (sausage, cracks in surface) and Type 6 (mushy stool, fluffy pieces with ragged edges) stool (p = 0.01).</li></ul></li><li>A greater proportion of people in the placebo group (38.5%) than in the docusate group (14.3%) received another bowel intervention on day 5 of the study (p = 0.35).</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 793b841a-30ca-4f1a-8a62-9d2f27ef895f --><!-- end item cb077ef3-0af6-480d-b64c-884e71b08c64 -->","topic":{"id":"4a368333-0a3d-5f76-906b-e2268205df04","topicId":"5f5e551e-9e71-40c0-a276-1d902ad4a4c1","topicName":"Palliative care -
