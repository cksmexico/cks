Stimulant laxatives reduce intestinal ring contractions, allowing propulsive activity. Both senna and sodium picosulfate given alone are effective treatments for opioid-induced constipation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-constipation/references/\">Twycross, 2014</a>].</li><li>Constipation due to opioid analgesics is an ongoing problem as tolerance does not develop. There is no linear relationship between morphine dose and the level of constipation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-constipation/references/\">Fallon and Hanks, 1999</a>] — some people will require small dose increases and some people will require larger dose increases to counteract constipation with an increase in morphine dose.

This means that much higher doses and more frequent dosing than those specified on the product licence are often required to manage constipation (particularly opioid-induced constipation) effectively [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-constipation/references/\">Fallon and O'Neill, 1998</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-constipation/references/\">Twycross, 2014</a>].

It is more important to offer them food and drink that they like.</li><li>Phosphate enemas can sometimes cause water and electrolyte disturbances, especially in the over-65 age group and when co-morbidities are present.</li><li>Bulk-forming laxatives are less useful for constipation in palliative care because:<ul><li>Their consistency is unpalatable and they need to be taken with at least 200–300 mL water, which makes them unacceptable to many ill people.</li><li>If inadequate water is taken, they can cause intestinal obstruction.
