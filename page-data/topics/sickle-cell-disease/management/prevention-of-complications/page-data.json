below:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>People with sickle cell anaemia will be followed up regularly in secondary care. </strong><ul><li>This is done every 3 months for the first 2 years of life, every 6 months between 3 and 5 years of age, and annually thereafter. </li><li>The general aim of follow up is to:<ul><li>Encourage adherence to <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sickle-cell-disease/management/prevention-of-complications/#recommended-immunizations\">immunizations</a> and <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sickle-cell-disease/management/prevention-of-complications/#antibiotic-prophylaxis\">prophylactic antibiotics</a>.</li><li>Provide education about the disease.</li><li>Advise on when and how to seek medical advice.</li><li>Monitor the number of (and reason for) hospital admissions.</li></ul></li><li>In children, the aim is also to:<ul><li>Manage, monitor, and give support for any complications, such as stroke, lung disease, priapism, leg ulcers, gallstones, avascular necrosis, and eye complications.</li><li>Monitor general health, including absence from school.</li><li>Monitor development, nutrition, growth, and puberty.</li><li>Review nocturnal enuresis in children older than 6 years.</li><li>Document the size of the spleen.</li><li>Check blood pressure annually.</li><li>Carry out annual transcranial Doppler imaging from 3 years of age, to screen for cerebrovascular disease.</li></ul></li><li>In adults, the aim is also to:<ul><li>Monitor and give support for any <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sickle-cell-disease/background-information/complications/#chronic-complications\">chronic complications</a>.</li><li>Screen regularly for lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, retinopathy, and renal disease.</li><li>Monitor for iron overload in those on long-term blood transfusions.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Parents or carers will receive comprehensive advice on caring for children with sickle cell disease. </strong>These should be reinforced in primary care if necessary.<ul><li>Parents/carers are advised on when to seek urgent medical assistance, and taught to examine their child for pallor and an enlarging spleen.</li><li>They are also advised:<ul><li>On the importance of keeping warm, avoiding sudden changes in temperature, and avoiding dehydration (by maintaining a good fluid intake).</li><li>On the importance of adherence to <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sickle-cell-disease/management/prevention-of-complications/#antibiotic-prophylaxis\">prophylactic antibiotics</a> and the <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sickle-cell-disease/management/prevention-of-complications/#recommended-immunizations\">immunization schedule</a>.</li><li>On when to seek early medical advice, for example if the child has a fever, respiratory symptoms, signs of infection, unusual pallor, an enlarged (or enlarging) spleen, signs of stroke (weakness, tingling, or loss of speech), or painful crisis and dactylitis.</li><li>To report any concerns, for example about a child's development or any deterioration in school achievement.</li><li>To seek advice regarding any intended travel to a foreign country, so that travel immunization and malarial prophylaxis are provided.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Children will have regular psychological support.</strong><ul><li>Cognitive behaviour therapy will be considered in all children who have frequent episodes of pain.</li><li>A neuropsychological assessment, repeated annually, will be carried out on all children who have had a stroke.</li><li>Regular developmental assessment, neurophysiological screening, and monitoring of school attainment should be carried out regularly to assess for a possible silent stroke.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Elective blood transfusion may be used:</strong><ul><li>In primary or secondary stroke prevention.</li><li>During some types of elective surgery.</li><li>To manage painful crises in pregnancy.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Hydroxycarbamide is used to prevent acute chest syndrome and acute painful crises.</strong><ul><li>It promotes fetal haemoglobin synthesis; improves erythrocyte hydration; and reduces the number of painful crises, episodes of acute chest syndrome, and transfusion requirements in children and adults. It also improves long-term survival.</li><li>It is used in people who have:<ul><li>Recurrent painful crises in the community which interfere with daily living.</li><li>Been admitted with more than three episodes of acute pain over 12 months.</li><li>Had two or more episodes of acute chest syndrome.</li></ul></li><li>People taking hydroxycarbamide need regular blood monitoring and should be warned about the symptoms and signs of myelosuppression. Women should also use adequate <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sickle-cell-disease/management/contraception/#contraception\">contraception</a> whilst taking hydroxycarbamide and for 3 months after stopping because of the risk of teratogenicity. Men taking hydroxycarbamide should be advised to use safe contraceptive measures during, and for at least 3 months after, treatment.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Surgery may be considered in certain cases. </strong><ul><li>For example: <ul><li>Surgery may be used to relieve pain due to avascular necrosis. </li><li>Hip replacement surgery is necessary for late disease, but people with sickle cell disease have an increased incidence of infection and rejection of the prosthesis.</li><li>Splenectomy is recommended for people who have had two or more episodes of acute splenic sequestration.</li><li>Cholecystectomy is recommended for symptomatic biliary disease.</li></ul></li><li>People with sickle cell disease who undergo surgery are at increased risk of complications. Preoperative planning should involve the surgeon, anaesthetist, paediatrician (in children), and haematologist.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Stem cell transplantation </strong><strong>(the only cure for sickle cell disease) may be considered in children and young people.</strong><ul><li>In the UK, this procedure is recommended in people aged younger than 17 years with:<ul><li>Sickle brain disease which does not respond to hydroxycarbamide.</li><li>Severe sickle cell disease-related complications which have not responded to hydroxycarbamide.</li></ul></li><li>A matched sibling donor is needed for the procedure to be successful.</li><li>Published evidence shows a survival rate of 92–94% and a disease-free survival rate of 75–84%, following the procedure.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 2e3bada0-b1ab-4cec-b7b6-d256132e1cee --><!-- end item 728c0b80-a0a2-4778-ab88-57b636427a80 -->","subChapters":[{"id":"8e19a5fc-7cf2-52ea-80c6-edf804f9c359","slug":"basis-for-recommendation-68d","fullItemName":"Basis for recommendation","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 6ae76c14-589f-48cf-bf5f-10fcc5ace4c5 --><h4>Basis for recommendation</h4><!-- end field 6ae76c14-589f-48cf-bf5f-10fcc5ace4c5 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 68d36488-d625-4450-b516-ca5dc1309d22 --><!-- begin field 4ab58889-16b2-42b1-9314-7f4305f76cf7 --><p>This information is based on expert opinion in the guidelines <em>Sickle cell disease in childhood: standards and guidelines for clinical care</em> published by the NHS Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Screening Programme in partnership with the Sickle Cell Society [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sickle-cell-disease/references/\">PHE, 2010</a>] and <em>Standards for the clinical care of adults with sickle cell disease in the UK </em>published by the Sickle Cell Society [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sickle-cell-disease/references/\">Sickle Cell Society, 2008</a>], and in review articles on managing sickle cell disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sickle-cell-disease/references/\">Claster and Vichinsky, 2003</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sickle-cell-disease/references/\">Lucas et al, 2008</a>].</p><!-- end field 4ab58889-16b2-42b1-9314-7f4305f76cf7 --><!-- end item 68d36488-d625-4450-b516-ca5dc1309d22 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
