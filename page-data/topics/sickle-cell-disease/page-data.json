This is the most common and severe type of sickle cell disease.</li></ul></li><li>Sickle cell trait occurs when a person inherits a gene for normal haemoglobin (Hb A) from one parent and a gene for sickle cell haemoglobin from their other parent; their genotype is Hb AS.<ul><li>These people rarely have symptoms; however, they have a 50% chance of passing the sickle cell gene to their child. If both parents are carriers, there is a 1 in 4 chance that their child will be born with sickle cell disease.</li></ul></li><li>Sickle cell disease is common and affects 1 in every 2000 live births in England. </li><li>In the UK, sickle cell screening is offered to all newborn babies and all pregnant women. </li><li>Sickle cell disease should be suspected if a person is in a high-risk ethnic group (mostly African or African-Caribbean) and:<ul><li>Is a child aged 9–18 months with painful dactylitis (painful swelling of the bones of the hands and feet).

There is often a history of a previous crisis.</li><li>All people with sickle cell disease will be followed up regularly (and in some cases managed) by secondary care. However, a primary healthcare professional will be required to: <ul><li>Ensure that the person understands and adheres to the self-management advice given in secondary care, including advice on adherence to immunizations, malaria prophylaxis, and antibiotic prophylaxis, and when to seek urgent medical care.</li><li>Identify a sickle cell crisis and ensure appropriate treatment is given, including admission (if appropriate).</li><li>Provide support to people with chronic complications, such as chronic pain. </li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field a5ef8bba-31a9-4718-a45a-69b244b51378 --><!-- end item c88bf5d9-27dd-484c-8351-77857e1bdf13 -->","topic":{"id":"eb346bd0-1df2-5db2-a583-a366e34cfc19","topicId":"cc107f5d-efe6-4625-840e-5c4d4656869b","topicName":"Sickle cell disease","slug":"sickle-cell-disease","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"d2b6d668-4d29-5c50-b65d-7467cbcce2dd","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"47f9af8d-8bda-55a3-bf81-eb75a7c4f02a","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"4a0ece3e-fa44-5ecd-9f55-ac17384d960c","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"44a5b5f9-fc8e-5024-87e3-a7e42dca3dd9","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"48757ec5-731a-57fd-8e39-d2cdf918179a","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"53ae2089-f545-5b24-99c5-a9fc620ea575","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"ffff20e4-5bc5-5c3b-bb59-858dba2fcf8d","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"16f85d1d-aec7-5173-9e0b-7d9456bdf3a5","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"12a41d5f-f447-5a64-868a-7648c7de9355","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"5de2a0f3-a77d-5244-a401-dbd2cbcfefb3","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"fc893fb4-51ec-5705-8dff-c7fba1969646","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
