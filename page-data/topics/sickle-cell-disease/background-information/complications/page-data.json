This is common because conditions in the renal medulla (a hypoxic, acidotic, hypertonic environment) may promote sickling. The medullary damage results in an inability to concentrate urine, which can lead to dehydration.</li><li>Cumulative vascular damage due to sickle cells adhering to endothelial cells may damage the glomeruli and cause renal failure. Dehydration, sepsis, or drugs may precipitate acute renal failure, or it may occur during general multi-organ failure.</li><li>Some people with pre-existing chronic renal failure may develop acute renal failure.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Acute neurological complications</strong> <ul><li>Neurological complications of a sickle cell crisis may present as an acute stroke (due to subarachnoid or intracerebral bleeding or thrombosis) or as hemiparesis, speech problems, seizures, or altered consciousness.</li><li>Stroke affects more than 5% of people with sickle cell disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sickle-cell-disease/references/\">Sickle Cell Society, 2008</a>], and sickle cell disease is the most common cause of stroke in children [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sickle-cell-disease/references/\">Brousse et al, 2014</a>].</li><li>An acute stroke due to ischaemia may occur at any age but is common in children, and the incidence increases with age in adults older than 30 years of age (adults aged 20–29 years are more likely to have a subarachnoid or intracerebral haemorrhage).</li><li>People who have had an infarction are at increased risk of a haemorrhagic stroke as they get older. This is usually caused by a ruptured aneurysm, particularly in the vertebrobasilar area.</li><li>Subarachnoid haemorrhage and intracerebral haemorrhage may occur when there is acute hypertension; these two conditions are associated with recent blood transfusion, bone marrow transplantation, or corticosteroid use.  <ul></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sickle-cell-disease/references/\">Wethers, 2000</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sickle-cell-disease/references/\">Claster and Vichinsky, 2003</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sickle-cell-disease/references/\">Mehta et al, 2006</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sickle-cell-disease/references/\">Lucas et al, 2008</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sickle-cell-disease/references/\">Sickle Cell Society, 2008</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sickle-cell-disease/references/\">Weatherall, 2010</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/sickle-cell-disease/references/\">Brousse et al, 2014</a>]</p><!-- end field a0f20b9b-5158-48cd-8c5f-a6b6018245bb --><!-- end item 83c00c69-88a6-4602-a13b-a6b60182440b -->","subChapters":[]},{"id":"83831032-a54a-5812-82d1-64294270ec25","slug":"chronic-complications","fullItemName":"Chronic complications","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field c4af55cc-7558-4712-b831-a6b6018264e7 --><h3>What are the chronic complications of sickle cell disease?</h3><!-- end field c4af55cc-7558-4712-b831-a6b6018264e7 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 583b0817-e777-442d-a5b9-a6b60182630d --><!-- begin field 414d5c0a-eaaf-4870-a282-a6b6018264e7 --><ul><li><strong>Chronic complications of sickle cell disease include:</strong><ul><li><strong>Chronic pain</strong><ul><li>Pain may be due to leg ulcers, chronic arthritis, avascular necrosis of femoral or humeral heads, vetebral collapse, or chronic osteomyelitis. </li><li>Osteopenia may occur due to hyperplasia of the bone marrow, and severe and progressive hip dysfunction may occur (with abnormalities of gait and muscle wasting).</li><li>In some people, there is no obvious cause for the pain.
