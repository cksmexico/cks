A literature search was conducted in October 2011 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key RCTs published since the last revision of the topic. This identified the United Kingdom National Guideline in the Management of Phthirus pubis infestation (2007) produced by the British Association of Sexual Health and HIV. Recommendations within this guideline are consistent with the current CKS topic therefore no changes to recommendations have been made. Issued in December 2011.</p><p><strong>March 2011</strong> — topic structure revised to ensure consistency across CKS topics — no changes to clinical recommendations have been made.</p><p><strong>November 2007</strong> — minor update to text. Malathion is now licensed for a second application after 7 days. (The recommendation for a second application of insecticide 7 days after the first is unlicensed for permethrin, and is different to the information supplied by the manufacturers: their package inserts state that a single application is sufficient.) Issued in December 2007.</p><p><strong>February to May 2007</strong> — converted from CKS guidance to CKS topic structure. The evidence-base has been reviewed in detail, and recommendations are more clearly justified and transparently linked to the supporting evidence. There are no major changes to the recommendations.</p><p><strong>August 2003</strong> — reviewed. Validated in December 2003 and issued in February 2004.</p><p><strong>November 2000</strong> — rewritten. Validated in March 2001 and issued in June 2001.</p><p><strong>June 1998 </strong>— reviewed.</p><p><strong>September 1997</strong> — written.</p><!-- end field dd0f87e9-33f8-4dbe-b829-e0cf1ee475d2 --><!-- end item ed5e1838-b541-404b-b62f-1b96f70b80eb -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
