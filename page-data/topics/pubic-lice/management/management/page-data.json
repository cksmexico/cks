Percutaneous absorption of malathion is about 4% and it is rapidly destroyed by plasma cholinesterases. Percutaneous absorption of permethrin is less than 2% and it is rapidly metabolised to inactive metabolites and excreted in the urine. UKMi theorise that the amount of drug passing into milk after topical application would be too low to present a hazard to the breastfeeding infant and conclude that either malathion or permethrin topical preparations may be used to treat pubic lice infestations in breastfeeding mothers of full term, healthy infants [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pubic-lice/references/\">UKMi, 2015</a>].</li><li>Clinical guidelines from the British Association of Sexual Health and HIV [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pubic-lice/references/\">BASHH, 2007</a>], Centres for Disease Control and Prevention [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pubic-lice/references/\">CDC, 2015</a>] and the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pubic-lice/references/\">Salavastru, 2017</a>] state that permethrin can be used in pregnancy and breastfeeding.</li><li>The UK Teratology Information Service (UKTIS) has issued a monograph relating to permethrin and malathion use in treatment of scabies in pregnancy. This states that neither is licensed for use during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Available pregnancy safety data is limited and does not provide evidence that either product poses an increased risk to the foetus. It is noted that most of the data on malathion relates to environmental exposure to crop sprays and may not reflect the risks for short-term topical use. UKTIS conclude that available data for both malathion and permethrin are too limited to state that there is no risk [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pubic-lice/references/\">UKTIS, 2013</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Treatment of lice on eyelashes</h5><ul><li>Recommendations from the UK, European and North American guidelines on treatment of lice on eyelashes are conflicting:<ul><li>The Royal College of General Practitioners and British Association of Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) and European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pubic-lice/references/\">BASHH, 2007</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pubic-lice/references/\">RCGP, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pubic-lice/references/\">Salavastru, 2017</a>] guidelines state that infestation of eyelashes can be treated with permethrin 1% lotion keeping the eyes closed during the 10 minute application or alternatively, paraffin eye ointment can be used topically twice a day for 8-10 days.</li><li>The Public Health Agency of Canada [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pubic-lice/references/\">Public Health Agency of Canada, 2013</a>] and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pubic-lice/references/\">CDC, 2015</a>] state that pediculosis of the eyelashes should be treated by applying occlusive ophthalmic ointment or petroleum jelly to the eyelid margins twice a day for 10 days and should <em>not</em> be treated with permethrin, pyrethrin or lindane.</li></ul></li><li>Paraffin eye ointment is effective by suffocating adult lice and nymphs (immature lice) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pubic-lice/references/\">RCGP, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pubic-lice/references/\">Salavastru, 2017</a>].<ul><li>An inert ophthalmic ointment with a white or yellow soft paraffin base provides a suitable consistency to produce this effect.</li><li>Inert ophthalmic ointments are preferred over topical ointments that are not formulated for use in the eyes because there is no risk of adverse effects should the ointment spread to the eye.
