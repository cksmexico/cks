If objective tests cannot be done immediately, carry them out when acute symptoms have been controlled, and advise the person to seek immediate medical advice if they become unwell while waiting to have objective tests.</p><p><strong>Take a structured clinical history in people with suspected asthma, and ensure that all answers are recorded for later review. There is no single diagnostic test to confirm a diagnosis. Use clinical judgement to determine the probability of an asthma diagnosis, based on a combination of the following:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Presence of more than one variable symptom of wheeze, cough, breathlessness, and chest tightness.</strong><ul><li>Symptoms are commonly episodic, diurnal (worse at night or in the early morning), and/or triggered or exacerbated by exercise, viral infection, and exposure to cold air or allergens.</li><li>In children, symptoms may also be triggered by emotion and laughter.</li><li>In adults, symptoms may be triggered by use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and beta-blockers.</li><li>Ideally,  expiratory polyphonic wheeze (with multiple pitches and tones heard over different areas of the lung when the person breathes out) will be confirmed on auscultation. </li><li><strong>Note: </strong>Occupational asthma may be suggested by adult-onset asthma, where symptoms improve when not at work. High-risk occupations include laboratory work, baking, animal handling, welding, and paint spraying. Check for possible occupational asthma by asking:<ul><li>Are symptoms better on days away from work?</li><li>Are symptoms better when on holiday?</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Personal/family history of other atopic conditions,</strong> particularly atopic eczema/dermatitis and/or allergic rhinitis.<ul><li>Use a previous record of skin-prick tests, blood eosinophilia of 4% or more, or a raised allergen-specific IgE to corroborate atopic status, but do not offer these tests routinely to support an asthma diagnosis.</li></ul></li><li><strong>The results of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) testing</strong> — should be used where possible to confirm eosinophilic airway inflammation to support an asthma diagnosis in people aged 17 years and older. This test may be available in some primary care practices or may require referral to a specialist centre. In steroid-naive adults, a FeNO level of 40 parts per billion (ppb) or higher is considered a positive result.<ul><li>Consider FeNO testing in children and young people (aged 5 to 16 years) if there is diagnostic uncertainty after initial assessment, and they have either normal spirometry <em>or</em><strong> </strong>obstructive spirometry with a negative bronchodilator reversibility (BDR) test (see below). A FeNO level of 35ppb is considered a positive result in this group. <ul><li>Approximately 1 in 5 people with a negative result will have asthma.</li><li>Approximately 1 in 5 people with a positive result will not have asthma.</li><li>Be aware that the results of FeNO tests may be affected by empirical treatment with inhaled corticosteroids.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>The results of objective tests to detect airway obstruction, when the person is symptomatic:</strong><ul><li><strong>Spirometry</strong> should be offered to all symptomatic people over the age of five years. The FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio is normally greater than 70%. Any value less than this suggests airflow limitation. However, a normal spirometry result when the person is asymptomatic does not rule out asthma. <ul><li><strong>Note: </strong>FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC lower limit of normal (LLN) values can also be used to detect airway obstruction.</li><li>Be aware that spirometry may be affected by empirical treatment with inhaled corticosteroids.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Bronchodilator reversibility (BDR)</strong> can also help to confirm a diagnosis of asthma, and should be offered, where available, to adults (aged 17 and over), and considered in children and young people (aged 5 to 16 years) with obstructive spirometry (FEV1/FVC ratio less than 70%):<ul><li>In adults, an improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> of 12% or more, together with an increase in volume of at least 200 mL in response to beta-2 agonists or corticosteroids is regarded as a positive result. An improvement of greater than 400 mL in FEV<sub>1</sub> is strongly suggestive of asthma.</li><li>In children, an improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> of 12% or more is regarded as a positive result.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Variable peak expiratory flow (PEF) readings</strong> can support an asthma diagnosis if there is diagnostic uncertainty after initial assessment, a FeNO test, and/or objective tests to detect airway obstruction. A value of more than 20% variability after monitoring at least twice daily for 2-4 weeks is regarded as a positive result:<ul><li>In adults, offer monitoring of peak flow variability if the person has either normal spirometry, <em>or</em> obstructive spirometry and positive BDR, with a FeNO level of 39 ppb or less. Consider monitoring peak flow variability if the person has obstructive spirometry <em>and</em> negative BDR, <em>and </em>a FeNO level between 25 and 39 ppb.</li><li>In children (aged 5 to 16 years), offer monitoring of peak flow variability if they have either normal spirometry <em>or</em> obstructive spirometry, irreversible airways obstruction (negative BDR), and a FeNO level of 35 ppb or greater.</li><li>PEF variability is usually calculated as the difference between the highest and lowest readings expressed as a percentage of the average PEF.</li><li>The upper limit of the normal range is approximately 20% using at least four PEF reading per day but may be lower when using twice daily readings.</li><li>PEF charting when asthma is 'inactive' is unlikely to confirm variability.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>The results of a direct bronchial challenge test with histamine or methacholine — this test requires specialist referral. A PC20 value (provocative concentration causing a 20% drop in FEV1) of 8 mg/ml or less is regarded as a positive result.</strong><ul><li>Offer this test (where available) to adults if there is diagnostic uncertainty after normal spirometry and either a FeNO level of 40 ppb or more and no variability in peak flow readings or FeNO level of 39 ppb or less with variability in peak flow

asthma are based on expert opinion in the British Thoracic Society (BTS) and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) <em>British guideline on the management of asthma </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/asthma/references/\">BTS/SIGN, 2019</a>], the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guideline on <em>Global strategy for asthma

testing</h4><ul><li><strong>The British Thoracic Society (BTS)/Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have differing views on the importance of fractional exhaled nitric oxide testing (FeNO) in the diagnosis of asthma:</strong><ul><li>NICE states that this test should be offered to all people with suspected asthma [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/asthma/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li><li>BTS/SIGN place less prominence on this test, suggesting it as a potentially useful adjunct to other tests and observations [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/asthma/references/\">BTS/SIGN, 2019</a>]. </li><li>CKS acknowledges that in practice, FeNO testing may not always be locally available, and advises that where this is the case, combinations of the other suggested tests/observations can be used to support or refute an asthma diagnosis.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Spirometry results</h4><ul><li><strong>The British Thoracic Society (BTS)/Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) cite differing cut-off values for abnormal FEV1/FVC ratios:</strong><ul><li>BTS/SIGN recommends use of lower limits of normal (LLN) for FEV1/ FVC ratio [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/asthma/references/\">BTS/SIGN, 2019</a>]. <ul><li>The FEV1/FVC ratio changes with age. In young children it can be as high as 90%, so use of the commonly used fixed ratio of 70% will substantially underestimate airflow limitation. Conversely, in adults over 40 years, levels below 70% may be normal and use of a 70% threshold will overestimate obstruction.</li><li>From a practical perspective, the spirometers widely used in clinical practice provide the lower and upper limits of the normal range of spirometry parameters</li></ul></li><li>NICE acknowledges the advantages of using LLN (especially in children) and suggests it should be used ‘if the value is available’ though specifically suggests the fixed ratio of 70% as the threshold for proceeding to bronchodilator reversibility testing [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/asthma/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 7104fb57-aa76-440b-9f30-a6be01014b6e --><!-- end item 0671955d-4bb2-48c1-92be-a6be01014af6 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
