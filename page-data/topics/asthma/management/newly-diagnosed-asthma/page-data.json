Anyone prescribed more than one SABA per month should have their asthma control and symptoms assessed urgently and measures taken to improve their asthma control, if this is found to be poor.</li><li>For more information on prescribing a SABA, see the section <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/asthma/prescribing-information/beta-2-agonists/\">Which short-acting beta-2 agonists are available for asthma?</a></li></ul></li><li><strong>Prescribe an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) as preventer therapy for all people who:</strong><ul><li>Use an inhaled SABA three times a week or more, <em>and/or</em></li><li>Have asthma symptoms three times a week or more, <em>and/or</em></li><li>Are woken at night by asthma symptoms once weekly or more.<ul><li>In addition, an ICS should be considered for adults and children over the age of 5 years who have had an asthma attack requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids in the past two years.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Start ICS at a dose appropriate to the severity of the person's symptoms:</strong><ul><li>A reasonable starting dose is usually a low dose for adults, and a paediatric low dose for children aged 5 to 16 years. For dosages in children under the age of five years, see the advice below. The actual dosage will vary depending on the prescribed preparation, please see the section on <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/asthma/prescribing-information/inhaled-corticosteroids/\">Which inhaled corticosteroids are available for asthma?</a> for further details.</li><li>Higher doses may be required in people who are previous or current smokers as smoking reduces the effectiveness of ICS therapy.</li><li>ICS should initially be used twice daily (except ciclesonide, which is used once daily). There is little evidence of benefit from ICS dosing more than twice daily.</li><li>Adjust the dose of ICS over time, aiming for the lowest dose required for effective asthma control.</li><li>Once good control is established, once-daily ICS at the same daily dose can be considered as maintenance therapy.</li></ul></li><li><strong>If the person's asthma is not adequately controlled with low-dose ICS, consider a trial of an add-on therapy. </strong>Before initiating an add-on therapy, recheck adherence, inhaler technique, and elimination of trigger factors. The duration of the trial will depend on the desired outcome. For example, preventing nocturnal waking may require days or weeks of add-on treatment, while preventing asthma attacks or decreasing oral steroid use may require a longer trial. For more information on add-on therapies, please see the section on <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/asthma/prescribing-information/\">Prescribing information</a>.<ul><li><strong>For adults (aged 17 years and older):</strong><ul><li>Consider offering a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) in addition to the low dose ICS. Review the response to treatment in 4 to 8 weeks. Note: An LTRA is an oral therapy, taken only at night which may potentially affect adherence to the inhaled ICS therapy. Clinical judgement should therefore be used to determine whether a person is likely to adhere to treatment with a combination of inhaled ICS and oral LTRA. Where this may be problematic, consider offering a long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA) in combination with the ICS as an alternative.</li><li>If asthma is uncontrolled on a low dose of ICS and a LTRA, offer a long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA) in combination with the ICS. Use clinical judgement to decide whether to also continue treatment with the LTRA, taking into account the degree of response to LTRA treatment and the person's wishes.</li><li>If asthma is uncontrolled on a low dose of ICS and a LABA, with or without an LTRA, offer to change the person's ICS and LABA maintenance therapy to a maintenance and reliever therapy (MART) regimen with a low maintenance ICS dose. MART treatment consists of a single inhaler containing both ICS and a fast-acting LABA, which is used for both daily maintenance therapy and the relief of symptoms as required.</li><li>If asthma is uncontrolled on a MART regimen with a low maintenance ICS dose, with or without an LTRA, consider increasing the ICS to a moderate maintenance dose (either continuing on a MART regimen or changing to a fixed-dose of an ICS and a LABA, with a SABA as a reliever therapy.)</li><li>If asthma is uncontrolled on a moderate maintenance ICS dose with a LABA (either as MART or a fixed-dose regimen), with or without an LTRA, consider a trial of an additional drug (for example, a muscarinic receptor antagonist or theophylline). Alternatively, a high maintenance dose of ICS may be appropriate. Specialist supervision of high-dose ICS treatment may be advisable, depending on the experience of the prescriber. A specialist may also recommend continuous or frequent use of oral steroids (usually prednisolone) or additional steroid tablet-sparing treatments.</li></ul></li><li><strong>For children aged 5 to 16 years:</strong><ul><li>Consider offering a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) in addition to the paediatric low dose ICS, and reviewing the response to treatment in 4 to 8 weeks.</li><li>If asthma is uncontrolled on a paediatric low dose of ICS and a LTRA, consider stopping the LTRA and offering a long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA) in combination with the ICS.</li><li>If asthma is uncontrolled on a paediatric low dose of ICS and a LABA, consider changing their ICS and LABA maintenance therapy to a maintenance and reliever therapy (MART) regimen with a paediatric low maintenance ICS dose. Ensure that the child is able to understand and comply with the MART regimen.</li><li>If asthma is uncontrolled on a MART regimen with a paediatric low maintenance ICS dose, consider increasing the ICS to a paediatric moderate maintenance dose (either continuing on a MART regimen or changing to a fixed-dose of an ICS and a LABA, with a SABA as a reliever therapy).</li><li>If asthma is uncontrolled on a paediatric moderate maintenance ICS dose with LABA (either as MART or a fixed-dose regimen), consider seeking advice from a healthcare professional with expertise in asthma. Increasing the ICS dose to paediatric high maintenance dose <em>or </em>a trial of an additional drug (for example, theophylline) may be advised but are usually carried out under specialist supervision.</li><li>For children and young people aged 5 to 16 with deteriorating asthma who have not been taking their ICS consistently, explain that restarting regular use may help them to regain control of their asthma. </li><li>Additionally, include advice in their self-management programme on contacting a healthcare professional for a review if their asthma control deteriorates.</li></ul></li><li><strong>For children under the age of five years with suspected asthma:</strong><ul><li>Offer an eight week trial of a paediatric moderate dose of ICS if there are symptoms that clearly indicate the need for maintenance therapy (occurring 3 times a week or more, or causing waking at night, or uncontrolled with a SABA alone). After 8 weeks, stop ICS treatment and continue to monitor the child's symptoms. If symptoms did not resolve during the trial period, consider an <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/asthma/diagnosis/differential-diagnosis/\">alternative diagnosis</a><strong>.</strong> If symptoms resolved then reoccurred within 4 weeks of stopping ICS treatment, restart the ICS at a paediatric low dose as first-line maintenance therapy. If symptoms resolved but reoccurred beyond 4 weeks after stopping ICS treatment, repeat the 8-week trial of a paediatric moderate dose of ICS.</li><li>If suspected asthma is uncontrolled in children under 5 on a paediatric low dose of ICS as maintenance therapy, consider an LTRA in addition to the ICS.</li><li>If suspected asthma is uncontrolled in children under 5 on a paediatric low dose of ICS and an LTRA as maintenance therapy, stop the LTRA and refer the child to a healthcare professional with expertise in asthma for further investigation and management.</li><li>Note: The evidence for treatment safety and efficacy is less clear for children under the age of two years than for other age groups, and the threshold for seeking specialist opinion should, therefore be lowest in this group.</li><li>An asthma diagnosis should be confirmed when the child is old enough/able to undergo <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/asthma/diagnosis/diagnosis/\">objective tests</a>.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>If an inhaled ICS is contraindicated or not tolerated, alternative preventer medications include:</strong><ul><li>An LTRA for children under five years old.</li><li>Sodium cromoglicate, which is of some benefit in adults and is effective in children aged over five years.</li><li>Nedocromil sodium, which may be of benefit in adults and children aged over five years.</li><li>Theophyllines, which have some beneficial effect in all age groups.<ul><li>If there is doubt, seek specialist advice.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>If asthma control deteriorates:</strong><ul><li>Within a self-management programme, consider an increased dose of ICS for 7 days for children and young people (aged 5 to 16) who are using an ICS in a single inhaler. Clearly outline in the person's asthma action plan how and when to do this, and what to do if symptoms do not improve. When increasing ICS treatment:<ul><li>Consider quadrupling the regular ICS dose.</li><li>Do not exceed the maximum licensed daily dose.</li></ul></li><li>For people who report that their asthma is exacerbated by exercise, review regular treatment as this can indicate poorly-controlled asthma. In a person whose asthma is otherwise well-controlled:<ul><li>Alongside an ICS, consider use of an LTRA, a LABA, sodium cromoglicate or nedocromil sodium.</li><li>Advise use of a SABA immediately prior to exercise.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Consider decreasing maintenance therapy once a person's asthma has been controlled with their current maintenance therapy for at least 3 months.</strong><ul><li>Discuss with the person (or their family or carer if appropriate) the potential risks and benefits of decreasing maintenance therapy.</li><li>When reducing maintenance therapy:<ul><li>Stop or reduce dose of medicines in an order that takes into account the clinical effectiveness when introduced, side effects and the person's preference.</li><li>Reductions in ICS dose should be slow as people deteriorate at different rates. Dose reductions should be considered every three months, decreasing by 25-50% each time. Only consider stopping ICS treatment completely for people who are using low dose ICS alone as maintenance therapy and are symptom-free.</li><li>Review and update the person's asthma action plan accordingly.</li><li>Decide with the person (or their family or carer if appropriate) how the effects of decreasing maintenance therapy will be monitored and reviewed, including self-monitoring and a follow-up with a healthcare professional.</li><li>Specialist advice should be sought if there is uncertainty, and with a lower threshold in children.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Pregnant women should be managed in the same way as any other individual with asthma,</strong> and should be advised the importance of continuing their asthma medications (including systemic corticosteroids if applicable).</li><li><strong>For people of all ages with diagnosed or suspected asthma, consider an <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/asthma/diagnosis/differential-diagnosis/\">alternative diagnosis</a></strong> if symptom control remains poor after treatment.</li><li><strong>People with asthma should be <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/asthma/management/follow-up/#how-should-i-follow-up-a-person-with-asthma\">followed-up</a> at least annually. </strong>Closer monitoring of people with poor lung function and/or a history of an asthma attack within the last year should be considered.
