People with a moderate exacerbation may also require admission if they have factors that warrant a lower threshold for admission, such as:<ul><li>Age under 18 years.</li><li>Poor treatment adherence.</li><li>Living alone/social isolation.</li><li>Psychological problems such as depression, and alcohol or drug misuse.</li><li>Physical or learning disability.</li><li>Previous severe asthma attack.</li><li>Exacerbation despite an adequate dose of oral corticosteroids before presentation.</li><li>Presentation in the afternoon or at night.</li><li>Recent nocturnal symptoms.</li><li>Recent hospital admission.</li><li>Pregnancy.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>While awaiting admission to hospital:</strong><ul><li>Give controlled supplementary oxygen to all people with hypoxia using a face mask, Venturi mask, or nasal cannulae. Adjust flow rates as necessary to maintain an oxygen saturation of 94–98% but do not delay oxygen administration in the absence of pulse oximetry.</li><li>Treat with a short-acting beta-2 agonist:<ul><li>For life-threatening or severe asthma, give nebulized salbutamol (5 mg to all people aged over 5 years, and 2.5 mg to children aged  2–5 years).  Ideally, nebulizers should be oxygen driven (flow rate of 6 L /min usually needed) to avoid worsening hypoxia. If an oxygen-driven nebulizer is unavailable, deliver by air-driven nebulizer, although be alert that oxygen desaturation may occur. Continuous nebulization is preferred in severe obstruction, but not all nebulizer systems can do this. When using intermittent nebulization, repeat salbutamol administration every 20–30 minutes. When using a continuous nebulizer, give the dose over 30–60 minutes.</li><li>If a nebulizer is not available, or if the attack is of moderate severity, use a pressurized metered-dose inhaler with a large-volume spacer. Children under the age of three years are likely to require a face mask connected to the mouthpiece of a spacer for successful drug delivery. A short pause between puffs may be necessary to avoid hyperventilation with puffs given one at a time and inhaled with five tidal breaths. For an adult, give 4 puffs initially, followed by 2 puffs every 2 minutes according to response, up to 10 puffs. Repeat every 10-20 minutes if clinically necessary. For a child, give a puff every 30–60 seconds, up to 10 puffs. If the response is poor, give further doses while awaiting hospital admission, and switch to a nebulizer if available.</li></ul></li><li>For people with life-threatening or severe asthma, and those with a poor initial response to salbutamol, consider the addition of nebulized ipratropium bromide (500 micrograms for adults and 250 micrograms for children aged 2–12 years, do not repeat within 4 hours).</li><li>Consider advising quadrupling inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at the onset of an asthma attack. </li><li>For those people who are suitable for quadrupled ICS give the first dose of a course of prednisolone (40–50 mg for adults, 30–40 mg for children over 5 years, 20 mg for children aged 2–5 years, and 10 mg for children aged under 2 years). If medication cannot be swallowed, consider intramuscular methylprednisolone 160 mg as an alternative in adults, or IV hydrocortisone 100 mg in people aged over 5 years, and 50 mg in children aged 2–5 years.</li><li>Monitor peak expiratory flow rate (if the person can comply) and oxygen saturation (if available) to assess response to treatment.</li></ul></li><li><strong>If the person does not require hospital admission:</strong><ul><li>Use a short-acting beta-2 agonist via a large-volume spacer to relieve acute symptoms. For an adult, give 4 puffs initially, followed by 2 puffs every 2 minutes according to response, up to 10 puffs. For a child, give a puff every 30–60 seconds, up to 10 puffs. Each puff should be given one at a time and inhaled with five tidal breaths. Repeat every 10–20 minutes according to clinical response.</li><li>Consider advising quadrupling inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) at the onset of an asthma attack and for up to 14 days in order to reduce the risk of needing prescribed oral steroids.<br>• Consider adherence before recommending increasing ICS as patients who are highly adherent (>90%) may have a ceiling effect and gain no additional benefit from increasing ICS at the onset of an attack.<br>• Weigh the benefit versus risk of recommending quadrupling ICS at the start of an asthma attack in people already on high dose ICS, especially if they are experiencing frequent attacks and/or are still requiring oral steroids. For people on fixed-dose combination inhalers, increasing the dose of ICS may best be achieved by adding a single ICS inhaler.</li><li>For those people who are not suitable for increased ICS dosing consider prescribing a short course of oral prednisolone. For further details including doses, see the section <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/asthma/prescribing-information/oral-corticosteroids/\">Which oral corticosteroids are used to treat asthma?</a>.</li><li>Do not prescribe antibiotics routinely, unless symptoms and signs suggest a bacterial infection.

Follow-up all people admitted to hospital within 2 working days of discharge.</strong><ul><li>Review symptoms and check peak expiratory flow.</li><li>Check inhaler technique.</li><li>Consider stepping-up treatment by increasing inhaled corticosteroids (if they have not already increased their ICS dose) or adding in new preventive therapy.</li><li>Address potentially preventable contributors to the exacerbation, such as exposure to trigger factors and non-compliance with treatment.</li><li>Provide advice on lifestyle, vaccinations, diet, exercise, and smoking. If the person or parent/carer of the child smokes, advise them to stop.</li><li>Advise on recognizing poor asthma control (worsening symptoms or peak flow readings), early signs of an exacerbation (sudden persistent worsening symptoms), what to do at the early signs of an exacerbation (increasing beta-2 agonist and starting oral corticosteroids), and seeking medical help if symptoms are not controlled.</li><li>Consider prescribing a supply of oral corticosteroids for the person to keep at home and provide written information advising the person to start taking them during early signs of an exacerbation, and to contact a primary healthcare professional if they start treatment or are uncertain about whether to start treatment.</li><li>Ensure that the person has received self-management education and a <a href=\"https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/manage-your-asthma/action-plan/\" data-hyperlink-id=\"7564fe20-4cc1-4d95-b294-a8f7015ccd02\">personalised asthma action plan</a>.</li><li>For people over the age of 18 years with a history of asthma attacks, who are not well-controlled with either medium dose ICS or a combination ICS/LABA inhaler, a combined LABA/ICS can be used as reliever therapy when required, in addition to a regular preventer.
