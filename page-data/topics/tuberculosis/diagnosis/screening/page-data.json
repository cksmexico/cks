It notes that active case-finding, if targeted on appropriate groups or subgroups, should have a yield substantially above that found by chance screening [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>]. This is supported by the PHE publication on TB screening [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">PHE, 2018c</a>].<ul><li>NICE recommends targeted TB programmes of active case-finding in areas of identified need including major urban centres with a high incidence of TB, for high-risk and under-served groups. This may lead to earlier TB diagnosis, more successful treatment, reduced transmission to others, and reduced rates of drug resistance.</li><li>This is supported by expert opinion in a review article which states that targeted screening of high-risk groups is recommended, as more widespread routine screening leads to false positive results, creates anxiety, and is not cost-effective [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Hartman-Adams, 2014</a>].</li><li>In London, the 'Find and Treat' model, for example, has promoted active case-finding of pulmonary TB using mobile X-ray units and symptom enquiry for high-risk groups whose access to services and ability to engage with treatment is complicated by homelessness and other complex social problems. This programme helps early TB diagnosis and supports people to complete treatment courses, as well as addressing lifestyle factors that put people at increased risk of TB [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">PHE, 2016</a>].</li><li>A PHE publication notes that the majority of active cases of TB diagnosed in England are a result of reactivation of latent TB rather than infection arising from person-to-person transmission, and hence identification and treatment of people with latent disease should be a priority, particularly in areas of high TB prevalence, such as London [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">PHE, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li><li>Additional information on active case-finding in high-prevalence settings is based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Dheda, 2016</a>].</li></ul><h4>Information on contact tracing</h4><ul><li>The information on contact tracing is based on the NICE clinical guideline, which based its recommendations on variable-quality evidence, an original health economic model, and the experience and expertise of the guideline development group [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>].</li><li>These recommendations are in line with the PHE publication on TB screening [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">PHE, 2018c</a>], the ERS/ECDC Statement on TB care [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Migliori, 2018</a>], and the BHIVA guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Bracchi, 2018</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in review articles state that early identification and treatment of all close contacts of people with active TB should reduce morbidity and the risk of transmission [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Dheda, 2016</a>]. Reactivated TB is contagious, so identifying and eradicating latent TB infection by screening high-risk contacts is key to TB control and to reduce the risk of outbreaks [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Behr, 2018</a>].</li><li>The risk of a contact acquiring TB infection depends on the nature and duration of their exposure. Most people with active TB are infectious for about 2 weeks after starting TB drug treatment, provided they fully complete the treatment regimen and they have drug-sensitive TB [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Fitzgerald et al, 2010</a>].</li></ul><h4>Screening for immunocompromised people</h4><ul><li>The information on screening of high-risk groups such as immunocompromised people with HIV is based on expert opinion in the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>], the ERS/ECDC Statement [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Migliori, 2018</a>], PHE guidance on screening [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">PHE, 2018c</a>], the BHIVA guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Bracchi, 2018</a>], and the CHIVA publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Whittaker, 2015</a>].<ul><li>The NICE recommendations are based on variable-quality evidence, an original health economic model, and the experience and expertise of the guideline development group. They recommend people who are immunocompromised should have a risk assessment to determine whether screening for latent TB should be offered, based on their degree of immunocompromise, risk of progression to active TB, and presence of other risk factors for TB infection.</li><li>These recommendations are in line with the ERS/ECDC Statement on TB care.</li><li>The BHIVA publication recommends testing adults with HIV from low-incidence countries, such as the UK, for latent TB infection only if they have additional TB risk factors, as it states that testing all people with HIV for latent TB is unlikely to be cost-effective in the UK.</li><li>The CHIVA publication recommends all children with a new presentation of HIV are screened for TB, and further symptom-based screening should be performed at each specialist clinical review.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendations on the need for TB screening before starting anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha biologic drug treatment is based on the BTS and BSR guidelines, which state biologic drugs increase the risk of active TB and reactivation of latent TB infection. The risk varies with the different agents used [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">British Thoracic Society, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Holroyd, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h4>Screening for new entrants to the UK</h4><ul><li>The recommendations on TB screening for new entrants to the UK who have not had pre-entry screening are based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>] and the PHE publication on latent TB testing and treatment for migrants [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">PHE, 2015b</a>].</li><li>The information on pre-entry screening for active TB is based on the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>] and the PHE publication on screening [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">PHE, 2018c</a>].<ul><li>Pre-entry screening aims to ensure that UK visa applicants are tested and treated for pulmonary TB prior to their arrival in the UK from high TB prevalence countries. It is noted that pre-entry screening only detects active pulmonary disease at the time of screening, and will not identify new cases of TB resulting from reactivation of latent TB after migrants have settled in the UK.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Screening for new NHS employees who will be working with patients or clinical specimens</h4><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the NICE clinical guideline, which aims to prevent infection in high-risk settings [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>].<ul><li>Health checks for new NHS employees should include documentary evidence of TB Mantoux skin (or interferon-gamma release assay [IGRA]) testing within the past 5 years and/or a Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) scar check by an occupational health professional.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Management of untreated fibrotic lesions on chest X-ray</h4><ul><li>The recommendation to urgently refer people with evidence of TB scarring or untreated fibrotic lesions on chest X-ray and a history of incomplete TB treatment is based on expert opinion in a review article that TB screening as part of active case-finding is needed [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Dheda, 2016</a>]. Similarly, a review article states that healed fibrotic changes on chest X-ray (that are otherwise unexplained) may indicate past TB infection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Hartman-Adams, 2014</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field c48ac9c4-ef3b-4e9c-8ee1-867f8ed693a3 --><!-- end item b870b173-2ef5-4118-bb8c-ad4ef55e4977 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
