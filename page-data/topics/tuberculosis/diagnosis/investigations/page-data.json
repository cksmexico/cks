Prevention, diagnosis, management and service organisation</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>], the European Respiratory Society (ERS)/European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) Statement <em>European Union standards for tuberculosis care, 2017 update</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Migliori, 2018</a>], the British HIV Association (BHIVA) <em>Guidelines for the management of tuberculosis in adults living with HIV 2018</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Bracchi, 2018</a>], the Children's HIV Association (CHIVA) publication <em>HIV-Tuberculosis co-infection in children</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Whittaker, 2015</a>], a Public Health England (PHE) annual report [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">PHE, 2018a</a>], expert opinion in review articles on TB [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Dheda, 2016</a>] and on TB and HIV co-infection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Getahun et al, 2007</a>], and expert opinion in an infectious diseases textbook [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Fitzgerald et al, 2010</a>] and the Oxford Textbook of Medicine [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Chaisson and Nachega, 2010</a>].</p><h4>Investigations for suspected active pulmonary TB</h4><ul><li>The NICE clinical guideline recommends arranging an initial chest X-ray and then further diagnostic investigations if chest X-ray appearances suggest TB infection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>].<ul><li>NICE notes that sputum culture and microscopy is current practice for diagnosing active pulmonary TB in people with suspected disease, and chest X-ray is also part of the 'standard battery of tests'. NICE did not find any data investigating the use of chest X-ray alone for the diagnosis of active pulmonary TB, and the guideline development group felt that this was a useful initial test if TB is suspected to identify the presence and extent of active disease.<ul><li>The guideline development group noted, however, that chest X-ray may appear normal in people who are immunocompromised with active TB. This is supported by expert opinion in the CHIVA and BHIVA guidelines, that people who are immunocompromised and children with active TB are more likely to have non-specific or no signs on chest X-ray [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Whittaker, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Bracchi, 2018</a>].</li><li>It also noted that chest X-ray may also show signs of past rather than active infection, and concluded that a suspicious chest X-ray should lead to additional tests, especially microbiological investigations.</li></ul></li><li>A NICE evidence review found that sputum smear microscopy did not meet the minimum agreed threshold for sensitivity as a standalone test, but noted that results are available much more rapidly than sputum culture, and concluded that microscopy is a useful investigation alongside other tests.</li></ul></li><li>The ERS/ECDC Statement recommends that if pulmonary TB is suspected, all people should have at least two sputum samples sent for microscopy, molecular tests, culture, species identification, and drug-sensitivity testing, and at least one sample should be obtained in the early morning. The collection of a third sputum sample has been shown to increase the diagnostic yield by 2–3%. Chest X-rays may also be used to establish a diagnosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Migliori, 2018</a>].<ul><li>The best diagnostic sputum specimen is an early morning sample, as the bacterial load is theorized to be greater at this time of collection. Three samples are usually recommended due to the greater sensitivity of three results compared with taking fewer samples [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Fitzgerald et al, 2010</a>]. Sputum microscopy will detect acid-fast bacilli (smear-positive result) within 24–48 hours, however sputum culture (considered the 'gold standard' test for active pulmonary TB) may take up to 6 weeks. Microscopy will not distinguish between different Mycobacteria strains, or between active or latent infection, unlike culture results [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Chaisson and Nachega, 2010</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The NICE clinical guideline states that induced sputum or gastric lavage samples may be needed in children and young people [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>].<ul><li>This is supported by the CHIVA publication that states that children are less likely to be able to spontaneously expectorate sputum, and are likely to need specialist induced sputum, gastric washings, or bronchoscopy and lavage to aid diagnosis. In addition, specialist investigations such as CT chest may be used in the diagnosis of active TB to clarify the extent and severity of disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Whittaker, 2015</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Investigations for suspected active extrapulmonary TB</h4><ul><li>The recommendation to arrange a chest X-ray and respiratory sample if there is suspected extrapulmonary TB is based on the need to exclude or confirm co-existing pulmonary TB infection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Whittaker, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>].<ul><li>In 2017, 22.8% of people notified with pulmonary TB also had extrapulmonary disease in at least one additional site [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">PHE, 2018a</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The recommendations on additional investigations are largely based on expert opinion in the NICE clinical guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">NICE, 2016</a>], the ERS/ECDC Statement [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Migliori, 2018</a>], the CHIVA publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Whittaker, 2015</a>], and expert opinion in an infectious diseases textbook [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Fitzgerald et al, 2010</a>].<ul><li>NICE states that people with suspected extrapulmonary disease will often require specialist investigations following referral, depending on the likely site(s) of involvement.</li><li>The ERS/ECDC Statement recommends that for all people with suspected extrapulmonary TB infection, appropriate specimens from the suspected sites of involvement should be obtained for microbiological testing (microscopy, molecular tests, culture, species identification, and drug-sensitivity testing) and histopathological examination following biopsy or needle aspiration.</li><li>The CHIVA publication states that additional specialist investigations such as abdominal ultrasound may be helpful to identify hepatosplenomegaly and/or lymphadenopathy.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Possible false negative results</h4><ul><li>The information on possible false negative test results in people who are immunocompromised is based on the BHIVA guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Bracchi, 2018</a>]  and expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Getahun et al, 2007</a>].<ul><li>People with HIV may present with atypical symptoms and signs, chest X-ray appearances may be normal or have non-specific changes, and their sputum may be smear-negative but culture positive [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Bracchi, 2018</a>].</li></ul></li><li>Expert opinion in a review article states that spontaneously expectorated sputum is inadequate in about one-third of cases of TB, particularly in children and people with HIV co-infection. This may be compounded by poor quality sputum samples or insufficient sputum volumes, or inability to obtain sputum [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Dheda, 2016</a>].</li><li>The CHIVA publication notes that chest X-ray changes may be non-specific and less well defined in children and people with HIV [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">Whittaker, 2015</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field 8d5e6096-f3df-4279-aac1-03979a027e2a --><!-- end item 8657033f-cc78-4440-9b67-5614d6c9ae21 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
