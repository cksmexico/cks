2 months with pyrazinamide and ethambutol. Treatment success is usually defined by completion of therapy with negative follow-up sputum smears. People with active TB of the central nervous system require a prolonged treatment regimen. Drug susceptibility testing may result in the modification of treatment regimens.</li><li>Treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB — this is more complex than standard treatment, often involving prolonged treatment (for 18–24 months) with at least six drugs to which the mycobacterium is likely to be sensitive. Treatment is often less efficacious and more poorly tolerated due to increased adverse effects.</li><li>Surgical management of MDR and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB — candidates for surgery may include people with potentially resectable unilateral disease (or apical bilateral disease in selected cases), with adequate lung function who have not responded to medical treatment.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Care should be co-ordinated through the local multidisciplinary TB team including a key worker</strong> to support and encourage the person to complete treatment successfully, monitor adherence to treatment, check clinical response, and identify any adverse effects.

It is also pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be safe clinical practice.</li></ul><h5>Specialist assessment and management of confirmed TB</h5><ul><li>The requirement to notify new cases of suspected or active TB that meet specific criteria is based on the PHE publication on notifying TB cases [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/tuberculosis/references/\">PHE, 2014</a>].<ul><li>Notification allows for a timely risk assessment of cases and their contacts by clinical and public health teams.

In addition, individual case plans are designed to help recognise and manage adverse effects from treatment and provide psychosocial support.
