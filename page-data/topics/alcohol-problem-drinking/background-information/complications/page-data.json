For all ages it is the fifth most important.</strong><ul><li>Up to 17 million working days are lost annually through absences caused by drinking; up to 20 million are lost through loss of employment or reduced employment opportunities.</li><li>Between 2002 and 2012 in England, the number of episodes where an alcohol-related disease, injury, or condition was the primary reason for hospital admission or a secondary diagnosis doubled.</li><li>In England and Wales in 2012, 1.4% of all deaths were alcohol-related. Globally, up to 6% of deaths are attributable to alcohol consumption.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Specific health complications relating to alcohol misuse include:</strong><ul><li><strong>Short term harm — death and illness from accident and injury, drowning, alcohol poisoning, and self-harm related to alcohol.</strong><ul><li>Drinking five UK units on a single occasion more than doubles the relative risk of an injury in the six hours afterwards, and this relative risk rises even more rapidly when higher levels are consumed.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Long term harm — death and illness from:</strong><ul><li><strong>Cancer </strong>(such as mouth, throat, bowel, stomach, liver, and breast cancer). For female breast cancer, relative risks of both illness and death from the disease increase by 16% if drinking regularly at 2 units per day and by 40% if drinking regularly at 5 units per day. The lifetime risk of bowel cancer in men who drink at least 35 units weekly is almost double that of men who do not drink alcohol.</li><li><strong>Heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, hypertensive disease</strong>. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy is characterised by cardiomegaly, disruptions of myofibrillary architecture, reduced myocardial contractility, decreased ejection fraction, and enhanced risk of stroke and hypertension. For cardiac arrhythmias in men, relative risks of illness and death from the disease increase by 13% if drinking regularly at 2 units per day and by 34% if drinking regularly at 5 units per day.</li><li><strong>Liver disease, pancreatitis. </strong>Alcohol accounts for over a third of all cases of liver disease. The three conditions most associated with alcohol use are fatty liver (steatosis), hepatitis (acute and chronic), and cirrhosis. These conditions can occur separately or concurrently. Women drinkers are at higher risk of developing of alcohol-related liver disease due to decreased metabolism of alcohol. Alcoholic cirrhosis is associated with a significant increase in risk of death due to bleeding oesophageal varices, infection, renal failure, and/or hepatic failure. For cirrhosis of the liver in men, relative risks of death from the disease increase by 57% if drinking regularly at 2 units per day and by 207% if drinking regularly at 5 units per day. </li><li><strong>Psychiatric illness.</strong> An estimated 44% of community mental health patients report problem drug use or harmful alcohol use in the previous year. The National confidential inquiry into suicide and homicide by people with mental illness found that there was a history of alcohol misuse in 45% of suicides among the patient population during period 2002 to 2011.</li><li><strong>Wernicke's encephalopathy.</strong> Alcohol-use disorder is often associated with a thiamine deficiency which, if severe, may lead to Wernicke's encephalopathy. This is characterised by ocular motility disorders, ataxia, and confusion. When people with Wernicke's encephalopathy are inappropriately treated with low doses of thiamine, mortality rates average about 20% and Korsakoff's psychosis develops in about 85% of survivors. Korsakoff's psychosis is characterised by anterograde and retrograde amnesia, disorientation, and confabulation. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Alcohol consumption during pregnancy can adversely affect the fetus: </strong><ul><li>Fetal alcohol exposure can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, and intrauterine growth restriction.</li><li>Heavy drinking during pregnancy (repeatedly consuming more than around five units per day), can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Some of the features of FASD may not be obvious at birth and may only become apparent when the child starts school, or later on in life.  Features of FASD include:<ul><li>Malformations of the heart, skull, kidneys, limbs, bones, brain, and other organs.</li><li>Dysmorphic facial features (small eyes, thin upper lip, poorly defined filtrum).</li><li>Problems with eyesight and hearing.</li><li>Fetal growth restriction and poor growth throughout life.</li><li>Microcephaly, developmental problems which can range from mild to severe.</li></ul></li><li>Studies of lower levels of consumption are equivocal with regards to the risk of fetal harm, and the Department of Health, therefore, recommends that pregnant women avoid alcohol completely.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Social complications relating to alcohol misuse include family conflict and domestic violence and abuse.</strong><ul><li>Alcohol plays a part in 25% to 33% of known cases of child abuse.</li><li>In a study of four London boroughs, almost two-thirds of all children subject to care proceedings had parents who misused substances including alcohol.</li><li>In a study of young offending cases where the young person was also misusing alcohol, 78% had a history of parental alcohol abuse or domestic abuse within the family.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/alcohol-problem-drinking/references/\">UKTIS, 2011</a>;
