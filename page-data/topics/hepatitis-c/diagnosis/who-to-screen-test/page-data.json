class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/references/\">Spearman, 2019</a>].</p><h4>Why screening is important</h4><ul><li>Hepatitis C is often a silent infection, and testing and identification of infection can allow prompt antiviral treatment, if appropriate. Additional benefits of diagnosis include being able to provide information to the person to reduce the risk of disease progression, and to reduce the risk of transmission to others [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/references/\">SIGN, 2013</a>].</li><li>In May 2016, the UK signed up to the World Health Assembly’s Global Health Sector Strategy on Viral Hepatitis. This strategy introduced the first ever global targets for viral hepatitis control, including a 30% reduction in new cases of hepatitis B and C by 2020 and a 10% reduction in mortality [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/references/\">PHE, 2019b</a>], and reducing the incidence of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in England by 80% and HCV mortality by 65% by 2030 at the latest [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/references/\">PHE, 2019a</a>]. Increased diagnosis and treatment is essential to achieve these targets [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/references/\">Spearman, 2019</a>].</li><li>Diagnostic tests for hepatitis C are used to establish a clinical diagnosis, prevent infection through screening of donor blood, and make decisions regarding medical management of the person [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/references/\">Ahmad, 2017</a>].</li></ul><h4>Offering and considering hepatitis C screening</h4><ul><li>These recommendations are largely based on the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/references/\">NICE, 2013</a>] and the WHO publications [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/references/\">WHO, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/references/\">WHO, 2019</a>]. The need for regular hepatitis C testing for people who inject drugs and other people at risk is documented in <em>Shooting up: infections among people who inject drugs in the UK, 2018 — An update, December 2019 </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/references/\">PHE, 2019c</a>].</li><li>These recommendations reflect the <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/background-information/transmission/\">mode of transmission</a> of the HCV virus.</li></ul><h4>Pregnant women</h4><ul><li>According to the UK National Screening Committee (NSC) recommendation on hepatitis C screening in pregnancy, routine screening is not recommended because it is not known [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/references/\">PHE, 2018c</a>]:<ul><li>How many pregnant women in the UK have hepatitis C.</li><li>Why some mothers pass the virus to their child and others do not.</li><li>How accurate screening tests are for hepatitis C in pregnant women.</li><li>How effective treatments for hepatitis C would be for pregnant women and their children.</li><li>If treatments would prevent unborn babies from catching hepatitis from their mother.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 54a205b9-07c1-4ab0-9eae-488a38e3a400 --><!-- end item fd93610c-b3ef-4c89-9122-cac45e7a46aa -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
