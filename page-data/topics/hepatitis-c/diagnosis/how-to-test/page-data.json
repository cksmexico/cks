href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/references/\">WHO, 2019</a>]; the Public Health England (PHE) guidelines <em>UK standards for microbiology investigations: screening for hepatitis C infection</em> [<a

href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/references/\">SIGN, 2013</a>].<ul><li>Routine laboratory diagnosis of established infection is based upon the detection of antibodies for the virus using serological methods, followed by the detection of the virus using nucleic acid amplification testing or antigen testing to confirm viraemia [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/references/\">PHE, 2017a</a>].</li><li>HCV infection is diagnosed by testing for anti-HCV antibodies with a serological test, which identifies people who have ever been infected with the virus. If the test is positive, a nucleic acid test for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) is needed to confirm chronic infection because 15–45% of people infected with HCV spontaneously clear the infection by a strong immune response without the need for treatment. Although no longer infected, they will still test positive for anti-HCV antibodies [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/references/\">WHO, 2019</a>].</li><li>The anti-HCV antibody can first be detected between 5–12 weeks after an acute infection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/references/\">PHE, 2018a</a>]. However, the appearance of HCV antibodies may be significantly delayed or absent in immunocompromized people (for example with HIV infection) or in early acute HCV infection. In these cases HCV RNA detection is needed to diagnose active hepatitis C infection; HCV RNA can be detected as early as 1–2 weeks after acute infection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/references/\">SIGN, 2013</a>].</li><li>Chronic infection is identified by the persistence of HCV RNA in the blood for 6 months or longer, the rate of liver disease progression is variable and can take many decades, depending on the presence of co-factors [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/references/\">PHE, 2018a</a>]. Testing for re-infection therefore requires HCV RNA [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/references/\">PHE, 2018a</a>].</li><li>NICE recommends annual testing for hepatitis C to people who test negative for hepatitis C but remain at increased risk of infection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/references/\">NICE, 2013</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Occupational exposure to HCV</h4><ul><li>The recommendations on what to test for if there has been suspected occupational exposure to HCV are based on the SIGN guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-c/references/\">SIGN, 2013</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field 954577f6-a810-4c0c-929d-b2ca6226dc80 --><!-- end item 7739d011-5db7-41cb-89ff-d2c1403a250c -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
