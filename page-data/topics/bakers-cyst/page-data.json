History and examination may be sufficient to confirm the diagnosis in adults.</li></ul></li><li>Management in children involves:<ul><li>Arranging admission to paediatrics or accident and emergency for urgent assessment if a serious alternative diagnosis (such as DVT) is suspected.</li><li>Reassuring the child (and the parents or carers) that primary Baker's cysts usually resolve without treatment, if no underlying disease is suspected, and the diagnosis is confirmed on ultrasound scan.</li><li>Referral to a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon or paediatric rheumatologist if symptoms are troublesome; the cyst is very large; underlying joint disease is suspected; or if the diagnosis is unclear.</li></ul></li><li>Management in adults involves:<ul><li>Arranging same-day assessment in secondary care if a serious alternative diagnosis, such as DVT, is suspected.</li><li>Identifying and optimizing management of any underlying conditions, such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.</li><li>Advising the person that no treatment is required if the cyst is asymptomatic and that Baker's cysts may resolve when any underlying condition is treated.</li><li>Consideration of simple analgesia (such as paracetamol or ibuprofen) and physiotherapy if symptoms are troublesome.</li><li>Referral to a rheumatologist or orthopaedic surgeon if the diagnosis is unclear;
