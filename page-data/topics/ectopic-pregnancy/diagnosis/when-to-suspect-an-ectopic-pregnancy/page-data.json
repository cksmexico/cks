href=\"/topics/ectopic-pregnancy/references/\">NICE, 2012</a>].</p><h4>Symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy</h4><ul><li>The symptoms suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy are based on moderate- and low-quality evidence from 29 studies (24 retrospective case series, four prospective observational studies, and one case control study) reviewed by the NICE guideline development group (GDG) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/ectopic-pregnancy/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2012</a>]. <ul><li>Most women presented with:<ul><li>Abdominal or pelvic pain (93%, 21 studies).</li><li>Amenorrhoea (73%, 11 studies).</li><li>Vaginal bleeding (64%, 25 studies).</li></ul></li><li>Less common symptoms included:<ul><li>In 20–30% of women — breast tenderness (three low-quality studies), gastro-intestinal symptoms (10 studies), dizziness, fainting, or syncope (12 studies).</li><li>In 10–20% of women — shoulder tip pain (seven studies) and urinary symptoms (three low-quality studies).</li><li>In less than 10% of women — passage of tissue (two studies) and rectal pressure or pain on defecation (three low-quality studies).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>The information on when symptoms generally appear is based on a British Medical Journal (BMJ) Best Practice review article on ectopic pregnancy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/ectopic-pregnancy/references/\">BMJ, 2017</a>].</li></ul><h4>Risk factors</h4><ul><li>The NICE GDG recognized that risk factors were not a helpful method for identifying women with an ectopic pregnancy, as about a third of women with an ectopic pregnancy have no identifiable risk factors [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/ectopic-pregnancy/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2012</a>]. </li><li>The GDG agreed that risk factors should not be used as a diagnostic aid and that even if there are no identifiable risk factors, the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy should always be ruled out [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/ectopic-pregnancy/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2012</a>]. </li></ul><h4>Confirming pregnancy with a pregnancy test</h4><ul><li>The NICE GDG<em> </em>recognized that women who have an ectopic pregnancy may present with a wide variety of non-specific symptoms and signs and therefore recommends that healthcare professionals should always consider the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy in women of reproductive age, and think about offering a pregnancy test even when symptoms are non-specific [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/ectopic-pregnancy/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2012</a>].</li></ul><h4>Signs of an ectopic pregnancy</h4><ul><li>The signs suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy are based on moderate- and low-quality evidence from 29 studies (24 retrospective case series, four prospective observational studies, and one case control study) reviewed by the NICE GDG [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/ectopic-pregnancy/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2012</a>]. <ul><li>Most women with an ectopic pregnancy had at least one of the following:<ul><li>Pelvic tenderness (91%, one study).</li><li>Adnexal tenderness (82%, seven studies).</li><li>Abdominal tenderness (78%, 11 studies).</li></ul></li><li>Other important but less common signs included:<ul><li>In 40–75% of women — cervical motion tenderness (eight studies) and rebound tenderness or peritoneal signs (nine studies).</li><li>In 20–40% of women — abdominal distension (two low-quality studies), an enlarged uterus (six studies), an adnexal mass (nine studies), and tachycardia or hypotension (five low-quality studies).</li><li>In less than 20% of women — a palpable pelvic mass (two studies), collapse or shock (eight studies), or orthostatic hypotension (three studies).</li></ul></li><li>Although reported in the evidence, the NICE GDG felt that it was not appropriate to include ‘adnexal mass’ or ‘palpable pelvic mass’ in the list of symptoms and signs. From their clinical experience, they noted that palpation can increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy rupturing. They also felt that palpation to detect an internal mass is no longer appropriate due to the development of new diagnostic modalities (such as transvaginal ultrasound and biochemical tests).</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Being alert for the clinical features of tubal rupture and intra-abdominal bleeding</h4><ul><li>The Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE) recommends that ectopic pregnancy should be ruled out in women who present with abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and vomiting.
