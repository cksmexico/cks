There is no diagnostic gold standard for neglect and therefore decision-making can be very difficult and thresholds hard to establish. Also be aware that it may be difficult to distinguish between neglect and material poverty. However, care should be taken to balance recognition of the constraints on the parents' or carers' ability to meet their children's needs for food, clothing and shelter with an appreciation of how people in similar circumstances have been able to meet those needs. It is essential to place the child or young person at the centre of the assessment.</li><li><strong><em>Suspect </em>neglect</strong> <strong>if: </strong><ul><li>A child is persistently dirty and smelly.</li><li>There are repeated observations/reports of a poor standard of home hygiene that affects a child's health, inadequate provision of food, and/or a living environment that is unsafe for the child's developmental stage.</li><li>Parents or carers fail to seek medical advice for their child to the extent that the child's health and wellbeing are compromised, including if the child is in ongoing pain.</li></ul></li><li><strong><em>Consider </em>neglect if :</strong><ul><li>A<strong> </strong>child has severe and persistent infestations, such as scabies or head lice.</li><li>A child's clothing or footwear is consistently inappropriate (for example, for the weather or the child's size).</li><li>A child displays faltering growth because of lack of provision of an adequate or appropriate diet.</li><li>Parents or carers persistently fail to anticipate dangers and to take precautions to protect their child from harm. </li><li>The explanation for an injury or incident (for example, a burn, sunburn, ingestion of a harmful substance, animal bite, or a non-fatal submersion incident) suggests a lack of appropriate supervision.</li><li>A child or young person is not being cared for by a person who is able to provide adequate care.</li><li>Parents or carers fail to administer essential prescribed treatment for their child, repeatedly fail to bring their child to follow-up appointments that are essential for their child's health and wellbeing, and/or persistently fail to engage with relevant child health promotion programmes, which include immunisation, health and development reviews, and screening.</li><li>Parents or carers have access to, but persistently fail to obtain treatment for their child's dental caries.</li><li>A child's behaviour towards their parent or carer shows any of the following, particularly if they are not observed in the child's other interactions:<ul><li>Dislike or lack of cooperation.</li><li>Lack of interest or low responsiveness.</li><li>High levels of anger or annoyance.</li><li>Passivity or withdrawal.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field d691934e-9ea9-420a-baed-ffa5383140b6 --><!-- end item cc866b9c-657c-4627-a23e-5edd91d95f28 -->","topic":{"id":"399c706c-d925-5357-8bd0-fb82cd95ee01","topicId":"7e199db4-11c4-42e5-8f2d-878014e6b1ee","topicName":"Child maltreatment -
