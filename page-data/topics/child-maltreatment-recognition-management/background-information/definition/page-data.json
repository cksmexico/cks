This could include failing to provide adequate supervision, food, clothing, or shelter; or failing to protect them from physical or emotional harm.</li><li><strong>Emotional abuse</strong> — persistent maltreatment which results in adverse effects on a child's/young person's emotional, behavioural, social or cognitive development. This could include conveying to a child/young person that they are worthless, unloved, inadequate, or a burden. It could also include expectations beyond a child's/young person's developmental age, overprotection, limiting of exploration and learning, and disregarding the child's individuality.</li><li><strong>Sexual abuse</strong> — involves forcing or tempting a child/young person to take part in sexual activities, which can include prostitution. The child/young person may or may not be aware of it. The activities could include physical contact (including penetrative or non-penetrative acts), but could also involve non-contact activities such as involving a child/young person in the production of, or looking at, online sexual images, or encouraging them to behave in sexually inappropriate ways.</li><li><strong>Physical abuse </strong>— involves causing physical harm to a child/young person which may include shaking, hitting, throwing, poisoning, burning or scalding, drowning, or suffocating. Fabrication of symptoms or deliberate induction of illness in a child/young person by the parent/carer may also cause physical harm to the child/young person.</li><li><strong>Fabricated or induced illness </strong>— the misrepresentation of the child/young person as ill by the caregiver by fabricating or inducing symptoms. The motivation is usually to obtain emotional or psychological benefit for the caregiver.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Other definitions and frameworks relevant to child maltreatment include:</strong><ul><li><strong>Child safeguarding, </strong>defined as:<ul><li>Protecting children/young people from maltreatment.</li><li>Protecting children/young people from experiences that could impair their health or development.</li><li>Ensuring that children/young people are growing up in an environment that is consistent with safe and effective care.</li><li>Taking action to ensure that all children/young people have the best outcomes.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Child protection</strong> — an activity undertaken to protect specific children/young people who are suffering or who are likely to suffer significant harm, and forms part of child safeguarding.</li><li><strong>Child Protection Plan </strong>— the decision to make a child subject to a Child Protection Plan is taken if the child is at continuing risk of significant harm. A Child Protection Plan should:<ul><li>Assess the likelihood of the child suffering harm and look at ways to protect the child.</li><li>Decide on long- and short-term goals to reduce the risk of harm and protect the child.</li><li>Clarify the responsibility of each involved person and actions to be taken.</li><li>Outline how the process will be monitored and evaluated.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Child Protection Register</strong> — contains confidential details of children who are at continuing risk of abuse or neglect and/or for whom there is a Child Protection Plan.</li><li><strong>Local Safeguarding Children Board (LSCB)</strong> — a local authority body that is is responsible for the coordination and monitoring of effective multi-agency working as required by section 13 of the Children Act 2004.</li><li><strong>Serious Case Review</strong> — undertaken where abuse or neglect of a child is known or suspected, and has either resulted in death or serious harm, and there is also a concern as to the way in which the authority, their Board partners, or other relevant persons have worked together to safeguard the child</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/child-maltreatment-recognition-management/references/\">Coram Children's Legal Centre, 2013</a>;
