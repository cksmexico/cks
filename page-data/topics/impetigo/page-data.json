The two main clinical forms are non-bullous impetigo and bullous impetigo.<ul><li>Non-bullous impetigo is caused by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> or a combination of both and accounts for the majority of cases (about 70%).</li><li>Bullous impetigo is caused by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> — bullae are fluid filled lesions which are usually more than 5mm in diameter.</li><li>Impetigo caused by Meticillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) is becoming increasingly common.</li></ul></li><li>Impetigo affects all age groups but is most common in young children. The annual incidence is around 2.8% in children up to 4 years of age, and 1.6% in children 5–15 years of age.</li><li>Impetigo is usually a mild infection, complications (such as glomerulonephritis and cellulitis) are rare.</li><li>Non-bullous impetigo presents with thin walled vesicles or pustules (seldom seen on clinical examination as they rupture quickly) which release exudate forming a golden/brown crust.<ul><li>Non-bullous impetigo is usually asymptomatic but may be mildly itchy.</li><li>The area around the mouth and nose is most commonly affected, although other areas of the face and the extremities may also be involved.</li></ul></li><li>Bullous impetigo most commonly affects infants, although older children and adults can also be affected.<ul><li>It presents with flaccid fluid filled vesicles and blisters (often with a diameter of 1-2cm) which can persist for 2-3 days. These blisters rupture leaving a thin flat yellow/brown crust.</li><li>Lesions most often occur on the flexures, face, trunk and limbs and can be particularly widespread in infants.</li><li>Systemic features (such as fever and lymphadenopathy) may occur if large areas of skin are affected.</li></ul></li><li>Diagnosis of impetigo is usually clinical but swabs (of exudate from a moist lesion or de-roofed blister) for culture and sensitivities should be considered in cases which are persistent despite treatment, recurrent, or widespread.</li><li>The management of impetigo in primary care includes:<ul><li>Advising the person on hygiene measures to aid healing and stop infection spreading to other areas of the body and to other people.</li><li>Advising children and adults to stay away from school or work until the lesions are dry and scabbed over or, if the lesions are still crusted or weeping, for 48 hours after antibiotic treatment has started.</li><li>Ensuring pre-existing skin conditions (such as eczema) are optimally treated.</li><li>Treating localized non-bullous infection with topical hydrogen peroxide for five days, or a topical antibiotic if this is not suitable. More extensive, severe or bullous infection may require oral antibiotics (flucloxacillin or clarithromycin if allergic to penicillin) for five days (or seven days depending on clinical judgment).</li></ul></li><li>Follow up is not usually necessary but the person should be advised to return if symptoms worsen rapidly or significantly at any time, or have not improved after completing a course of treatment.</li></ul><!-- end field f30802a7-a26b-48d3-afb8-ebf5a5c776f2 --><!-- end item f183b935-73d0-4c23-b39a-ab6985fa09ef -->","topic":{"id":"df142ae3-a675-5faa-955f-deba3aa176bc","topicId":"08c2a82c-2e88-477a-a00d-e75b47770e61","topicName":"Impetigo","slug":"impetigo","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"5d5b7bff-ba78-5008-89df-49963bc208b7","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"35862574-df78-5554-bbe6-86275287ef3a","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"bc13ef99-c08d-5361-89de-765433a18ce3","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"8abd7c1c-e4d5-5fc6-9deb-2cfbbee04b6a","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"5105f48d-40d4-5c74-bec6-af0574471e5a","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"8c2bfe64-9ced-531b-b641-00b4ff18bd7c","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"eaefc2a4-19e1-525e-82f4-dccc7115b2b6","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"5a84c42b-0cca-52ed-9924-c54417494c01","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"5275b616-56f0-5b49-b2df-0cbffee7e3fc","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"6ed2c217-68c2-5ecc-8c61-7187fcbead1b","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"1dec750c-6e33-5adf-ae33-87a7f4a042c2","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
