Although placebo-controlled trials have shown that untreated impetigo usually resolves in about 2–3 weeks [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">Koning et al, 2012</a>], topical treatment is effective and has few adverse effects. In addition, untreated impetigo is highly contagious and there is a risk it may become generalized.<ul><li><em>Public Health England Guidance for schools, nurseries and other childcare facilities </em>states that antibiotic treatment of impetigo speeds healing and reduces the infectious period [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">PHE, 2018</a>].</li><li>A Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis of treatments for impetigo found that topical antibiotic treatment showed better cure rates than placebo (relative risk= 2.24; 95% CI 1.61 to 3.13) in six studies (n=575) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">Koning et al, 2012</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Choice of antibiotic</h5><ul><li>Several clinical guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">Stevens, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">PHE, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">PCDS, 2018</a>], a Canadian clinical effectiveness review <em>Topical antibiotics for impetigo: a review of the clinical effectiveness and guidelines</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">CADTH, 2017</a>], a dermatology textbook [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">Hay, 2016</a>] and review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">Hartman-Adams, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">Lawton, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">Ramakrishnan, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">Kosar, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2018</a>] recommend treatment with topical antibiotics for mild localized impetigo and oral antibiotics for people with widespread, severe or bullous impetigo.</li><li><strong>Topical antibiotics</strong><ul><li>Local patterns of resistance should be considered when prescribing antibiotics [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">Hartman-Adams, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">Hay, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">CADTH, 2017</a>].</li><li>Expert consensus from Public Health England Expert Panel and the British Infection Association Expert Panel on use of topical antibiotics in impetigo is that they should be used only for treatment of very localised lesions as widespread use of topical fusidic acid may lead to increased resistance rendering it ineffective for more serious staphylococcal infections. If a topical antibiotic is prescribed, a five day course is recommended to reduce the risk of bacterial resistance [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">PHE, 2017</a>].</li><li>Fusidic acid is effective against <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> and has been found to be as effective as mupirocin in a Cochrane systematic review and meta-analysis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">Koning et al, 2012</a>].<ul><li>Four studies (n=440) comparing mupirocin ointment 2%, three times daily for five to 10 days, and fusidic acid cream gel 2%, two to three times  daily for a maximum of 21 days found that  none were more effective than the others (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">Koning et al, 2012</a>].</li><li>Public Health England recommend that mupirocin should be reserved for the treatment of impetigo known to be caused by methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) to reduce the risk of resistance developing [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">PHE, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Oral antibiotics</strong><ul><li>Local patterns of resistance should be considered when prescribing antibiotics [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">Hartman-Adams, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">Hay, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">CADTH, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">NICE, 2020</a>]. </li><li>Expert consensus from Public Health England Expert Panel and the British Infection Association Expert Panel is that oral antibiotics should be used for extensive, severe, or bullous impetigo. <ul><li>Flucloxacillin should be used first line (unless impetigo is confirmed due to MRSA) as it is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic effective against most staphylococcal and streptococcal species [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">PHE, 2017</a>].</li><li>Clarithromycin is recommended as the macrolide antibiotic of choice for people who are allergic to penicillin — it is active against most staphylococcal and streptococcal species [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">PHE, 2017</a>]. It is generally considered to cause less adverse effects than erythromycin and have greater compliance as it only requires twice-daily dosing [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">PHE, 2017</a>].</li><li>A Cochrane review looking at treatment of impetigo [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">Koning et al, 2012</a>] found no significant differences in cure rates from treatment with topical versus other oral antibiotics (based on 22 RCTs, n=884) however as there was a lack of studies in people with extensive impetigo it was not clear if oral antibiotics are superior to topical antibiotics in this group.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h5>Follow up</h5><ul><li><strong>Treatment failure</strong><ul><li>Most controlled trials have shown positive results from topical and oral antibiotics after 1 week [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">Koning et al, 2012</a>].</li><li>Switching from flucloxacillin to a different oral antibiotic (for example, clarithromycin) is not recommended — in this situation, there is the possibility that the infection is caused by MRSA and it is reasonable to extend initial treatment, while waiting for bacterial sensitivity data.</li><li>In all cases of treatment failure, MRSA should be considered — swabs are necessary to confirm or exclude this [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">Stevens, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">PHE, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">PCDS, 2018</a>].</li></ul></li><li><strong>Nasal staphylococcal carriage</strong><ul><li>The recommendation for the detection and subsequent management of nasal staphylococcal carriage is based on expert opinion from CKS reviewers and expert opinion in clinical guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">PCDS, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/impetigo/references/\">NICE, 2020</a>]. </li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field ac77f9cd-1565-423d-8c8e-f684bce72187 --><!-- end item 9db1a83b-c9c4-4583-8459-d8e407b0c1e2 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
