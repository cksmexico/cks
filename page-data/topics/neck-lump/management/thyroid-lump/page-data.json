<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Walker, 2019</a>].</li></ul><h5>Arranging urgent specialist referral</h5><ul><li>The recommendation regarding an unexplained thyroid lump is based on the NICE clinical guideline, which aims to exclude a diagnosis of thyroid cancer using this approach [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">NICE, 2017b</a>].</li><li>The recommendation regarding thyroid mass with associated unexplained hoarseness or voice change is based on the BTA publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">BTA, 2014</a>]. In addition, expert opinion in review articles notes that associated symptoms such as voice changes may suggest underlying malignancy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Bailey, 2018</a>], and recent onset of hoarseness may be due to tumour invasion of the recurrent laryngeal nerve [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Burman, 2015</a>].</li><li>The recommendation regarding thyroid mass associated cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is based on the BTA publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">BTA, 2014</a>]. In addition, expert opinion in a review article notes that the presence of cervical lymph nodes ipsilateral to the thyroid nodule may indicate thyroid malignancy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Burman, 2015</a>].</li><li>The recommendation regarding a sudden-onset rapidly expanding thyroid mass is based on the BTA publication, as this may be a rare presentation of anaplastic thyroid cancer or thyroid lymphoma [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">BTA, 2014</a>]. This is supported by expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Burman, 2015</a>].</li><li>The recommendation regarding a thyroid nodule with other red flags or risk factors for malignancy is based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Walker, 2019</a>].</li><li>The recommendation regarding a thyroid nodule with associated compressive symptoms is extrapolated from expert opinion from review articles, which note that associated symptoms such as dysphagia may suggest underlying malignancy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Bailey, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Walker, 2019</a>]. It is also pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li><li>The recommendation to refer all children urgently is based on the BTA publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">BTA, 2014</a>]. In addition, the ATA Guidelines Task Force publication notes that thyroid nodules are more likely to be malignant in children than in adults, and some forms of thyroid cancer in children may present with diffuse enlargement of a thyroid lobe or the entire thyroid gland, prompting the need for further imaging [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Francis, 2015</a>].</li></ul><h5>Arranging serum thyroid function tests (TFTs) in primary care</h5><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the BTA publication, which notes that TFT results may be useful to help guide the appropriate referral pathway [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">BTA, 2014</a>]. This is supported by expert opinion in a review article, which notes that baseline TFTs are particularly useful if there is suspected hypo- or hyperthyroidism [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Walker, 2019</a>].</li><li>The AAO-HNSF clinical practice guideline notes that an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level may be associated with toxic multinodular goitre, and a decreased TSH level may be associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves' disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Pynnonen, 2017</a>].</li><li>The ATA Guidelines Task Force publication strongly recommends that TFTs should be measured during the initial assessment of a person with a suspected thyroid nodule on examination or when picked up incidentally on imaging, based on moderate-quality evidence [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Haugen, 2016</a>]. This approach is also supported by expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Burman, 2015</a>].</li></ul><h5>Arranging routine specialist referral</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to refer if there is a non-suspicious thyroid nodule and abnormal TFTs is based on the BTA publication, which notes there is a low risk of malignancy in this population [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">BTA, 2014</a>]. The ATA Guidelines Task Force publication strongly recommends that if the TSH is below the normal range, further assessment such as radionuclide scan is needed to assess whether there is an overactive thyroid gland or hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule, based on moderate-quality evidence [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Haugen, 2016</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to refer if there is a non-suspicious thyroid nodule and normal TFTs is extrapolated from the BTA publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">BTA, 2014</a>]. This approach is supported by expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Walker, 2019</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to refer if there is suspected haemorrhage into a benign thyroid cyst is based on the BTA publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">BTA, 2014</a>] and expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Burman, 2015</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to refer if there is an incidental thyroid nodule that is more than 1 cm in diameter is extrapolated from expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Walker, 2019</a>].</li></ul><h5>Arranging monitoring in primary care</h5><ul><li>The recommendation regarding monitoring a longstanding non-suspicious thyroid nodule or mass in primary care is based on the BTA publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">BTA, 2014</a>].</li><li>The recommendation regarding monitoring a small, asymptomatic incidental thyroid nodule in primary care is based on the BTA publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">BTA, 2014</a>]. In addition, expert opinion in a review article notes that such nodules have a very low likelihood of malignancy, and if cancer is detected, it is likely to be indolent with a good prognosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Walker, 2019</a>].</li></ul><h5>Not routinely arranging further investigations in primary care</h5><ul><li>The recommendation not to routinely arrange neck or thyroid ultrasound in primary care is based on the BTA publication, which states that this may delay a diagnosis of thyroid cancer. The guideline does note, however, that ultrasound is an extremely sensitive examination for thyroid nodules, can be specific for the diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma, and aids decision-making about on which nodules to perform fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">BTA, 2014</a>].<ul><li>CKS notes that various other guidelines and review articles in the literature highlight the benefits of arranging a neck ultrasound if a thyroid nodule is suspected, including providing information on nodule size, clinical features for risk stratification of malignancy, and guiding the need for additional investigations [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Burman, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Haugen, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Pynnonen, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Bailey, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neck-lump/references/\">Tan, 2020</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 072a06c9-ce89-4ee7-8416-a97ed3134414 --><!-- end item cf58fe53-0854-466b-a1fb-1791335a2b12 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
