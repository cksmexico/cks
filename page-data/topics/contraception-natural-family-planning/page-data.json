Cervical secretions are experienced during the fertile time.</li><li>Changes in the cervix — the woman can palpate the cervix. The fertile window starts at the first sign of the cervix changing from being low and firm, and the cervical os closed, to the cervix being high and soft. It ends when the cervix becomes low and firm and the cervical os has been closed again for 3 days.</li><li>Basal body temperature — can be monitored every day. A slight rise in temperature that persists for 3 days indicates that the fertile time has ended.</li><li>Length of menstrual cycle (calendar day method) — this involves calculating the length of the menstrual cycle and using this to estimate the time of ovulation and the fertile days of the menstrual cycle.</li></ul><li>Fertility awareness methods may also use:</li><ul><li>Computerized fertility monitoring devices which use dipsticks to follow changes of hormone concentrations in the urine.</li><li>Note: Urine dipstick tests for luteinizing hormone and ovulation predictor kits are intended to help women conceive. However, they are not effective as a natural family planning method.</li></ul><li>The fertile time is more accurately estimated by a combination of methods than by any single method.</li><li>Several medical conditions can make the use of fertility awareness methods more complex, such as those causing irregular vaginal bleeding. </li><li>The lactational amenorrhoea method prevents pregnancy by breastfeeding delaying the return of ovulation after childbirth. The following conditions must all be met:</li><ul><li>Complete amenorrhoea.</li><li>Fully or very nearly fully breastfeeding.</li><li>6 months or less since the baby was born.</li></ul><li>There are no medical conditions in which the use of lactational amenorrhoea is restricted, and there is no evidence of its negative impact on maternal health. However, where pregnancy is an unacceptable risk, or where breastfeeding is contraindicated, other methods should be considered in preference.</li></ul><!-- end field c280d31a-7b8d-436d-94a2-40abec73a168 --><!-- end item 203f408b-9562-43cc-aa7f-530c6bc1b949 -->","topic":{"id":"1d6ccc49-9014-518f-a4b0-594944b43b96","topicId":"35dc00f6-73c3-4a41-8f98-7ee7dc4f081a","topicName":"Contraception -
