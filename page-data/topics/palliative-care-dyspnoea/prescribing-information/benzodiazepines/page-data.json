In general, therapy in elderly and debilitated people should be started at low doses.</li><li>Lorazepam is useful in the acute scenario because it is a short-acting benzodiazepine (half-life of 12–15 hours) and has a fast onset of action. Lorazepam works within 10 minutes when administered sublingually (although this route is outside the product licence).</li><li>Diazepam may be more appropriate for more chronic anxiety-related dyspnoea symptoms because it is a medium- to long-acting benzodiazepine with a half-life of 20–100 hours.</li><li>Midazolam can be used for intractable breathlessness, when required or by continuous subcutaneous infusion to relieve symptoms. It has a half-life of 2–5 hours, although the half-life is prolonged up to 3 times in people older than 60 years of age. Its main advantage is that it is compatible with most of the drugs commonly given by continuous subcutaneous infusion.</li></ul><p>These recommendations are based on palliative care guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-dyspnoea/references/\">International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-dyspnoea/references/\">NHMRC, 2004</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-dyspnoea/references/\">NHS Scotland, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-dyspnoea/references/\">NCCN, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-dyspnoea/references/\">NHS Lothian, 2010</a>] and expert opinion from the palliative care literature [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-dyspnoea/references/\">Regnard, 2010</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-dyspnoea/references/\">Thomas et al, 2011</a>].</p><!-- end field 75aec139-b893-4732-8033-461bc624d50b --><!-- end item ec0dc706-7675-4812-bdee-74792b05a4b3 -->","subChapters":[]},{"id":"13ad7427-1215-5bb7-b7d7-a68974d83504","slug":"adverse-effects","fullItemName":"Adverse effects","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field fc77ac4d-67f6-400a-9227-8a3709f44adc --><h3>Adverse effects</h3><!-- end field fc77ac4d-67f6-400a-9227-8a3709f44adc -->","summary":"","htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 45c2ee69-cc16-447d-9e9c-f49cb623b042 --><!-- begin field 62891b5a-6c0c-4d00-84e0-34f1b017b943 --><ul><li>The most frequent adverse effects are drowsiness, sedation, confusion, muscle weakness, and ataxia.</li><li>Less frequent adverse effects include vertigo, headache, respiratory depression, amnesia, and paradoxical excitation.</li><li>If benzodiazepines are prescribed the person should be given the following advice regarding driving [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-dyspnoea/references/\">Department for Transport, 2014</a>]:<ul><li>You should not drive if you feel drowsy, dizzy, unable to concentrate or make decisions, or if you have blurred or double vision.<ul><li>It is now an offence to drive if you have more than a specified amount of benzodiazepines in your body whether your driving is impaired or not.</li><li>Roadside drug screening tests have been introduced into the UK since March 2015.
