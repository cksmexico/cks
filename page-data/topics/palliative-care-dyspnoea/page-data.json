There are multiple possible causes of dyspnoea in people with cancer, including:<ul><li>Direct causes — such as primary lung cancer or lung metastases.</li><li>Indirect effects of cancer — such as pleural effusion, superior vena cava syndrome, anaemia, pulmonary embolism, and surgery.</li><li>Non-malignant causes — such as pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, and anxiety.</li></ul></li><li>Assessment of someone with dyspnoea in a palliative care setting involves asking about:<ul><li>Features of the dyspnoea (for example severity, timing, onset, and precipitating and exacerbating factors).</li><li>Associated physical symptoms (for example cough, sputum, haemoptysis, wheeze, stridor, pleuritic pain, fatigue, and panic).</li><li>Effect on the person’s quality of life.</li></ul></li><li>An appropriate examination for the stage of the person's illness should be carried out, to determine the cause of the dyspnoea.</li><li>The appropriateness of investigation should be considered including the likely benefit of treatment and the person's wishes. Investigations to consider include:<ul><li>Full blood count — to exclude anaemia.</li><li>Pulse oximetry — to assess for hypoxia.</li><li>Chest X-ray — to assess lung disease and heart failure.</li><li>Spirometry — to assess possible undiagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</li><li>Electrocardiography (ECG) — to exclude arrhythmias.</li></ul></li><li>Managing dyspnoea in palliative care involves adopting a stepwise approach, depending on the underlying cause of the dyspnoea and the stage of illness. The following approach should be considered:<ul><li>Simple measures, such as keeping the room cool, the use of a fan, opening a window, relaxation and breathing techniques.</li><li>Encouraging exercise within the person's capabilities.</li><li>Adaptations in activities of daily living and lifestyle expectations.</li><li>Strategies to manage other physical symptoms, and the psychological, social, and spiritual needs of the person and their family.</li><li>A strong opioid, such as immediate-release oral morphine.</li><li>A benzodiazepine short-term, especially if dyspnoea is associated with acute anxiety, or the person is nearing the end of life.</li><li>A bronchodilator if wheeze is thought to be caused by partial airway obstruction from a tumour.</li><li>Oxygen therapy ideally following specialist assessment, especially if the person is at risk of symptomatic hypoxia.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 11e8813e-ad6e-45c0-b619-58605d15a517 --><!-- end item 78ce1128-6a37-43dd-986c-10842df9b739 -->","topic":{"id":"20d4363b-caf3-55a9-beed-09266efa45f4","topicId":"73af552e-909d-456c-86d1-11f7a65040d8","topicName":"Palliative care -
