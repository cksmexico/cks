Presentations in children include:<ul><li>Back pain — in school-age children and adolescents, most back pain will be non-specific and self-limiting.</li><li>Bow legs — a large number of children are born with, or develop, bow legs (genu varum). </li><li>A clumsy child — describes motor coordination difficulties with both fine and gross motor skills. These children struggle to learn motor skills such as writing, dressing, and self-feeding.</li><li>Curly toes — underlapping toe ('curly' toe) deformity is thought to be congenital. It is often noticed early in infancy and most commonly affects the fifth and fourth toes.</li><li>Flat foot — flat foot (pes planus) is common in infants and children and has often resolved by adolescence. It is usually physiologic and of no functional consequence.</li><li>Heel pain — heel pain is commonly reported in young children and adolescents and most causes are benign. </li><li>Hypermobility — hypermobile joints are common. Many children do not have symptoms or associated problems. </li><li>In-toeing — describes medial or internal rotation of the foot relative to the direction the child is moving in; most in-toeing will rectify itself over time<strong>.</strong></li><li>Knock knees — knock knees (genu valgum) is usually a self-limited condition and commonly occurs between 3 and 6 years of age. </li><li>Late walking — at 12 months of age some children will walk alone; by 18 months, they should walk well. Causes of late walking include neuromuscular diseases, neurological disorders, hypermobility, and developmental hip dysplasia.</li><li>Growing pains — one of the most common causes of recurrent musculoskeletal pain in children. Typical findings include bilateral pain in the lower extremities occurring late in the day or during the night.</li><li>Out-toeing — describes lateral or external rotation of the foot relative to the direction in which the child is moving. It is normal in early infancy, usually resolving by 18–24 months of age.</li><li>Tip-toe walking — when a child walks predominantly on their toes or forefoot, with absent heel strike. It is common in children up to 3 years of age.</li></ul></li><li>Although some presentations may be appropriately managed in the community, it is important to be aware of red flags when assessing a child or young person with a musculoskeletal problem as these may require admission or urgent referral.</li><li>Admission to an emergency department should be arranged for children with:<ul><li>Suspected septic arthritis.</li><li>Suspected osteomyelitis.</li><li>Suspected fracture.</li><li>Suspected slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE).</li></ul></li><li>Specialist advice or urgent referral is required for:<ul><li>Suspected inflammatory arthritis, back pain with red flags — rheumatology.</li><li>A limping child in whom SUFE is not suspected; back pain with red flags; back problems (for example scoliosis, neurological symptoms, systemic illness) — orthopaedics.</li><li>Suspected neurological problem; possible cancer; milestone delay or regression; suspected non-accidental injury; bladder or bowel problems; back pain with red flags — paediatrics.</li></ul></li><li>Other features may also be present for which specialist assessment is necessary, but with less urgency.</li></ul><!-- end field a5b74cdd-0b57-47f7-abdb-aa0600b69633 --><!-- end item 31be68d1-1acf-4d96-8b6d-aa0600b69633
