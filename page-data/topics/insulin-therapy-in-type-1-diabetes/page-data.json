Consequently, insulin therapy is a medical necessity.</li><li>Three types of insulin are available in the UK:<ul><li>Human insulins are produced by recombinant DNA technology and have the same amino acid sequence as endogenous human insulin.</li><li>Human insulin analogues are produced in the same way as human insulins but the insulin is modified to produce a specific desired kinetic characteristic (such as an extended duration of action or faster absorption and action).</li><li>Animal insulins (rarely used) are extracted and purified from animal sources, either cows (bovine insulin) or pigs (porcine insulin).</li></ul></li><li>Insulins are broadly categorized according to their time-action profiles:<ul><li>Rapid- and short-acting insulins have a quick onset of action and a short duration of action. They are used to replicate the insulin normally produced by the body in response to glucose absorbed from a meal or sugary drink.</li><li>Intermediate- and long-acting insulins have a slow onset of action and a long duration of action. They mimic the effect of endogenous basal insulin (insulin that is secreted continuously throughout the day).</li></ul></li><li>There is no one insulin regimen that is suitable for all people with type 1 diabetes; treatment should be individualized for each person. Options include:<ul><li>Multiple daily injection basal-bolus insulin regimens.</li><li>Mixed (biphasic) regimen (the person has one, two, or three insulin injections per day).</li><li>Continuous insulin infusion (insulin pump) therapy.</li></ul></li><li>The main adverse effect of insulin therapy is hypoglycaemia, which is generally defined as blood glucose levels less than 3.5 mmol/L.<ul><li>Symptoms can range from hunger, anxiety, irritability, palpitations, sweating or tingling lips, to convulsions, loss of consciousness, and coma.</li><li>People receiving insulin therapy should be provided with education and information on awareness and management of hypoglycaemia, and should always have available a fast-acting source of glucose to manage hypoglycaemia.</li><li>In cases of severe hypoglycaemia where a person has a reduced level of consciousness, intramuscular glucagon that is given by another person is recommended.</li></ul></li><li>Insulin treatment should only be initiated and managed by healthcare professionals with the relevant expertise and training. Other primary healthcare professionals may have a supporting role in providing general information on issues such as:<ul><li>Insulin administration, including injection technique and site.</li><li>Lifestyle and cultural aspects of insulin therapy, including diet and exercise, alcohol intake, driving, holiday and travel, insurance, fasting, and shift work.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field aaa932f8-47d5-493a-a795-fac7458c90ef --><!-- end item 1dbf6f70-2ca8-48a9-868e-d9fa12cc567e -->","topic":{"id":"418fc016-0e56-5e3b-b2ea-3927d2911520","topicId":"fea45be3-7039-4e82-a497-8f104e2219fa","topicName":"Insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes","slug":"insulin-therapy-in-type-1-diabetes","aliases":["Diabetes type 1 -
