Recommendations on follow up of a young person with migraine are based on <em>Guidelines for all healthcare professionals in the diagnosis and management of migraine, tension-type, cluster and medication-overuse headache</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/migraine/references/\">BASH, 2010</a>].</p><ul><li>The British Association for the Study of Headache (BASH) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/migraine/references/\">BASH, 2010</a>] guidance states that children often respond to conservative management — BASH recommend that those with troublesome migraine non-responsive to trigger avoidance and simple analgesia with or without anti-emetics are referred to a paediatrician with an interest in headache.</li><li>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/migraine/references/\">NICE, 2012 (updated 2015)</a>] guidance states that a nasal triptan can be considered for treatment of acute migraine in young people aged 12–17 years. If a nasal triptan is ineffective or not tolerated an anti-emetic (metoclopramide or prochlorperazine) or combination therapy can be considered.<ul><li>NICE recommendations are based on a network meta-analysis for treatments administered by oral and subcutaneous routes and expert opinion from the Guideline Development Group (GDG). Four separate analyses were based on a total of 19 studies of 10 different interventions (five monotherapy and five different combinations of two agents). Only one study of triptan use included people less than 18 years of age:<ul><li>Monotherapy — moderate to very low quality evidence showed moderate efficacy for monotherapy with an oral triptan, NSAID, aspirin (900 mg) or paracetamol.</li><li>Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs — aspirin is not recommended because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs other than ibuprofen are not licensed for the treatment of migraine in children.</li><li>Triptans — the GDG agreed that triptans were an appropriate option for people aged from 12 to 17 years. Oral triptans are not licenced for people aged under 18.</li><li>Combination therapy — the evidence from the network meta-analysis (based on low and very low quality direct comparison evidence) showed good evidence of efficacy of combination treatment with a triptan and either paracetamol or an NSAID when compared to singly administered treatments. The evidence suggested that a triptan and NSAID was a more effective combination than a triptan and paracetamol. </li><li>Anti-emetics — the recommendation to add an anti-emetic is based on GDG informal consensus, based on very low quality evidence from one study which found that paracetamol given with an anti-emetic was more effective than triptans in improving headache at 2 hours, and indirect moderate to very low quality evidence that non-oral metoclopramide and prochlorperazine provide relief from pain at 2 and 24 hours. These benefits are regardless of whether the person has nausea or vomiting. The evidence for non-oral prochlorperazine included children in the study population. No studies in the review looked at the use of non-oral metoclopramide in people under 18 years of age. The GDG agreed that although the risk of extra-pyramidal side effects of anti-emetic drugs is greatest in people under 20 years of age, the benefits justify their use in migraine with consideration of the side effects in at risk groups.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>A Cochrane review (27 randomized controlled trials, n = 9,158) of acute migraine medications in children and adolescents (aged 8.2–14.7 years) found that for producing pain freedom at two hours [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/migraine/references/\">Richer, 2016</a>]:<ul><li>Paracetamol was not superior to placebo (one small study;
