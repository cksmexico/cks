Any person taking mefloquine presenting with a visual disorder should be referred to a specialist as chemoprophylaxis may need to be stopped.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Contraindications</strong><ul><li>Mefloquine is contraindicated in:<ul><li>People with hypersensitivity to mefloquine, any ingredient of the tablets or related compounds such as quinine or quinidine.</li><li>People with a current or previous history of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, psychosis, schizophrenia, suicide attempts, suicidal thoughts, self-endangering behaviour or any other major psychiatric disorders.</li><li>People with a history of epilepsy or convulsions of any origin.</li><li>Those with a history of Blackwater fever.</li><li>Severe liver impairment.</li><li>Cardiac conduction abnormalities.</li><li>Concomitant use with halofantrine (halofantrine should also not be given within 15 weeks after the last dose of mefloquine).</li><li>Infants under 5 kg weight.</li><li>Pilots — the UK Civil Aviation Authority advises that mefloquine should not be administered to pilots, although there is no evidence that mefloquine impairs function.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Cautions</strong><ul><li>Mefloquine should be used with caution in:<ul><li>Pregnancy (in particular in the first trimester) and breastfeeding — a careful risk-benefit analysis is required (seek specialist advice). The UK Teratology Information Service (UKTIS) found no conclusive evidence of adverse outcomes following mefloquine exposure in pregnancy but as data are limited, increased risk of adverse outcomes could not be excluded [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/malaria-prophylaxis/references/\">UKTIS, 2014c</a>]. Clinical guidelines ([<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/malaria-prophylaxis/references/\">CATMAT, 2014</a>] and [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/malaria-prophylaxis/references/\">Chiodini, 2017</a>]) and the UKTIS [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/malaria-prophylaxis/references/\">UKTIS, 2014c</a>] recommend that due to the potential severity of falciparum malaria in pregnant women, its use is generally justified for areas with high risk of falciparum malaria (such as sub-Saharan Africa).</li><li>People who have suffered traumatic brain injury — the decision to recommend mefloquine chemoprophylaxis should be made on an individual basis after a detailed risk assessment.</li><li>Diving — some diving centres do not permit people taking mefloquine to dive. Mefloquine can lower the seizure threshold and its adverse effects could potentially be confused with decompression or narcosis events. It may be best to avoid for diving holidays.</li><li>Military personnel — the ACMP recognises that malaria risk is different in military and civilian travellers. The Ministry of Defence has guidelines for malaria prevention specific to military personnel and civilian practitioners asked to give malaria prevention advice for military travellers should liaise with the Defence Medical Services.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Interactions</strong><ul><li><strong>Halofantrine</strong> — use of halofantrine with mefloquine chemoprophylaxis or treatment of malaria, or within 15 weeks after the last dose of mefloquine, causes a significant lengthening of the QTc interval. Concomitant use is contraindicated.</li><li><strong>Other drugs that alter cardiac conduction</strong> (such as anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) — may prolong QTc interval.</li><li><strong>Anticonvulsants and drugs lowering the epileptogenic threshold</strong> — mefloquine antagonizes the anticonvulsant effect of antiepileptics (such as valproic acid, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin) and may enhance the effect of other drugs (such as antidepressants such as tricyclic or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); bupropion; antipsychotics; tramadol; chloroquine or some antibiotics) in lowering the seizure threshold.</li><li><strong>Drugs that inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme</strong> such as itraconazole may increase mefloquine levels.</li><li><strong>Drugs that induce metabolism of mefloquine</strong> (for example rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, efavirenz) may be expected to reduce mefloquine levels.</li><li>Ritonavir levels are reduced by mefloquine due to decreased absorption.</li><li>Attenuation of immunisation may occur if mefloquine is taken concurrently with oral live typhoid vaccine — the manufacturer recommends that vaccinations with oral attenuated live bacteria be completed at least 3 days before the first dose of mefloquine.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Adverse effects</strong><ul><li><strong>Common or very common reported adverse effects include:</strong><ul><li>Abdominal pain; diarrhoea; dizziness; headache; nausea; vertigo; neuropsychiatric reactions (such as abnormal dreams, insomnia, anxiety, and depression); pruritus; visual disturbances; vomiting.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Uncommon adverse effects include:</strong><ul><li>Optic neuropathy.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Psychosis, suicidal ideation, and suicide</strong> have also been reported.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/malaria-prophylaxis/references/\">ABPI Medicines Compendium, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/malaria-prophylaxis/references/\">BNF 74, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/malaria-prophylaxis/references/\">ABPI, 2017a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/malaria-prophylaxis/references/\">Chiodini, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/malaria-prophylaxis/references/\">CDC, 2018</a>]</p><!-- end field 99856cd5-00b9-4c4f-9a7c-a88e00d44cbe --><!-- end item 2146e91c-abe7-4339-8567-b79188015c9f -->","topic":{"id":"1dfdf856-ced9-50bb-8739-9ac597e749da","topicId":"fcbcecf9-c37c-4236-a0f0-e6ea3ff72076","topicName":"Malaria prophylaxis","slug":"malaria-prophylaxis","lastRevised":"Last revised in January 2018","chapters":[{"id":"ce4f76aa-9527-5f8c-9846-98b8c95af6e4","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"6fd40a83-7b55-56f4-97de-93dd8ba2ad8f","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"665f9f2c-5318-56d6-ac14-83dd936bdf97","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"62945b37-6310-5a07-b2dc-90e23836e367","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"57a7f2b1-f3c6-5c7c-be23-60a85ca3e97f","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"4cbf6005-cbd7-5792-be78-1e08b1755887","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"24cd959e-2b4a-53d8-9a67-2cb6351480d4","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"8bfd8f1f-5162-55f5-98d0-024aa470eda3","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"6e3197bd-4c7e-50e3-8571-464b20b486e6","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"68b0fb84-1d6e-5755-9c2e-89fd57721afa","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"0e6ae722-735b-5e79-85d2-194cb8187380","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
