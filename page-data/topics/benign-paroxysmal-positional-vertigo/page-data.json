It can affect people of any age, but commonly presents between the fifth and seventh decades. Women are affected more often than men.</li><li>BPPV often has a relapsing and remitting course. Recovery can occur spontaneously without treatment, although recurrence is common.</li><li>To diagnose BPPV:<ul><li>Symptoms of vertigo should be confirmed. Symptoms are brought on by specific movements of the head (for example turning over in bed, looking upwards, or bending over).</li><li>The Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre should be used, if appropriate, to demonstrate characteristic findings of BPPV.</li><li>Other causes of vertigo should be considered including Meniere’s disease, vestibular neuronitis, and anxiety disorder.</li><li>Imaging (for example magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography) is not required to confirm the diagnosis of BPPV unless it is necessary to exclude another condition (for example if the person has atypical nystagmus or additional neurological symptoms).</li></ul></li><li>To manage BPPV:<ul><li>The option of watchful waiting should be discussed to see whether symptoms settle without treatment. An explanation that treatment may help the person's symptoms resolve more quickly should be offered.</li><li>If the person prefers treatment, a particle repositioning manoeuvre, such as the Epley manoeuvre should be offered and Brandt-Daroff exercises considered. Symptomatic drug treatment is not usually helpful for people with BPPV.</li><li>The person should be advised to return for follow up in 4 weeks if symptoms have not resolved in case BPPV has been incorrectly diagnosed.</li></ul></li><li>Admission to hospital should be arranged if there is severe nausea and vomiting and an inability to tolerate oral fluids.</li><li>Referral should be arranged to a medically qualified balance specialist (such as an ear, nose, and throat specialist, audiovestibular specialist physician, or care of the elderly physician with a special interest — depending on local protocol) if any of the following apply:<ul><li>The expertise to provide a canalith repositioning procedure (for example the Epley manoeuvre) is not available in primary care.</li><li>Physical limitations affect the safety or practicality of carrying out canalith repositioning procedures in primary care.</li><li>A canalith repositioning procedure (for example the Epley manoeuvre) has been performed and repeated, and symptoms are still present.</li><li>Symptoms or signs are atypical. </li><li>Symptoms and signs have not resolved in 4 weeks. </li><li>There have been three or more periods during which the person has experienced episodes of vertigo.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field eb600acb-6d17-4100-b5dd-3a7ae5843643 --><!-- end item 2d2edb91-483f-4d80-b1ad-598ab93e8f3a -->","topic":{"id":"eea62555-eafd-5d57-89f9-cf642a03c23e","topicId":"2d4ab605-73d9-4d0d-81b2-63f813bffbf4","topicName":"Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo","slug":"benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo","aliases":["Vertigo -
