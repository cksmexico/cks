Minor complications (neck stiffness, horizontal BPPV, and dizziness) were reported [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo/references/\">Hunt et al, 2012</a>]. </li></ul></li></ul><h5>Semont manoeuvre</h5><ul><li>The instructions on how to perform the Semont manoeuvre are based on an article explaining the procedure [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo/references/\">Semont et al, 1988</a>]<strong> </strong>and expert opinion in a US clinical practice guideline that discussed the Semont manoeuvre (an alternative particle repositioning manoeuvre) as an alternative to the Epley manoeuvre [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo/references/\">Bhattacharyya et al, 2017</a>].<strong> </strong>Some experts suggest it may be more suitable in people who have difficulty extending the neck [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo/references/\">Kim and Zee, 2014</a>].<strong> </strong><ul><li>A Cochrane systematic review (search date January 2014) concluded that outcomes for treatment with the Epley manoeuvre are similar to those with treatment with the Semont manoeuvre. The review identified two studies (n = 117) which, when data were pooled, suggested no difference between the two manoeuvres for resolution of nystagmus 7 days post-treatment (OR 7.8; 95% CI 0.32 to 1.88) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo/references/\">Hilton and Pinder, 2014</a>].

It has also been noted that vestibular rehabilitation such as Brandt Daroff exercises may have a role in people who have persistent symptoms following repositioning manoeuvres; are unable to undergo repositioning manoeuvres because of physical comorbidities such as cervical or thoracic spine disease; or refuse to undergo them [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo/references/\">Bhattacharyya et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo/references/\">Bressi et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo/references/\">van Vugt et al, 2017</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Symptomatic drug treatment</h5><ul><li>A US guideline on the management of BPPV recommends, based on evidence in observational studies, that vestibular suppressant drugs are not a suitable routine treatment for BPPV or a substitute for repositioning manoeuvres.

The Cochrane authors also noted that, specifically for people with BPPV, physical repositioning manoeuvres are more effective at achieving complete symptom resolution in the short term. In the longer term there was evidence to suggest that combining physical repositioning manoeuvres with vestibular rehabilitation improved functional recovery [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo/references/\">McDonnell and Hillier, 2015</a>]. </li><li>A review of the literature reiterated the hierarchy of interventions to treat BPPV, starting with a repositioning manoeuvre [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo/references/\">Bressi et al, 2017</a>]. It has also been noted that vestibular rehabilitation may have a role in people who have persistent disability following repositioning manoeuvres, are unable to undergo repositioning manoeuvres because of physical comorbidities such as cervical or thoracic spine disease, or refuse to undergo them [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo/references/\">Bhattacharyya et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo/references/\">Bressi et al, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo/references/\">van Vugt et al, 2017</a>]. </li></ul></li><li>Apart from therapeutic manoeuvres, other treatments that may occasionally be used as a last resort for people with severe, refractory symptoms of BPPV include surgical procedures such as transection of the posterior ampullary nerve or occlusion of the posterior semicircular canal [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo/references/\">Kim and Zee, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo/references/\">Ludman, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo/references/\">Wipperman, 2014</a>]. </li></ul><!-- end field 749af943-98b4-4c75-8d06-ad43c5d2849c --><!-- end item f15202ea-01fd-4ece-a626-07427e878a34 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
