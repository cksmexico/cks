devices</strong><ul><li>These are plastic devices with a mouthpiece at one end and a hole, for a pMDI to be inserted, at the other end.</li><li>There are a number of different devices available, but they are not interchangeable and must be compatible with the pMDI used. </li><li>Spacers are useful because they: <ul><li>Remove the need for coordination between actuation of the pMDI and inhalation. </li><li>Slow down the particles of the drug and allow more time for evaporation of the propellant so that more of the drug can be inhaled and deposited in the lungs.</li><li>Reduce the amount of drug deposited in the oropharynx (thereby reducing local adverse effects and the amount of systemic absorption). </li></ul></li><li>Spacers are of particular benefit for: <ul><li>Children

corticosteroids.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Dry powder inhalers (DPIs)</strong><ul><li>DPIs do not have a propellant — they deliver the micronized drug and a carrier powder that is inhaled using the person's own inspiratory flow (this requires the person to have sufficient inspiratory effort to breathe in the powder). <ul><li>Many DPIs incorporate dose counters to show the number of doses used, or the number of doses remaining.</li></ul></li><li>DPIs do not require the person to breathe in and press the inhaler at the same time, so are suitable when coordination and dexterity is a problem. </li><li>DPIs are generally more expensive than pMDIs (plus spacer), but are no more effective. </li><li>DPIs are usually larger than pMDIs, but can usually still fit in a pocket. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Breath-actuated MDIs (BA-MDIs)</strong><ul><li>These are automatically activated on inhalation (the person needs to have sufficient inspiratory effort to activate the device). </li><li>BA-MDIs are as effective as pMDIs and are useful when coordination and dexterity is a problem as there is no need to breathe in and press the inhaler at the same time. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Nebulizers</strong><ul><li>Solutions are administered over 5–10 minutes from a nebulizer, usually driven by oxygen, which converts the solution into an aerosol that can be inhaled through a mask or mouthpiece. <ul><li>A mouthpiece is preferable to avoid adverse effects caused by exposure of the skin and eyes to the corticosteroid. </li></ul></li><li>Their main advantage is that no coordination is required by the user, and high doses of drug can be delivered directly to the airways. </li><li>Nebulized corticosteroids are reserved for when inhaled treatment
