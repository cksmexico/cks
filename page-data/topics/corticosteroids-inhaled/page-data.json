Inhaled corticosteroids:<ul><li>Decrease the formation of cytokines (an inflammatory mediator). </li><li>Decrease microvascular permeability.</li><li>Inhibit influx of eosinophils into the lung, reducing overall inflammation. </li><li>Reduce bronchial hyper-responsiveness. </li></ul></li><li>Inhaled corticosteroids are delivered directly into the lungs (via a number of devices), which reduces systemic absorption and the risk of adverse effects compared with oral corticosteroids.</li><li>Inhaled corticosteroids available in the UK include:<ul><li>Beclometasone dipropionate (aerosol inhaler and dry powder inhaler).</li><li>Budesonide (dry powder inhaler and single-dose units for nebulization).</li><li>Ciclesonide (aerosol inhaler).</li><li>Fluticasone propionate (dry powder inhaler, aerosol inhaler, and single-dose units for nebulization).</li><li>Mometasone furoate (dry powder inhaler).</li></ul></li><li>Inhaled corticosteroids are also available as compound preparations containing long-acting beta-2 agonists.</li><li>The various inhaled corticosteroids are similar in efficacy and adverse effect profile — however, Qvar and Kelhale products have extrafine particles and are twice as potent as other beclometasone inhalers.</li><li>Prescribing inhalers generically should be avoided — this ensures continuity of device type in future and helps prevent adherence issues that may occur if a different device is given. </li><li>There are no contraindications to the use of inhaled corticosteroids. However, care should be taken in people with active (untreated) or quiescent tuberculosis, or untreated fungal, bacterial, parasitic, or systemic viral infections, or ocular herpes simplex.</li><li>Inhaled corticosteroids can be used at any stage of pregnancy and in mothers who are breastfeeding.</li><li>Local adverse effects include:<ul><li>Oral candidiasis, sore mouth, dysphonia, and hoarseness, especially in high doses.</li><li>Paradoxical bronchospasm.</li></ul></li><li>Systemic adverse effects are rare but may occur if high doses are prescribed for prolonged periods. Possible systemic adverse effects include:<ul><li>Adrenal suppression, reduced bone mineral density, bruising, cataract, and glaucoma.</li><li>Growth suppression — may occur in children on high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, but final adult height does not seem to be affected.</li><li>Adrenal crisis, coma, and death — very rarely in children.</li><li>Psychological and behavioural changes.</li><li>Increased susceptibility to infection. </li><li>Reduced bone mineral density.</li></ul></li><li>The adverse effects of inhaled corticosteroids can be minimized by:<ul><li>Titrating to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is achieved.</li><li>Avoiding a rapid reduction in corticosteroid dose after prolonged use.</li><li>Considering prescribing a large-volume spacer with a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) if high doses of inhaled corticosteroids are needed.</li><li>Advising the person to rinse their mouth with water after using the inhaler.</li></ul></li><li>The person should carry a steroid treatment card if they are receiving long-term treatment with high doses of inhaled corticosteroids.</li><li>In children taking inhaled corticosteroids, height should be monitored regularly.</li></ul><!-- end field da286900-ddc5-4fd8-bad7-348ce7d21c38 --><!-- end item 44f61cd7-169d-46fe-b86b-5e01282a0366 -->","topic":{"id":"754932e3-62ea-5d15-b61d-d5a5d6f4fe71","topicId":"702fbe32-706c-43c3-bc60-c5cc8f25f0a7","topicName":"Corticosteroids -
