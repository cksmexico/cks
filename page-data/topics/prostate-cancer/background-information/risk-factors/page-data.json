Prostate cancer mainly affects men aged over 50 years. <ul><li>Autopsy studies show that by the age of 80 years, 80% of men will have evidence of prostate cancer. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Black ethnicity </strong>—<strong> </strong>men of black ethnicity are at highest risk of developing prostate cancer.<ul><li>The lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer is 1 in 4 for black men, compared to 1 in 8 for white men.</li><li>Black men are also twice as likely to die of the disease. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Family history of prostate cancer and genetics </strong>—<strong> </strong>men with a family history of prostate cancer are at increased risk.<ul><li>The lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer is 8%, but increases depending on the number of relatives affected and the age at which they were diagnosed. See Table 1 for details.</li><li>About 9% of men have true hereditary prostate cancer — three or more affected relatives or at least two relatives who have developed early-onset prostate cancer (aged less than 55 years).<ul><li>Apart from the onset being 6–7 years earlier than the average, the clinical course is no different from other prostate cancers.</li></ul></li><li>Mutations in genes such as HOXB13 and BRCA1/2 have been associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Weight </strong>— obesity and being overweight are associated with advanced prostate cancer. Lower testosterone levels increase the risk of more aggressive tumours.<ul><li>Men have a 15–20% increased risk of dying from prostate cancer with every 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Table 1</strong>.
