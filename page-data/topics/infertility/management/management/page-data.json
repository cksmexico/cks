(NICE) guideline <em>Fertility: assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>].</p><h5>Involving both partners in the consultation</h5><ul><li>Two surveys identified by NICE reported that women are more satisfied if seen with their partners at their infertility consultation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h5>Information on the normal pattern of conception</h5><ul><li>This information is based on the NICE guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>] and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) <em>Fertility treatment 2014: Trends and figures </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">HFEA, 2016</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in a Committee Statement developed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) is that education and enhanced awareness of the effect of age on fertility are essential in counselling couples who are concerned about infertility [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">ACOG/ASRM, 2014</a>].</li></ul><h5>Advising regular sexual intercourse and not recommending the use of temperature charts or luteinizing hormone (LH) detection methods</h5><ul><li>Evidence from well-designed non-experimental descriptive studies identified by NICE suggests that sexual intercourse every 2–3 days is likely to maximize the overall chance of natural conception, as spermatozoa survive in the female reproductive tract for up to 7 days after insemination [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>].</li><li>Evidence from six cohort studies that evaluated the use of basal body temperature or urinary LH kits to time intercourse showed that use of these kits causes stress. Moreover, they have not been shown to improve conception rates. The use of these kits is therefore not routinely recommended. However, NICE states that use of LH kits to predict ovulation can be useful for a minority of couples who find it difficult to have frequent sexual intercourse [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h5>Smoking</h5><ul><li>NICE advises that smoking is likely to impair fertility [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>].<ul><li>Evidence from a systematic review and a meta-analysis of observational studies shows that smoking and reduced fertility in women are significantly associated [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">Hughes and Brennan, 1996</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">Augood et al, 1998</a>].</li><li>Evidence from a longitudinal study shows that passive smoking is detrimental to fertility in women [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">Hull et al, 2000</a>]. In men, there is no clear evidence that smoking delays conception or affects fertility, but it may affect sperm quality and general health [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Weight</h5><ul><li>Obesity can impair fertility in both women and men. It can also lead to complications during pregnancy as well as adverse effects on the offspring [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">ASRM, 2015</a>].</li><li>Evidence identified by NICE shows that women with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>take longer to conceive than women with a lower BMI, even after adjustment for other factors, such as menstrual irregularity [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>].<ul><li>For infertile anovulatory women with a BMI greater than 29 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, there is evidence that a supervised weight loss programme or a group programme including exercise, dietary advice, and support helps to reduce weight, resume ovulation, and improve pregnancy rates [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">Clark et al, 1998</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>].</li></ul></li><li>There is no proven association between male obesity and infertility, although observational studies have found that obesity is associated with poorer general health, a reduction in sperm motility, and increased sperm DNA fragmentation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">Kort et al, 2003a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">Kort et al, 2003b</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>].<ul><li>An observational study reported an inverse relationship between BMI and the total number of normal motile sperm. Men who were overweight (BMI 25–30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) had a significantly reduced number of motile sperm compared with men with normal body weight (BMI 20–24 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">Kort et al, 2003b</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Occupational risks</h5><ul><li>Some occupations involve exposure to hazards that can reduce male or female infertility. Evidence suggestive of a harmful effect on the human reproductive system has been recognised for specific agents, such as heat, metals, pesticides, and X-rays, but information on the association of most chemical and physical agents with infertility is lacking, mainly because these agents were rapidly introduced into industry [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>].</li><li>More than 104,000 chemical and physical agents have been identified in the workplace, but at least 95% of these have not been assessed for their effect on reproduction [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>].</li></ul><h5>Alcohol</h5><ul><li>The recommendation on alcohol use by women is based on advice from the Department of Health (DOH), who now recommend no alcohol consumption when trying to conceive [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">DH, 2012</a>].</li><li>NICE states that [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/infertility/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health, 2013</a>]:<ul><li>The evidence for a link between alcohol and female infertility is inconsistent, but excessive alcohol consumption is harmful to the fetus.</li><li>Excessive alcohol consumption can be detrimental to semen quality, but the effect is reversible and there is no evidence for a causal relationship between moderate alcohol consumption and poor semen quality.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Other risk factors</h5><ul><li><strong>Caffeine</strong> — the association between caffeine and female infertility is inconsistent. NICE found no studies on the effect of caffeine on pregnancy rates or the effect of decaffeinated beverages on fertility. One observational study of caffeine intake and male fertility found no evidence of an association between caffeine intake and poor semen variables.

Low doses of ovary-stimulating hormones (oral anti-oestrogens or gonadotrophins) might be given (stimulated IUI) to maximize pregnancy rates.</li><li>In vitro fertilization (IVF) — involves retrieval of one or more eggs, which are mixed with sperm and incubated for 2–3 days; the resultant embryo is then injected into the uterus via the cervix. This method is suitable for women who have blocked fallopian tubes, men with a minor degree of subfertility, and couples who have been diagnosed with unexplained infertility or have been unsuccessful with other techniques (such as ovulation induction or intrauterine insemination).</li><li>Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) — involves injecting an individual sperm directly into the egg to bypass natural barriers that prevent fertilization. The embryo is then transferred into the uterus. This method is suitable when the man has a very low sperm count or problems maintaining an erection and ejaculation (such as diabetes or spinal cord injury).</li><li>Donor insemination — involves insemination of sperm, from a donor, into a woman via her vagina into the cervical canal or into the uterus itself (IUI). This method is considered when the man has no (or very few) sperm on testicular biopsy or surgical extraction, has had a vasectomy and reversal has failed or not been tried, or has an infectious disease (such as HIV), or where there is a high risk of transmitting a genetic disorder to the offspring. It is also considered in couples where there is no male partner.</li><li>Oocyte donation — involves stimulation of the donor's ovaries and collection of eggs. The donated eggs are then fertilized by the recipient's partner's sperm. After 2–3 days, the embryos are transferred to the uterus of the recipient via the cervix, after hormonal preparation of the endometrium. This method is considered for women who have ovarian failure (premature or after radiotherapy or chemotherapy); those who have had bilateral oophorectomy; those with gonadal dysgenesis, including Turner's syndrome; and when the risk of transmitting a genetic disorder is high. It is also used in certain cases of IVF failure.</li><li>Embryo donation — couples who have had successful IVF or ICSI may decide to donate their spare embryos to help other infertile couples.</li><li>Gamete intrafallopian transfer — this involves retrieving eggs, mixing them with prepared sperm, and injecting the eggs (maximum of three) with the sperm into the fallopian tube.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Further information on many aspects of infertility treatments can be found on the website of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA, <a
