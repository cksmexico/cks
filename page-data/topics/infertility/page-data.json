This rises cumulatively to 92% after 2 years and 93% after 3 years.</li></ul></li><li>It is estimated that one in seven UK couples has difficulty conceiving (approximately 3.5 million people).</li><li>In the UK:<ul><li>The main causes of infertility are ovulatory disorders (25% of couples), tubal damage (20% of couples), male infertility (30% of couples), and uterine or peritoneal disorders (10% of couples). </li><li>There is no identifiable cause of infertility in about 25% of couples.</li><li>The presence of disorders in both the man and the woman has been reported in about 40% of infertile couples.</li></ul></li><li>Risk factors for infertility include smoking, obesity, occupational risks, excessive alcohol consumption, and drug use. Female fertility declines with age; the effect of age on male fertility is less clear.</li><li>Psychological stress (for both the woman and the man) may be caused by infertility as well as the investigations and treatment. </li><li>All couples who are concerned about their fertility should be offered an initial assessment (history and examination) in primary care to identify those who need early investigation or referral and those who have modifiable risk factors (such as obesity and smoking).</li><li>Investigations for infertility are not usually recommended until the couple has been unable to conceive after 1 year of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. However, investigations should be offered earlier than 1 year to couples who have been identified as less likely to conceive (for example if the woman is<strong> </strong>aged 36 years and older).<ul><li>Initial investigations in women include mid-luteal phase progesterone (in all women to confirm ovulation), serum gonadotrophins (in women with irregular menstrual cycles), thyroid function tests (in women with symptoms of thyroid disease), prolactin measurement (in women with an ovulatory disorder, galactorrhoea, or a suspected pituitary tumour), and screening for chlamydia.</li><li>Initial investigations in men include semen analysis and screening for chlamydia.</li></ul></li><li>Referral criteria may vary among health authorities.<ul><li>For women younger than 36 years with normal history, examination, and investigations in both partners, referral should usually be considered if the couple have not conceived after 1 year.</li><li>Earlier referral may be considered in women older than 35 years, or if the history, examination, and investigations of either partner suggest an underlying cause.</li></ul></li><li>There are three main types of fertility treatment: <ul><li>Medical treatment includes the use of drugs (such as clomifene) to induce ovulation. </li><li>Surgical treatment includes tubal microsurgery in women with mild tubal disease and surgical correction of epididymal blockage in men with obstructive azoospermia. </li><li>Assisted conception includes intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization, and intracytoplasmic sperm injection.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 46d25593-5e1b-4f55-9c90-3177e97d86e7 --><!-- end item 833c5435-0f4a-4ce3-a2fe-f37f5a5b5264 -->","topic":{"id":"b483324a-37b9-5f49-b7be-a7f6cfd6b762","topicId":"ab48b4fc-b555-4e54-b988-210147856316","topicName":"Infertility","slug":"infertility","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"bc1c5274-569f-55f5-bcc0-ca258c255e18","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"596e6d6e-303a-5fbb-8ad2-d09a7ae718b6","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"945608ab-0334-504a-a20c-57329e1cf294","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"b3b983e6-4a18-5365-a9db-262de3b75560","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"c5c71769-2cdc-5f9a-9cf7-1f39e2f129af","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"771e675f-4650-5f6d-afce-c14eff657312","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"c72015a2-123c-5173-89ff-4e85518a9edb","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"a60603b0-13b2-5456-a376-255e241d168d","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"fee4f6f6-8419-5911-b8b4-b43ec948c31c","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"3f63d512-5bd0-56e5-ac64-e93123143a73","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"8e81a1d7-39ec-5303-b4f8-9f1bbf9e00a3","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
