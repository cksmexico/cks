It may change over time, for example, with changing levels of consciousness, emotional distress, or due to the effects of alcohol and/or drugs. Capacity may also vary according to the decision that needs to be made. The Mental Capacity Act (2005) states that all people aged 16 years and over are presumed to have capacity. It aims to balance a person's right to make decisions for themselves with their right to be protected from harm.</li><li><strong>The Mental Capacity Act (2005) has five key principles:</strong><ul><li>Presumption of capacity — adults should always be presumed to have the capacity to make a decision, unless the healthcare professional can prove otherwise.</li><li>Maximizing decision-making capacity — the person must be given all practical support before it can be decided that they lack capacity. Support may involve extra time for assessment, repeating the assessment if capacity fluctuates, or using an interpreter, sign language, or pictures.</li><li>The freedom to make seemingly unwise decisions — if the person makes a seemingly unwise decision, this in itself is not proof of incapacity. Proof of incapacity depends on the process by which the decision is made, not the decision itself.</li><li>Best interests — any decision or action taken on behalf of the person must be in their best interests. If the decision can be delayed until the person regains capacity, then it should be. A decision taken on another's behalf should take account of their wishes, including those expressed in an advance decision, and their beliefs and values. The decision-making process should involve, when appropriate, family, carers, and significant others.</li><li>The least restrictive alternative — when a decision is made on the person's behalf, the healthcare professional must choose the alternative that interferes least with the person's rights and freedoms while still achieving the necessary goal.</li></ul></li><li><strong>To assess capacity, confirm that the person has an impairment of the mind or brain, </strong>which means they are unable to:<ul><li>Understand relevant information about the decision to be made,</li><li>Retain that information,</li><li>Use or weigh that information as part of the decision-making process, <em>or</em></li><li>Communicate their decision (by talking, non-verbal communication, or any other means).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Healthcare professionals should understand:</strong><ul><li>The Mental Capacity Act (2005) applies in England and Wales.</li><li>The Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act (2000) applies in Scotland.

Healthcare professionals are, however, able to give treatment regardless of whether parental consent has been given, as long as the principles of the Mental Capacity Act (2005) are followed, and the decision is judged to be in the young person's best interests.</li><li>If a young person who self-harms and has capacity refuses to involve their family or carers in their treatment, or refuses consent to disclose issues relating to their safety to family or carers, healthcare professionals must weigh the young person's right to confidentiality (and risk to the therapeutic relationship if confidentiality is breached) against providing family and carers with sufficient information to protect and care for the young person.

In the absence of specific guidance relating to general practice, the information on how to carry out such assessments is extrapolated from information provided by NICE on the integrated and comprehensive assessment of needs and risks carried out in community mental health services and other specialist mental health settings [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/self-harm/references/\">NICE, 2004</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/self-harm/references/\">NICE, 2011</a>].</li></ul><h5>Assessing mental capacity</h5><ul><li>The key principles of the Mental Capacity Act derive from the British Medical Association's guidance <em>The Mental Capacity Act 2005: guidance for health professionals </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/self-harm/references/\">BMA, 2009b</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to refer the person for an urgent mental health assessment or hospital admission if they are judged to have diminished capacity and/or the presence of a significant mental health disorder is pragmatic advice based on what CKS considers to be good medical practice. CKS acknowledges that diminished capacity may have multiple causes, including drugs, alcohol, and acute delirium, as well as mental health states, such as psychosis, and the person's place of care will depend on the likely underlying cause at the time of presentation.</li></ul><h5>Capacity and confidentiality issues in young people aged 16–17 years</h5><ul><li>The information about capacity and confidentiality issues in young people who self-harm is based on expert opinion in the NICE guideline <em>Self-harm: longer-term management </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/self-harm/references/\">NICE, 2011</a>] and the Department of Health guideline <em>Seeking consent: working with children </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/self-harm/references/\">DH, 2001</a>], and has been highlighted as this group may have a number of special needs owing to their vulnerability and family circumstances.</li></ul><h5>The Mental Health Act (1983)</h5><ul><li>The information about the Mental Health Act derives from the guideline <em>Reference Guide to the Mental Health Act 1983 </em>produced by the Department of Health [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/self-harm/references/\">DH, 2015</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field ddcb09dc-90bb-4200-be3e-32d922cd00f1 --><!-- end item 5170f2fd-6115-4c62-a7b2-4c42cc92ce16 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"569f3681-e977-5971-8446-daa1897a7cf1","slug":"initial-follow-up","fullItemName":"Initial follow up","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 7f76b83c-09ee-491b-9aad-e49d75c80eba --><h3>Initial follow up</h3><!-- end field 7f76b83c-09ee-491b-9aad-e49d75c80eba -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 65f3d6d0-5e4c-4ab2-9fda-0ef688de35f2 --><!-- begin field a526f2ef-2f44-4129-8f32-038686a9af28 --><ul><li><strong>Ensure follow up </strong>has been offered in primary care to all people who have self-harmed within 48 hours, where appropriate.</li><li><strong>Ensure the person has had a full assessment of their </strong><strong><a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/self-harm/management/acute-management-following-an-act-of-self-harm/#initial-management\">psychosocial needs and risk</a>.</strong></li><li><strong>Manage any psychosocial needs </strong><strong>identified by this assessment:</strong><ul><li>Ensure the person has been referred to the community mental health team or drug and alcohol services for further treatment and support, if necessary.</li><li>Offer financial and occupational rehabilitation advice, where appropriate.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Manage any mental health problems that have been identified. </strong>For further information, see the CKS topics on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/generalized-anxiety-disorder/\">Generalized anxiety disorder</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression/\">Depression</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/depression-antenatal-postnatal/\">Depression - antenatal and postnatal</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/psychosis-schizophrenia/\">Psychosis and schizophrenia</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/bipolar-disorder/\">Bipolar disorder</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/\">Post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/dementia/\">Dementia</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/alcohol-problem-drinking/\">Alcohol - problem drinking</a>, and <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/opioid-dependence/\">Opioid dependence</a>.</li><li><strong>Prevent access to any means of self-harm, </strong>where possible.
