Onset of gout in a person younger than 30 years of age suggests renal or enzymatic disorders and is often associated with genetic causes.</li><li>Gout is an independent risk factor for chronic kidney disease, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular disease mortality.</li><li>Acute attacks of gout usually completely subside in 1-2 weeks without treatment. However, attacks may recur.</li><li>The diagnosis of gout is usually based on the clinical history and examination. A definitive diagnosis can be made by synovial fluid analysis but this is usually not practical in primary care.</li><li>To manage an acute attack of gout:<ul><li>Acute attacks should be treated as early as possible, usually with either a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), continued until 1-2 days after the attack has resolved (with gastroprotection) or oral colchicine.</li><li>Use of systemic corticosteroids is a therapeutic option if colchicine and NSAIDs are not appropriate.</li><li>Paracetamol can be considered as an adjunct for pain relief.</li><li>Appropriate self-care advice should be given (e.g. rest and keeping the joint in a cool environment).</li><li>Appropriate lifestyle advice should be provided (e.g. weight loss and smoking cessation).</li></ul></li><li>If there is an inadequate response to treatment after 1-2 days:<ul><li>The diagnosis should be reviewed.</li><li>Compliance with medications and self-care strategies should be checked.</li><li>Medication can be increased to the maximum dose or a combination of treatments can be considered.</li></ul></li><li>To prevent an attack of gout:<ul><li>Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) should be discussed and offered to all people with a diagnosis of gout.</li><li>ULT should be advised particularly for people with two or more attacks of gout within a year <em>or</em> in people with tophi, chronic gouty arthritis, joint damage, renal impairment, known urinary stones, long-term diuretic medication or young age of onset.</li><li>Allopurinol is the recommended first-line urate-lowering agent. Febuxostat can be considered as second-line therapy, if allopurinol is not tolerated or contraindicated.</li><li>Co-prescription of low-dose colchicine or a low dose of an NSAID may prevent acute attacks of gout during urate-lowering treatment with allopurinol or febuxostat.</li><li>Allopurinol or febuxostat should be started after the acute attack has resolved.</li><li>ULT is usually lifelong.</li></ul></li><li>Advice should be sought from a specialist if:<ul><li>The diagnosis is uncertain.</li><li>There is an underlying systemic illness.</li><li>Gout occurs during pregnancy or in a person under 30 years of age.</li><li>There are persistent symptoms despite treatment.</li><li>ULT is required but allopurinol and febuxostat are not tolerated, contraindicated or inadequate in lowering serum uric acid levels to target.</li><li>Complications are present.</li><li>The person is at risk of adverse effects of drug treatment.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field
