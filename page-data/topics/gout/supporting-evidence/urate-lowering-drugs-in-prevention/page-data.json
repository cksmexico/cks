This suggested that febuxostat (80 mg and 120 mg daily) was significantly more effective than fixed dose allopurinol (300 mg or 100 mg daily) at lowering serum uric acid (SUA) level to target therapeutic levels of less than 6 mg/100 ml (p <= 0.05). Post-hoc subgroup analysis of the pooled data also confirmed the increased effectiveness of febuxostat compared with allopurinol.<!--_3d_--></li><li>No statistically significant difference was seen between the febuxostat and allopurinol groups in the proportion of people needing treatment for acute flares of gout.</li></ul></li><li>However, NICE identified methodological limitations in the manufacturer's use of fixed-dose allopurinol as a comparator in the pooled data analysis, as current recommendations support the use of dose-titrated allopurinol according to therapeutic targets (up to a maximum of 900 mg daily). Also, pooling of the data did not preserve randomization of the original trial RCT evidence, which may have introduced bias. A subsequent meta-analysis by NICE of the RCT evidence still supported the use of febuxostat compared with fixed-dose allopurinol in lowering SUA level. NICE also identified uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness analyses by the manufacturer.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Subsequent to the NICE technology appraisal, CKS identified 5 further studies and a technology appraisal on the use of febuxostat.</p><ul><li>The CONfirmation of Febuxostat in Reducing and Maintaining Serum urate (CONFIRMS) trial (a randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority study) compared febuxostat 80 mg and febuxostat 40 mg with allopurinol 300 mg (or 200 mg for people with an estimated creatinine clearance of 30–59 mL/min) for 6 months in people with gout. The study recruited 2269 participants, 276 of whom were known treatment-responders from previous studies (FOCUS and EXCEL studies). The primary outcome measure was the proportion of participants achieving a final-visit SUA below 360 micromols/L [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Becker et al, 2010</a>].<ul><li>The proportion of participants that achieved a final-visit SUA below 360 micromols/L was greater with febuxostat 80 mg than with febuxostat 40 mg (67.1% compared with 45.2%, p < 0.001) and allopurinol (42.1%, p < 0.001).</li><li>Febuxostat 40 mg was considered to be non-inferior to allopurinol.</li><li>Compared with allopurinol, it appeared that more participants in the febuxostat group had flares requiring treatment (about 59% with 80 mg febuxostat and 51% with 40 mg febuxostat, compared with 41% with allopurinol).</li></ul></li><li>A 5 year open-label extension study (n = 116) assessed the urate lowering and clinical efficacy and safety of long-term febuxostat treatment in people with gout [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Schumacher et al, 2009</a>]. Participants who had previously completed a 28-day phase 2 RCT (the FOCUS study Febuxostat Open-label Clinical trial of Urate-lowering efficacy and Safety) were given febuxosat 80 mg daily. Febuxostat dose could be increased to 120 mg or decreased to 40 mg between weeks 4 and 24 in order to maintain SUA between 3 and 6 mg/100ml, to respond to an adverse event, or at the discretion of the investigator. The primary end-point was reduction to and maintenance of SUA levels less than 6 mg/100 ml. All participants received gout prophylaxis in the first 4 weeks. Gout flares were recorded and treated throughout the study, and SUA, baseline tophi and safety of febuxostat were monitored. Dose adjustments were made for 44 participants. Therefore, 8 participants received febuxostat 40 mg, 79 received febuxostat 80 mg, and 29 received febuxostat 120 mg.<ul><li>Fifty percent of the participants (58 participants) prematurely discontinued the study. Thirteen participants withdrew because of an adverse effect and eight participants withdrew because of gout flares.</li><li>After 5 yrs of taking febuxostat, 93% of the remaining participants (54 out of 58 people) had SUA less 6 mg/100 ml and the number of participants that experienced gout flares declined to zero. Long-term maintenance of SUA at a level less than 6.0 mg/dl also resulted in the resolution of baseline tophi in the majority of subjects.</li><li>Limitations of the study include:<ul><li>High drop out rate (50%) which may skew the results towards a greater reduction in gout flares.</li><li>Small sample size.</li><li>Method of assessment of flares and tophi. In the study, assessment of flares was subjective (relied on self-reports and confirmation by documentation of treatment) and was determined by individual investigators.</li><li>Study design — participants were not randomized to dose groups and dose titration was allowed. In addition, there was no control or comparator group.</li></ul></li><li>The authors concluded that longer term studies comparing various doses of febuxostat with allopurinol are needed to establish the long term benefits of these drugs.</li></ul></li><li>A retrospective study assessed the safety of febuxostat in 13 people with gout with prior documented severe allopurinol reactions [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Chohan, 2011</a>].<ul><li>Febuxostat was well tolerated in 12 of the 13 people.</li><li>One person who was previously hospitalized with documented exfoliative erythroderma during allopurinol treatment, developed biopsy-confirmed cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis. However, this was not definitively related to febuxostat use.</li><li>None of the other 12 people treated with febuxostat showed rash, worsening hepatic function, blood cytopenia or eosinophilia.</li><li>The authors concluded that the use of febuxostat in people with previously documented severe allopurinol adverse effects is largely safe. However, the small risk of development of a hypersensitivity type cutaneous vasculitis early in treatment mandates caution, careful dose escalation, and close monitoring when febuxostat is considered in allopurinol-intolerant people.</li></ul></li><li>A secondary analysis of data from the CONFIRMS trial assessed the safety and efficacy of febuxostat and allopurinol in older people compared with younger people [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Becker et al, 2011</a>].<ul><li>Among 374 older people (65 years or older) with gout, recommended doses of febuxostat or allopurinol were at least comparable to that in 1894 younger participants (younger than 65 years of age).</li><li>Febuxostat and allopurinol were also well tolerated despite high rates of renal impairment and cardiovascular comorbidities in the older participants.</li></ul></li><li>A retrospective study compared the characteristics of female compared with male participants with gout. The study also assessed the urate lowering efficacy and safety of febuxostat and allopurinol in women with gout [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Chohan et al, 2012</a>]. The study was a retrospective analysis of 4,101 people with gout (SUA level 8.0 mg/dl or more) enrolled in 3 phase III comparative trials and randomized to receive placebo, febuxostat (40 mg, 80 mg, 120 mg, or 240 mg daily), or allopurinol (100 mg, 200 mg, or 300 mg daily, based on renal function). Urate-lowering efficacy, which was defined as the proportion of subjects with SUA levels less than 6.0 mg/dl at final visit, was assessed for all subjects and, among women, according to baseline renal function.<ul><li>The female participants (n = 226) were older with significantly higher rates of obesity and metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities than the male participants.</li><li>The percentage of female participants with SUA levels less than 6.0 mg/dl at final visit was:<ul><li>0% in the placebo group.</li><li>54.3%, 85.1%, 81.0%, and 100.0% in the febuxostat 40 mg, 80 mg, 120 mg, and 240 mg groups, respectively.</li><li>45.9% in the allopurinol group.</li></ul></li><li>Similar patterns of urate-lowering efficacy rates were observed when stratified by renal function.</li><li>Results showed that among all the female participants, febuxostat 80 mg was significantly more efficacious than allopurinol (p</li></ul></li><li>The technology appraisal presented a summary of their evidence review group (ERG) report on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of febuxostat for the management of hyperuricaemia in people with gout.
