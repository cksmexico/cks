The evidence supporting the BSR recommendations is based on a systematic review of literature [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Hui, 2017</a>]. The evidence in this area is limited and comes from small observational studies.</p><ul><li>The BSR recommend considering adjusting the dose of allopurinol to maintain a less stringent SUA target when successfully treated for some years. This is based on expert opinion as there is limited evidence suggesting that low SUA levels may be associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative disorders [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Hui, 2017</a>].</li><li>Discontinuing allopurinol or febuxostat is not common practice but a trial free period may be a pragmatic approach in an elderly person who has remained symptom-free from gout for years, but who takes multiple medications for comorbidities.</li><li>An observational study (n = 109) suggested that the lower the serum uric acid level prior to stopping urate-lowering therapy, the longer the person will remain free of gout [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Perez-Ruiz et al, 2006</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to consider providing an advance prescription to treat future attacks is based on expert opinion in a guideline published by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommending that fully informed patients should be educated to self-medicate at the first sign of symptoms [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Richette, 2017</a>].</li></ul><h5>Starting a urate-lowering therapy (ULT)</h5><ul><li>Considering the use of a urate-lowering drug in all people with a diagnosis is recommended by the BSR and is based on expert opinion and evidence that joint crystal deposits are already established when a person presents with a first episode. This is felt to be even more important in people with pre-existing risk factors [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Hui, 2017</a>].</li><li>The BSR recommend that ULT is best initiated after a flare of gout has settled as it is better discussed when the patient is not in pain.<ul><li>However, a small RCT found no difference in pain or recurrence of flares when allopurinol (with flare prophylaxis) was initiated immediately [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Taylor, 2012</a>]. Consequently, the BSR state that the findings of this trial support initiation of ULT before inflammation has completely resolved should flares be so frequent that this is difficult [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Hui, 2017</a>]. As this trial looked at allopurinol use only, findings cannot be extrapolated to other more potent ULTs such as febuxostat [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Richette, 2017</a>].</li><li>Clinical observation suggests that starting prophylactic treatment too early after an attack (before 1-2 weeks after the inflammation has settled) can lead to a prolonged flare-up of gout.</li></ul></li><li>There is a lack of evidence specifically on the prevalence of gout flares following ULT initiation but RCTs assessing the use of prophylaxis indicates an increased risk of flares in placebo groups up to 6 months after ULT initiation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Latourte, 2014</a>].</li><li>Checking liver function tests prior to initiating febuxostat is recommended by the manufacturer [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">ABPI, 2017</a>].</li><li>An initial target serum uric acid level of less than 300 micromol/L is recommended by the BSR, although other European and international guidelines recommend less stringent levels of less than 360 micromol/L unless gout is severe [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Sivera, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Hui, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Richette, 2017</a>].</li></ul><h5>Choice of ULT</h5><ul><li>There is randomised control trial (RCT) evidence that allopurinol is effective at reducting urate levels [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Seth, 2014</a>] and in the UK, it is the recommended first-line urate-lowering drug [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Hui, 2017</a>].</li><li>Febuxostat has been demonstrated in RCTs to be more effective in lowering urate to recommended levels than allopurinol at a fixed dose of 300mg daily. This comparison has not been made when using up-titrating strategies [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Tayar, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Borghi, 2016</a>]. Therefore, the BSR continue to recommend allopurinol as first-line therapy until further data is available [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Hui, 2017</a>].<ul><li>The National Institiute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend febuxostat as a ULT in people with gout only if they are intolerant of or have contraindications to allopurinol<em> </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">NICE, 2008b</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Gout flare prophylaxis</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to consider gout flare prophylaxis when initiating ULTs is based on data from 2 RCTs demonstrating a reduction in flare frequency in people receiving low dose colchicine (500 micrograms daily) following initiation of ULT. Less evidence exists on NSAIDs for prophylaxis although these are routinely used in practice.</li><li>The BSR recommend a duration of prophylaxis using colchicine for up to 6 months, and that a low-dose NSAID or coxib can be used as an alternative if colchicine cannot be tolerated. This is based on retrospective analysis of phase III trials of febuxostat, which indicated greater benefit for prophylaxis using low-dose colchicine or naproxen for up to 6 months in comparison to 8 weeks following initiation of ULT.<ul><li>The manufacturers of allopurinol recommend that a prophylactic NSAID or colchicine is co-prescribed for at least 1 month when starting allopurinol [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">ABPI Medicines Compendium, 2017a</a>]. The British National Formulary (BNF) recommends that gout flare prophylaxis treatment is given until at least 1 month after hyperuricaemia is corrected (usually for around 3 months) when using allopurinol [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">BNF 74, 2017</a>]</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Primary prevention of gout in people with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia</h5><ul><li>The recommendation that primary prevention of gout in people with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia is not recommended is based on a multinational guideline on the diagnosis and management of gout [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Sivera, 2014</a>] and is based on limited cohort studies which do not demonstrate a difference in renal disease outcome, if treated. No evidence is currently available to assess risk of gout or cardiovascular disease outcomes.</li></ul><!-- end field ab9558fa-e42f-481f-8934-92bbe08d81cd --><!-- end item aa62e78e-4fe7-45c0-a8c6-42bd3c4f2cf7 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"f2242264-7eaa-557e-b126-01db9f2c4219","slug":"lifestyle-advice","fullItemName":"Lifestyle advice","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 329e3726-41de-46e4-8e85-08a1f1d9aedc --><h3>What lifestyle advice is recommended in someone with gout?</h3><!-- end field 329e3726-41de-46e4-8e85-08a1f1d9aedc -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item c369971c-a714-4eaf-a904-690a6ecee41e --><!-- begin field ee060389-f36f-4d24-b8b5-9a7897df1947 --><ul><li>Advise people with gout to:<ul><li>Aim for an ideal body weight if overweight, using dietary modification to achieve a gradual weight reduction — but avoid 'crash' dieting.</li><li>Eat sensibly — encourage a well-balanced diet which is low in fat and added sugar, and high in fibre and vegetables.
