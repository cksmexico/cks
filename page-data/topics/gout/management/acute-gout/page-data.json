High-dose colchicine was found to result in more gastrointestinal adverse effects than low-dose colchicine (diarrhoea and vomiting) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Van Echteld, 2014</a>].</li><li><strong>Systemic corticosteroids: </strong><ul><li>Two trials identified in a Cochrane review comparing NSAIDs and oral corticosteroids to treat acute gout demonstrated equal benefit in pain reduction and no difference in total adverse effects [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Van Durme, 2014</a>].</li><li>No RCTs were identified in a 2013 Cochrane review on the use of intra-articular corticosteroids in the management of acute gout [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gout/references/\">Wechalekar, 2013</a>].
