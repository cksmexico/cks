These are frequently seen in severe acne. They may become inflamed and tender intermittently and discharge pus.</li><li><strong>Folliculitis </strong>— a superficial infection of the hair follicles, which develop into small inflammatory papules or pustules. </li><li><strong>Hidradenitis suppurativa </strong>— a chronic inflammatory suppurative disease of the apocrine sweat glands causing painful, inflamed nodules and sterile abscesses. Consider this if only the groin and the axillae are involved.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Rare conditions that may resemble a boil or carbuncle include:</strong><ul><li><strong>Anthrax </strong>— can resemble a carbuncle, but lesions have a distinctive haemorrhagic crust and vesicular margin.</li><li><strong>Atypical mycobacterial infection </strong>— initially there is a solitary nodule or a pustule that may form an ulcer or abscess. Lesions are often multiple. The source of infection is often a swimming pool or a tropical fish tank.</li><li><strong>Ecthyma </strong>— small bullae or pustules on a reddish base are soon covered by a hard crust of dried exudate which increases in size. The base may become hard, and the lesion is often surrounded by a red, swollen areola. Removal of the crust is difficult and reveals an irregular purulent ulcer. Healing occurs after a few weeks, leaving a scar. Ecthyma is associated with poor hygiene and malnutrition. The most common organisms are group A streptococci and coagulase-positive staphylococci.</li><li><strong>Kerion </strong>— a raised, boggy lesion of the scalp. It is due to an intense inflammatory reaction to ringworm which is then secondarily infected. There may be follicles discharging pus and formation of sinuses, and sometimes a large confluent lesion may involve a large part of the scalp.</li><li><strong>Myiasis </strong>— this is a caused by subcutaneous larval invasion by the tumbu fly in Africa (lesions on buttocks and trunk), and the botfly in subtropical and tropical areas of the Americas (lesions on the scalp, face, and extremities). The larvae form and develop within a boil-like swelling 1–2 cm in diameter.</li><li><strong>Orf </strong>— is caused by parapoxvirus and is often associated with contact with sheep or goats. It presents as a small, firm, painful, red or red-blue lump that enlarges to form a flat-topped, blood-tinged pustule or blister that is usually 2–3 cm in diameter but may be as large as 5 cm across. Lesions usually occur on the hands, fingers, and forearms.</li><li><strong>Osteomyelitis </strong>— on an arm or leg, the most distal portion of a fistulous tract from an underlying osteomyelitis may resemble a boil.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 588a78e9-1838-49cd-aef0-32c0112ae859 --><!-- end item 91c97d8d-8635-4081-83ff-6c9958071130
