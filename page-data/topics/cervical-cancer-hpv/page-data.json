Changes may regress, but this becomes less likely as the disease progresses.</li><li>Usually the progress is gradual (over 10 years), and the development of cervical cancer is amenable to detection and control through the cervical screening programme.</li><li>The two most important risk factors for cervical cancer are:<ul><li>Acquiring HPV infection, particularly types 16 and 18.</li><li>Inadequate cervical screening.</li></ul></li><li>The risk of acquiring HPV infection depends on:<ul><li>The number of sexual partners.</li><li>The age at first sexual intercourse.</li><li>The likelihood that the woman's partner or partners were infected with HPV.</li><li>Whether or not a condom is used.</li></ul></li><li>Many women with cervical cancer will be asymptomatic. The possibility of cervical cancer should be considered in a woman who has any of the following nonspecific symptoms:<ul><li>Intermenstrual bleeding.</li><li>Postcoital bleeding.</li><li>Postmenopausal bleeding.</li><li>Blood-stained vaginal discharge.</li><li>Pelvic pain/dyspareunia.</li></ul></li><li>Rarely, women may present with advanced cancer with symptoms such as pelvic discomfort or pain, renal failure, leakage of urine or faeces from a fistula, lymphoedema, or severe haemorrhage.</li><li>On examination:<ul><li>The cervix may appear inflamed or friable and bleed on contact (although the most likely cause for this will be infection with <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>).</li><li>There may be a visible ulcerating or fungating lesion, or a foul-smelling serosanguineous vaginal discharge.</li></ul></li><li>Referral for fast-track colposcopy should be arranged for all women in whom there appears to be a visible suspicion of cervical cancer, and for women with a positive hrHPV test and an abnormal cervical cytology sample.</li><li>An urgent referral to gynaecology (within 2 weeks) should be arranged for postmenopausal women who:<ul><li>Have not received hormonal replacement therapy and have vaginal bleeding.</li><li>Have persistent or unexplained vaginal bleeding after cessation of hormone replacement therapy for 6 weeks.</li></ul></li><li>Referral to gynaecology or to a genitourinary medicine clinic should be arranged for premenopausal women who have:<ul><li>Persistent intermenstrual bleeding, post-coital bleeding, or blood-stained vaginal discharge, and </li><li>Infection has been excluded or treated, but the bleeding has continued for 6–8 weeks post treatment, or a polyp, ectropion, cervicitis, or warts are present.</li></ul></li><li>Urgent referral (within 2 weeks) should be considered for women with persistent intermenstrual bleeding and a negative pelvic examination.</li><li>Staging of cervical cancer is based on the FIGO staging system that is universally used worldwide. In the UK, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography (PET) are also used to assess the extent of the disease and to make treatment decisions.</li></ul><!-- end field ee681bc3-069c-405b-b334-90b4c9c8ef37 --><!-- end item 0f98be75-b5d0-4b1c-b116-bbe1fc3ae51c -->","topic":{"id":"38328a3b-8997-55f8-afac-19e980523812","topicId":"e2dafa6e-4749-48b2-b981-fa906c90d627","topicName":"Cervical cancer and HPV","slug":"cervical-cancer-hpv","aliases":["HPV and cervical cancer"],"chapters":[{"id":"417b3c03-a940-5eb6-8b35-698036862be5","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"b4186a4a-8c1e-51ad-9743-d00be5b18f3d","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"c2a58da0-8965-5522-8b3d-618890f730d3","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"2a436c60-1809-5f9f-bf39-409fd07e7af5","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"6b2a8979-8ca9-5087-a80b-ea14445c034a","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"c207e9ef-e492-5e67-8986-8b48ff76c55f","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"4e791e8f-015d-58bd-99ec-2689c4baa3e4","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"b04fb3a0-7363-5d87-b475-a7ad1e7ca9af","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"af911672-6dba-57d0-b3bf-4058c30f91ff","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"16911bc4-aa1d-56b2-aaf3-39695a5692f3","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"9c781faa-cf3f-5dcc-b39d-4c10588cbbfb","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
