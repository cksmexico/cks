The most classical is dysphagia, often accompanied by pain, acid reflux, loss of appetite, and loss of weight. Anaemia may occur.</li><li>A small percentage of oesophageal cancers are identified during endoscopic surveillance of a precursor lesion, Barrettâ€™s oesophagus.</li><li>The symptoms overlap with stomach cancer, but the usual investigative strategy, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, is the same for both cancers.</li><li>Most oesophageal cancers can be identified on endoscopy, and a biopsy taken. This can be under the clinical responsibility of primary care, though the procedure is usually performed in secondary care. Older imaging techniques, such as barium swallow are rarely used.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Pancreatic cancer:</strong><ul><li>Pancreatic cancer can present with a number of different symptoms, and there are often multiple symptoms simultaneously. Symptoms include pain, loss of appetite, and loss of weight. Lesions near the head of the pancreas may lead to obstructive jaundice. Endocrine cancers may produce symptoms from secretion of hormones such as insulin.</li><li>There is no standard pathway for all features of possible pancreatic cancer.</li><li>CT provides more complete assessment for pancreatic cancer although ultrasound may also be of some use. Interpretation of pancreatic imaging is often performed by sub-specialist radiologists.</li><li>Definitive diagnosis requires biopsy, often guided by imaging. This is performed in secondary care.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Stomach cancer:</strong><ul><li>Stomach cancer can present with a number of different symptoms, including dysphagia, pain, acid reflux, loss of appetite, and loss of weight. Anaemia may also be a presenting feature.</li><li>The symptoms overlap with oesophageal cancer, but the usual investigative strategy, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, is the same for both cancers.</li><li>Most stomach cancers can be identified on endoscopy, and a biopsy taken. In some areas, this is currently available under the clinical responsibility of primary care. Older imaging techniques, such as barium meal, are rarely used.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Small intestinal cancer:</strong><ul><li>This is a rare cancer of the duodenum, jejunum, or ileum, with different histological subtypes.</li><li>Small intestinal cancer may present with similar symptoms to stomach or colorectal cancers.</li><li>The main method of diagnosis is by biopsy, which is performed in secondary care.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Gallbladder cancer:</strong><ul><li>Pain and jaundice are thought to be the main presenting symptoms of gallbladder cancer.</li><li>Due to the rarity of gallbladder cancer there is no standard diagnostic pathway.</li><li>Ultrasound in primary care may show abnormalities suggestive of cancer, but definitive diagnosis requires biopsy, which is performed in secondary care.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Liver cancer:</strong><ul><li>Primary liver cancer often presents as a complication of cirrhosis, usually following chronic viral hepatitis or alcoholic liver disease. Pain and worsening of liver function, enlargement of the liver, and jaundice are thought to be the main presenting symptoms of liver cancer.</li><li>Liver cancer may be identified on ultrasound or other imaging techniques, although definitive diagnosis requires biopsy, which is performed in secondary care.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/gastrointestinal-tract-upper-cancers-recognition-referral/references/\">National Collaborating Centre for Cancer, 2015</a>]</p><!-- end field e05064ee-61a1-4fe6-94a1-61967beae1e2 --><!-- end item afc86f7d-8ad8-433f-b76d-4abface7f267 -->","topic":{"id":"c0e52ca7-e4e6-57cf-956e-49b2d52e7d08","topicId":"adc668ab-d08a-4b55-8d9a-ca8875f39904","topicName":"Gastrointestinal tract (upper) cancers - recognition and referral","slug":"gastrointestinal-tract-upper-cancers-recognition-referral","lastRevised":"Last revised in February 2021","chapters":[{"id":"a2cfcf1a-dd0a-58de-9d65-a14fa0ad0611","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"a3e084f4-a122-57ce-a6da-caed2683d20d","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"058be16f-48e8-5946-9481-9d3f25e3c6f8","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"f8cfe9e0-9c59-544c-9f31-c2a103f9b4dd","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"fc0a6327-8ba0-5978-8a93-eefed940247e","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"be218b53-cc26-526d-bdfa-7d394e21046f","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"713deae5-bfaa-5c7f-87e0-20e4818e1c17","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"516b9d0a-3400-5ebf-ac16-4c1e2f5a483f","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"b748365f-e9ba-5dc0-a061-373c7bb0b109","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"b2e77fa2-ef8b-5df1-8a1d-fc1e0e616f5d","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"a9191f80-3641-5343-8f91-eddd725989ce","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP - Options for local implementation"},{"id":"3191983f-c2ee-5192-b67f-e6cacbd35f74","slug":"nice-quality-standards","fullItemName":"NICE quality standards"}]},{"id":"6fedd70e-962e-5b60-b3cb-8400e02fd4ed","fullItemName":"Background information","slug":"background-information","subChapters":[{"id":"8a69b30a-4142-5df1-b2bd-51eee5f6134a","slug":"presentation","fullItemName":"Presentation"},{"id":"88aee075-241b-593f-a538-7ffbd9ec9e15","slug":"prevalence","fullItemName":"Prevalence"},{"id":"d0cc9052-0ee0-57bd-ad6c-f81913f8f7a3","slug":"prognosis","fullItemName":"Prognosis"}]},{"id":"bb00d2b7-f67c-50b2-8569-8db8ae3bc28e","fullItemName":"Diagnosis","slug":"diagnosis","subChapters":[{"id":"cd857acb-3b7b-517b-81ab-4c6d987c9da2","slug":"symptoms-suggestive-of-gastrointestinal-tract-upper-cancers","fullItemName":"Symptoms suggestive of gastrointestinal tract (upper) cancers"}]},{"id":"aaa7d395-4776-5e16-9d4a-beb0d6b5f6b8","fullItemName":"Management","slug":"management","subChapters":[{"id":"7dbaa93e-1641-5da9-af1b-01669960ddca","slug":"referral-for-suspected-gastrointestinal-tract-upper-cancer","fullItemName":"Scenario: Referral for suspected gastrointestinal tract (upper) cancer"}]},{"id":"1c7f610c-f9a4-5c36-be37-5736fa1b44b0","fullItemName":"Supporting evidence","slug":"supporting-evidence","subChapters":[]},{"id":"d5ad8463-0ff9-5567-84a3-a764033c98e1","fullItemName":"How this topic was developed","slug":"how-this-topic-was-developed","subChapters":[{"id":"fd13b6b3-769c-5bbb-8dad-5d1c319d298f","slug":"search-strategy","fullItemName":"Search strategy"},{"id":"452a6076-6e1d-5123-a7a3-5fbba13974f4","slug":"stakeholder-engagement","fullItemName":"Stakeholder engagement"},{"id":"c01b41ad-4c6c-5422-ace3-35dc70592327","slug":"evidence-exclusion-criteria","fullItemName":"Evidence exclusion criteria"},{"id":"dde14ffc-d71a-51bd-86b4-ac13299fea67","slug":"organizational-behavioural-financial-barriers","fullItemName":"Organizational, behavioural and financial barriers"},{"id":"a0601029-a606-50a9-89b6-405a04ad4207","slug":"declarations-of-interest","fullItemName":"Declarations of interest"}]},{"id":"302b38de-05b4-5eea-9578-528408177c1e","fullItemName":"References","slug":"references","subChapters":[]}]},"parentChapter":{"id":"6fedd70e-962e-5b60-b3cb-8400e02fd4ed","slug":"background-information","fullItemName":"Background information"},"subChapters":[]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
