However, recent studies have shown that reasonable levels of pertussis antibodies are present in neonates through transplacental transfer from mothers vaccinated earlier in pregnancy. As a result, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has recommended that women should be offered pertussis-containing vaccine between gestational weeks 16 and 32 to maximise the likelihood that the baby will be protected from birth.</li><li>Offering the vaccine from week 16 of pregnancy gives pregnant women greater opportunity to take up the offer of vaccination and will offer some protection to infants born prematurely who may be particularly vulnerable to complications from pertussis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/antenatal-care-uncomplicated-pregnancy/references/\">PHE, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li><li><strong>Influenza immunization</strong><ul><li>There is evidence that women may be at increased risk of complications (such as pneumonia if they contract influenza infection during pregnancy, and infection may be associated with preterm birth and smaller infant size at birth. Vaccination in pregnancy can also protect the neonate due to transplacental transfer of antibodies [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/antenatal-care-uncomplicated-pregnancy/references/\">PHE, 2015a</a>].</li></ul></li><li><strong>Fetal anomaly screening</strong><ul><li>The information on fetal anomaly screening is based on expert opinion in the NHS guideline on the <em>Fetal anomaly screening programme</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/antenatal-care-uncomplicated-pregnancy/references/\">NHS Screening Programmes, 2010</a>] and a guideline from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) on <em>Temination of pregnancy for fetal abnormality</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/antenatal-care-uncomplicated-pregnancy/references/\">RCOG, 2010</a>].</li></ul></li><li><strong>Symphysis–fundal height</strong><ul><li>The recommendation to use symphysis-fundal height to identify large- or small-for-gestational-age babies is based on expert opinion from the NICE guideline development group.

Babies with anencephaly die in the womb or soon after birth.</td><td colspan=\"1\">98</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Open spina bifida</td><td colspan=\"1\">The spinal cord has not developed properly, and there is a gap or split in the spine.</td><td colspan=\"1\">90</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Cleft lip</td><td colspan=\"1\">A split in the lip that is due to parts of the baby’s face not joining together normally. Some affected babies also have a cleft palate (a split in the roof of the mouth).</td><td colspan=\"1\">75</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Diaphragmatic hernia</td><td colspan=\"1\">The baby’s diaphragm does not fully form, allowing the abdominal organs to push up into the chest and impede normal lung development.</td><td colspan=\"1\">60</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Gastroschisis</td><td colspan=\"1\">This is a defect or ‘hole’ in the baby’s abdominal wall to one side of the umbilical cord (usually the right side). Some of the bowel escapes through this hole and protrudes outside the baby's abdomen.</td><td colspan=\"1\">98</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Exomphalos</td><td colspan=\"1\">The abdomen fails to close around the base of the umbilical cord during the early development of the baby. This means that some organs (usually bowel and liver) protrude outside of the baby’s abdomen in a membranous sac.</td><td colspan=\"1\">80</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Serious cardiac abnormalities</td><td colspan=\"1\">A range of heart abnormalities that require medical attention very soon after the baby's birth.</td><td colspan=\"1\">50</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Bilateral renal agenesis</td><td colspan=\"1\">The baby’s kidneys have not developed. Because the baby does not produce urine in the womb, the level of amniotic fluid is low and the lungs also do not develop properly (babies in the womb 'breathe' amniotic fluid and this is required for normal lung development). Babies with this condition die shortly after birth.</td><td colspan=\"1\">84</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Lethal skeletal dysplasia</td><td colspan=\"1\">Affects the size and shape of arms, legs, the body, or sometimes the skull. The chest and lungs of these babies do not fully develop, which means that they do not survive.</td><td colspan=\"1\">60</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Edwards’ syndrome (trisomy 18)</td><td colspan=\"1\">A rare chromosomal disorder that occurs when a baby has three copies of chromosome 18 instead of two. Features include intrauterine growth retardation, craniofacial abnormalities, short sternum, congenital heart defects, and urogenital abnormalities. Most babies with Edwards syndrome die in the womb or soon after birth. Very rarely, some affected children survive until early adulthood but have severe disabilities.</td><td colspan=\"1\">95</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">Patau’s syndrome (trisomy 13)</td><td colspan=\"1\">A chromosomal disorder that occurs when a baby has three copies of chromosome 13 instead of two. Features include intrauterine growth retardation, craniofacial abnormalities, congenital heart defects (commonly ventricular septal defect and atrial septal defect) gastrointestinal abnormalities, urogenital abnormalities, pancreatic dysplasia, and brain abnormalities. Most babies with Patau's syndrome die in the womb or shortly after birth.</td><td colspan=\"1\">95</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Data from:</strong> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/antenatal-care-uncomplicated-pregnancy/references/\">PHE, 2015b</a>]</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- end field e5799718-5d21-4aab-91a8-1520e9514b54 --><!-- end item ca9baf38-2900-4db3-82d5-dcb0384b233e -->","subChapters":[{"id":"170ca445-1d8f-5d1c-9cb7-427d62f33bee","slug":"risks-limitations-of-ultrasound-scans","fullItemName":"Risks and limitations of ultrasound scans","depth":4,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field fbed5161-66f3-43bf-9abc-69bdc49a2044 --><h4>What advice can I give regarding the risks and limitations of a fetal anomaly scan?</h4><!-- end field fbed5161-66f3-43bf-9abc-69bdc49a2044 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 99602504-51b1-4b5d-bd4f-e5de3e7df6c0 --><!-- begin field c8385e39-ebc2-4e20-8495-e448b9d00017 --><ul><li><strong>Advise the parents that:</strong><ul><li>There are no known risks of a ultrasound scan;
