The recommendations on the time intervals for checking HbA1c levels and action to take if targets are not met are also based on the NICE clinical guideline. It found [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-2/references/\">NICE, 2020a</a>]: <ul><li>Moderate-quality evidence from one study that the risk for microvascular complications increased significantly with HbA1c levels above 48 mmol/mol (6.5%), and the risk for mortality and macrovascular complications increased significantly with HbA1c levels above 53 mmol/mol (7%). </li><li>Moderate- to high-quality evidence showed that all-cause mortality risk increased with increasing baseline levels of HbA1c.</li><li>Very low- to high-quality evidence showed that rising levels of HbA1c increased the risk of mortality and of developing macrovascular and microvascular complications, with critical thresholds ranging from 42–53 mmol/mol (6.0–7.0%).</li></ul></li><li>The NICE guideline development group recognized the trade-off between the increased benefits of setting target values for blood glucose to protect against long-term complications, and the possible associated harms, such as hypoglycaemia. Based on the evidence identified, it agreed that [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-2/references/\">NICE, 2020a</a>]:<ul><li>A mid-range value of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) would be achievable for most adults with type 2 diabetes who are managed by lifestyle and diet and/or one oral antidiabetic drug not associated with hypoglycaemia.  </li><li>Antidiabetic drug treatment should be intensified if HbA1c levels rise to 58 mmol/mol (7.5%), and considering the risk of hypoglycaemia, a realistic target of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) should be set to achieve blood glucose control. </li><li>Special consideration of appropriate target values should be given to people at risk of hypoglycaemia, to achieve an acceptable balance between good blood glucose control and the likely negative impact on quality of life of this adverse effect.</li></ul></li><li>The joint ESC/EASD guidelines also highlight that blood glucose control to a target less than 53 mmol/mol decreases the risk of microvascular complications in people with diabetes, based on data derived from multiple randomized controlled trials or meta-analyses. In addition, it recommends this target should be considered for the prevention of macrovascular complications but notes that the evidence for this is less compelling than for microvascular complications. It also recognizes the need to individualize blood glucose targets in the elderly, people with frailty, and/or multiple co-morbidities, based on limited evidence and consensus opinion [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-2/references/\">Cosentino, 2020</a>].</li><li>The ADA/EASD consensus report also states that optimal blood glucose control reduces the onset and progression of microvascular complications and highlights the need to individualize targets based on the person's preferences, risk of adverse effects, frailty, and co-morbid conditions. If treatment targets are not reached, it re-emphasizes the importance of lifestyle measures, assessing adherence to treatment, and arranging timely follow up [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-2/references/\">Davies, 2018</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels</h5><ul><li>The NICE guideline development group noted that while self-monitoring of blood glucose levels provides the potential for tight control and reduced risk of complications, the possible impact on hypoglycaemic episodes is important in determining its safety and acceptability [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-2/references/\">NICE, 2020a</a>].<ul><li>It found generally low-quality evidence that although a statistically significant difference was observed in HbA1c levels in favour of self-monitoring, the small reduction of less than 5 mmol/mol (0.5%; the threshold for minimal important difference) was not clinically significant. It therefore agreed that self-monitoring was not beneficial to people with type 2 diabetes, except certain groups of people, such as those using insulin therapy. </li><li>It highlighted clinical scenarios that may benefit from short-term self-monitoring of blood glucose, such as when starting corticosteroid treatment, but found no evidence that such monitoring is beneficial for people with acute intercurrent illness or infection, however, it highlighted the potential risk for worsening hyperglycaemia in these scenarios.</li><li>It recommended the need for regular review if a person is self-monitoring blood glucose levels but found inadequate evidence to make any recommendations on the frequency of self-monitoring, or on specific target values for people with type 2 diabetes.</li></ul></li><li>The joint ESC/EASD guidelines also recommend the use of structured self-monitoring of blood glucose level to optimize blood glucose control, if needed [<a

CKS has therefore extrapolated this recommendation from the NICE recommendations for the secondary prevention of CVD in the general population.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation to aim for a greater than 40% reduction in non-HDL cholesterol and consider up-titration of the atorvastatin dose to achieve this target, depending on clinical judgement, is based on the NICE clinical guideline on lipid modification [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-2/references/\">NICE, 2016a</a>].<br><ul><li>CKS notes that the joint ESC/EASD guidelines recommend different lipid LDL-C reductions and targets for people with type 2 diabetes [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-2/references/\">Cosentino, 2020</a>]. Similarly, the joint ABCD/RA guidance recommends aiming to reduce TC to 4 mmol/L, LDL cholesterol to 2 mmol/L, and non-HDL cholesterol to 2.5 mmol/L [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-2/references/\">Mark, 2017</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Antiplatelet treatment</h5><ul><li>The recommendation not to offer antiplatelet treatment for the primary prevention of CVD in adults with type 2 diabetes is based on the NICE clinical guideline on type 2 diabetes [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-2/references/\">NICE, 2020a</a>] and expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-2/references/\">Kenny, 2018</a>].<ul><li>NICE found low- to very-low quality evidence suggesting an increased risk of harm (including bleeding events) associated with the use of aspirin, and there was uncertainty around whether aspirin reduced the incidence of cardiovascular events. The guideline development group concluded that antiplatelet therapy would not be of sufficient benefit for the primary prevention of CVD in the majority of people with type 2 diabetes. It was felt that although reducing the risk of CVD and mortality are important in improving life expectancy and quality of life, the relative impact of adverse events associated with the off-label use of aspirin and clopidogrel for primary prevention was also important in determining the relative safety and acceptability of antiplatelet treatment.</li><li>This approach is supported by expert opinion in a review article that notes that aspirin should not be used for primary prevention, as the risks of adverse effects such as major bleeding events outweigh the benefits of CV risk reduction [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-2/references/\">Kenny, 2018</a>].</li></ul></li><li>CKS notes that the joint ESC/EASD guidelines differ from the NICE recommendations, and state that the use of aspirin may be considered for primary prevention in people with diabetes at very high/high risk of CVD if there are no contraindications, based on data derived from multiple RCTs or meta-analyses. It acknowledges that the role of aspirin for primary prevention in this group is less clear than its use for secondary prevention in people with established CVD [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/diabetes-type-2/references/\">Cosentino, 2020</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field 81288b38-6070-49a2-80fa-67f88df023b6 --><!-- end item c62d449e-e2ce-403d-a9cf-b93f4ccea5d0 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
