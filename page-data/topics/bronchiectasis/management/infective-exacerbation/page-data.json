people already taking a long-term antibiotic</h5><ul><li>The recommendation that people who are already taking long-term antibiotics and experience an exacerbation of bronchiectasis should stop the prophylactic antibiotic, take a course of antibiotic from another class to treat the exacerbation, then start a prophylactic antibiotic based on the results of sputum culture and sensitivity testing is pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li><li>NICE advises that when a person is receiving antibiotic prophylaxis, treatment for an acute exacerbation should be with an antibiotic from a different class [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bronchiectasis/references/\">NICE, 2019a</a>].</li></ul><h5>Use of bronchodilators [<a

with bronchiectasis is based on the BTS guideline (this is a grade D recommendation).<ul><li>There is limited supporting evidence for the use of bronchodilators in people with bronchiectasis, although both beta-2 agonists and anticholinergic bronchodilators are commonly used in clinical practice.</li><li>BTS states that long-acting beta-2 agonists and long-acting anticholinergics may be beneficial in people with symptoms of breathlessness but it found no evidence to support the use of short-acting beta-2 agonists, or to guide which bronchodilator treatment is the optimal strategy in bronchiectasis.</li></ul></li><li>BTS recommends that use of bronchodilators in people with bronchiectasis and co-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma should follow the
