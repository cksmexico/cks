Factors that have been associated with an increased risk of CTS include activities with high hand/wrist repetition rate, obesity, hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus.</li><li>CTS is the most common compression neuropathy of the upper limb and is more common in women than men.</li><li>CTS can affect activities of daily life (including work) and sleep due to symptoms of intermittent tingling, altered sensation, pain, weakness and impaired fine manipulation. Symptoms are often worse at night and can disrupt sleep.</li><li>Signs of CTS include sensory loss in the distribution of the median nerve (the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger), atrophy of the muscles of the thenar eminence, reduced strength of thumb abduction and dry skin on the thumb, index, and middle fingers.</li><li>Positive findings on clinical tests such as Phalen’s, Tinel’s and the carpal tunnel compression test support a diagnosis of CTS but should not be interpreted in isolation from the rest of the history and examination.</li><li>Investigations (such as blood tests or ultrasound scan) are only indicated in primary care if a specific underlying cause (such as hypothyroidism or ganglion cyst) is suspected.</li><li>Referral to secondary care for further assessment and treatment (with urgency depending on clinical judgement) is appropriate if:<ul><li>The diagnosis is unclear.</li><li>Symptoms are severe or functional ability is reduced.</li><li>Symptoms recur following carpal tunnel surgery.</li><li>Conservative management in primary care fails.</li><li>A serious alternative diagnosis such as neurological disease (such as multiple scleroisis or motor neurone disease), inflammatory arthritis, peripheral limb ischaemia or cervical nerve root entrapment is suspected.</li><li>The person requests a referral.</li></ul></li><li>Management in primary care involves:<ul><li>Optimizing treatment of any underlying condition, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or hypothyroidism.</li><li>Advising the person to modify their lifestyle (if possible) by avoiding repetitive movements and using ergonomic equipment. If CTS is work related the person should be advised to arrange assessment with their employer — in some cases, people disabled from work related CTS may be eligible for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit.</li><li>Wrist splinting (in a neutral position).</li><li>Corticosteroid injection (if appropriate expertise is available in primary care).</li><li>Monthly follow up to ensure that symptoms are resolving and to allow referral to specialist services if symptoms worsen, function is affected or conservative treatment in primary care fails.</li><li>Providing sources of information and support.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field f71e3a00-1b92-4598-a9dd-d424f57f1655 --><!-- end item 0155cbc6-b575-43f5-acbb-5c07ee535690 -->","topic":{"id":"414b5174-0792-56b3-9c3e-b1440e29ec6f","topicId":"5c49f319-6d62-40b6-a65b-cc5be1421d2b","topicName":"Carpal tunnel syndrome","slug":"carpal-tunnel-syndrome","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"ac5321b8-2c09-535b-95bd-ac79b3ec63c7","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"e9515b58-0c18-5d08-ba05-c1fca2079c30","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"7985b1c9-deb7-5e87-8cfa-66e0186b5c0c","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"78e08fcf-114e-5617-b696-c6b430a324be","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"94a13eee-3ae2-5168-9372-2a75e5ae2aa3","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"3a8760fa-c163-5041-946d-715a7b2249c6","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"3951831b-01ad-5088-871e-c94ed84f8be5","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"ee01f552-6417-5906-890f-62c88aab2389","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"d8cf1322-72d7-5291-bebb-4d4dfb8454c5","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"dd0d1722-7774-5a72-9df9-101613a27222","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"fc34c529-7264-56d1-baae-548d470ebbbd","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
