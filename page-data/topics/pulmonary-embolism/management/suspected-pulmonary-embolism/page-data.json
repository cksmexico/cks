Using the two-level PE Wells score, PE will be confirmed in around 12% and 50% of people in the PE-unlikely and PE-likely categories, respectively [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pulmonary-embolism/references/\">Konstantinides, 2016</a>].</li><li>Clinical prediction rules and D-dimer testing help guide decisions about who should be referred for imaging as it is neither feasible nor advisable to image every person with suspected PE, owing to potential harms of the procedure (including radiation exposure and the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy) and associated healthcare costs. In addition, in people with clinically suspected PE (or DVT), the prevalence of the disease is only about 20%, with a broad variation across countries and clinical settings (range 4–44%) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pulmonary-embolism/references/\">Di Nisio, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The Wells rule has not been evaluated in non-hospital primary care settings. Its generalizability to these settings may be questioned but CKS feels that this can be justified on the basis of the available evidence. <ul><li>In the initial derivation study for the Wells rule, chest X-ray, electrocardiography, and arterial blood gases were used to determine whether an alternative diagnosis was less likely [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pulmonary-embolism/references/\">Wells et al, 1998</a>]. Whilst these are not usually immediately available in primary care, their value is in excluding PE rather than in ruling it in. Their absence is likely to overestimate rather than underestimate the prevalence of PE, making the rule no less safe for use in non-hospital primary healthcare.</li><li>The prevalence of PE will be lower in non-hospital primary care than in emergency departments, so the predictive value of this diagnostic approach will be higher.</li></ul></li><li>D‐dimers are protein fragments released into the circulation when a blood clot breaks down as a result of normal body processes or with use of prescribed fibrinolytic medication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pulmonary-embolism/references/\">Crawford, 2016</a>].<ul><li>Plasma D-dimer levels are elevated in the presence of acute thrombosis because of simultaneous activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pulmonary-embolism/references/\">Konstantinides, 2014</a>].</li><li>The negative predictive value of D-dimer testing is high, and a normal D-dimer level means that acute PE or DVT is unlikely. However, because fibrin is also produced in a wide variety of conditions, such as pregnancy, cancer, inflammation, bleeding, trauma, surgery, and necrosis, the positive predictive value of elevated D-dimer levels is low, and D-dimer testing is not useful for confirmation of PE [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pulmonary-embolism/references/\">Konstantinides, 2014</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Choice of anticoagulant for interim therapeutic anticoagulation</h5><ul><li>NICE recommends that [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pulmonary-embolism/references/\">NICE, 2020</a>]:<ul><li>Interim therapeutic anticoagulation should be offered if CTPA cannot be carried out immediately in people whom PE is suspected with a likely Wells score, and in people with an unlikely Wells score if D-dimer test results cannot be obtained within 4 hours.</li><li>An anticoagulant should be chosen that can be continued if PE is confirmed.</li><li>People with confirmed PE should be offered apixaban or rivaroxaban first line, and if these are not suitable:<ul><li>Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for at least 5 days followed by dabigatran or edoxaban, <em>or</em></li><li>LMWH concurrently with a vitamin K antagonists for at least 5 days. </li></ul></li><li>Comorbidities, contraindications and the person's preferences should be taken into account when choosing anticoagulation treatment. </li></ul></li><li>Expert opinion in a guidance document <em>Guidance for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pulmonary-embolism/references/\">Streiff, 2016</a>] also suggests rivaroxaban or apixaban are suitable for the acute and short term treatment of VTE in appropriate people and this approach is supported by a primary care guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pulmonary-embolism/references/\">NHS Oxfordshire CCG, 2019</a>].<ul><li>Apixaban and rivaroxaban are convenient for initiation of treatment as the quick onset of action negates the need for parenteral therapy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pulmonary-embolism/references/\">OUH, 2019</a>].</li><li>Dabigatran and edoxaban are also options to treat PE, however, treatment should only be started following initial use of parenteral anticoagulation for at least 5 days [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/pulmonary-embolism/references/\">Joint Formulary Committee, 2019</a>]. </li><li>Note: the use of apixaban or rivaroxaban in people with suspected DVT is off-label.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field e3a8bf69-73e2-4fb8-8b63-f2f91405e4ed --><!-- end item 65808127-7df5-4300-90e9-c81f21fcf13c -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
