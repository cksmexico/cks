However, maternal infection in non-immune women during pregnancy can cause serious complications including miscarriage, stillbirth and severe birth defects known as Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS).<ul><li>The severity and type of congenital defect likely to develop vary according to the stage of pregnancy when infection occurs — before 8–10 weeks' gestation there is a high likelihood of multiple defects.</li></ul></li><li>As a result of the childhood immunization programme, rubella is now uncommon in the UK, and CRS is very rare.</li><li>No clinical features are specific to rubella — diagnosis must be confirmed with laboratory investigations.</li><li>Clinical features consistent with rubella infection include:<ul><li>Rash — typically starts on the face and neck before spreading down the body and becoming generalized — the rash is pink or light red, maculopapular and usually present for 3–5 days.</li><li>Lymphadenopathy (most often suboccipital, postauricular, and cervical) — may precede rash and last for 2 weeks after the rash resolves.</li><li>Arthritis and arthralgia — more common in adult women.</li><li>Non-specific symptoms such as low-grade fever, headache, malaise, nausea, mild upper respiratory tract symptoms and non-purulent conjunctivitis.</li></ul></li><li>Rubella should be suspected in people with clinical features consistent with infection or with risk factors such as incomplete immunization and no evidence of previous infection; history of exposure to contacts with rubella within the last 3 weeks or travel to an area endemic for rubella.<ul><li>A low threshold of suspicion for rubella in pregnant women is essential — rubella must always be excluded in pregnant women with rubella-like rash even when other causes are more likely and regardless of previous immunization history.</li></ul></li><li>Rubella is a notifiable disease.<ul><li>The local Health Protection Team should be notified immediately if there is any clinical suspicion of rubella — they will advise on appropriate investigations to confirm diagnosis.</li></ul></li><li>Non-pregnant people with rubella infection should be advised to:<ul><li>Rest, drink adequate fluids, and take paracetamol or ibuprofen (if appropriate) for symptomatic relief.</li><li>Stay away from school or work for at least 5 days after the initial development of the rash and avoid contact with pregnant women.</li></ul></li><li>Non-pregnant people who have been in contact with confirmed or suspected rubella should be advised to seek medical advice if they develop symptoms and avoid contact with pregnant women.</li><li>Pregnant women with confirmed rubella who are at a gestational age 20 weeks or less should be referred urgently to an obstetrician for risk-assessment and counselling.<ul><li>After 20 weeks gestational age there is no documented risk of congenital rubella syndrome.</li></ul></li><li>Pregnant women who have been in contact with possible rubella infection must have the diagnosis confirmed or excluded by the local Health Protection Team.</li></ul><!-- end field 5c61ce59-eeea-4920-938d-35d36dc27c92 --><!-- end item de85d505-f058-4336-800e-12c4d66fa380 -->","topic":{"id":"f4a4135e-ffdc-5df5-b074-abfbec05f014","topicId":"300947fe-8e33-4d94-bbba-f4d16a0ba0f4","topicName":"Rubella","slug":"rubella","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"3aff984b-cc64-5eef-a912-f7704fcdd2e0","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"48701a5d-fb3c-54ae-8a4d-d8ffb0b3fd08","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"9fe254c0-d336-5473-8be6-d3b58967643f","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"783a0842-a9d9-5ecf-aa6d-183b6bd947f8","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"0b45633f-1453-5f54-bd26-a5d793bb79e0","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"4e272831-90b9-5f58-8133-46358fd68bc3","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"71613e96-82dc-56c0-a022-916278e5d473","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"1b880ef4-fa9c-5899-a396-74128fb2bf51","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"bebe0c0e-b00e-5e4f-a9f0-bf76dc254163","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"98a30d33-4581-55fa-93c7-c24d96973f5b","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"a3a2016b-1d86-5856-be17-747a8db43be0","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
