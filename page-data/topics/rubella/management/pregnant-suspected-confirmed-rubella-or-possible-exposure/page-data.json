There is also a risk of hydrops fetalis, and regular ultrasound monitoring (and possible intrauterine fetal infusion) is recommended for those babies at risk [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/rubella/references/\">HPA, 2011b</a>].</li></ul></li><li>Depending on the specific clinical situation, the Health Protection Team may also recommend testing for other infections which can present with similar clinical features such as measles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/rubella/references/\">PHE, 2016a</a>].</li></ul><h5>Referral to obstetrics</h5><ul><li>Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is possible before 20 weeks of gestation, and very probable (and likely to be severe) in the first 10 weeks.

The authors found that compared to no treatment, polyclonal immunoglobulins appeared to be of benefit for preventing rubella up to five days after exposure. However, as none of the included studies reported congenital rubella infection as an outcome the authors concluded that there was insufficient evidence on the effectiveness of polyclonal immunoglobulins for preventing congenital rubella syndrome.</li></ul></li><li>Information on the likelihood of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is based on Public Health England guidance [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/rubella/references/\">HPA, 2011b</a>;
