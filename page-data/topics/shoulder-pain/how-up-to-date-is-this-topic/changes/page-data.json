A literature search was conducted in January 2016 to identify evidence-based guidelines, UK policy, systematic reviews, and key RCTs published since the last revision of the topic. Changes include:</p><ul><li>The differential diagnoses for shoulder pain has been revised.</li><li>The diagnosis section, 'How do I assess someone with shoulder pain?', has been added. The clinical assessment of someone with shoulder pain has been revised. The Hawkins test has been taken out of the examination, as this is not recommended in the <em>Oxford University hospitals guideline on the diagnosis of shoulder problems in primary care </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Oxford Shoulder Clinic, 2010</a>]. </li><li>A section regarding the initial management of a person with shoulder pain has been added. The criteria for emergency and urgent referral to secondary care have been revised.</li><li>The management sections for rotator cuff disorders, frozen shoulder, instability disorder, acromioclavicular joint disorders and glenohumeral osteoarthritis have been revised. </li><li>For the management of rotator cuff disorder, the following was added:<ul><li>Do not give more than two corticosteroid injections [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Kulkarni, R, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Royal College of Surgeons, 2014</a>]. Normally only one injection should be given (due to the risk of tendon damage from repeated injections). A second injection may be given after 6 weeks, but only to people who have seen improvement following the first injection, and who need the pain relief to allow them to undergo physiotherapy.</li></ul></li><li>For the management of frozen shoulder,  the recommendation to refer to physiotherapy if a person can tolerate movement of the affected shoulder was removed. Many physiotherapists perform steroid injections, which can be performed in the pain predominant phase [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, 2016</a>].  </li><li>For the management of rotator cuff disorders, the recommendation not to give a corticosteroid injection if a rotator cuff tear is suspected was removed. Steroid injections are a management option for degenerative rotator cuff tears [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2016a</a>]. Suspected traumatic rotator cuff tears should be referred urgently to orthopaedics [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Kulkarni, R, 2015</a>].</li></ul><!-- end field 092ac526-2d5b-4ad1-950a-9aa2191014bd --><!-- end item 45becec7-eaf9-481c-9ee5-58796567d5be -->","topic":{"id":"4cb42958-fcea-5d00-9a59-5f37fc8567a9","topicId":"f3174e5a-bae2-4f7a-9c7d-0eb5d9d2f431","topicName":"Shoulder pain","slug":"shoulder-pain","lastRevised":"Last revised in April 2017","chapters":[{"id":"7e98ae18-eb05-51d8-bd06-99e6f9ea7592","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"c2ee61d5-9b9f-55a8-961e-a54fdabbdfb8","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"92da69f0-be63-56ba-a5dc-5bc9e7215722","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"90a54bd7-a435-5262-aecd-c14a9b931f07","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"8caf6cc2-7a2b-5d0f-8faa-3a05ce905a2a","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"07edcf44-9881-5fa1-940f-b41d37a7a29a","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"9b8af079-86fb-53bc-a651-8e9d13e38545","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"64bb1ad4-db32-5278-8ee2-038d167c346b","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"b26af118-7d84-57bf-ad29-da4ddde04792","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"e0a44cb4-9685-50b7-9d1d-8e0f7d7eb9a4","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"909605ea-39f8-5140-840f-e48a9bfe81e5","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP - Options for local implementation"},{"id":"b2bc4fe0-a01e-5450-8673-251a4bb51775","slug":"nice-quality-standards","fullItemName":"NICE quality standards"}]},{"id":"d31ec9fd-2ac4-5a57-acd1-2a1bdb14963d","fullItemName":"Background information","slug":"background-information","subChapters":[{"id":"fdd420c6-4057-53a4-9591-dcfd32db6c67","slug":"causes","fullItemName":"Causes"}]},{"id":"02aea587-c091-5a12-bf15-dc008eb9288d","fullItemName":"Diagnosis","slug":"diagnosis","subChapters":[{"id":"bee0d8b0-dfd2-579b-bd21-f325dd15d52c","slug":"diagnosis","fullItemName":"Diagnosis"}]},{"id":"7958ee09-12b9-56be-85ad-12eefa9f3b3e","fullItemName":"Management","slug":"management","subChapters":[{"id":"b40abe3f-8dc0-5c6e-8d81-81f81b792ba3","slug":"initial-management","fullItemName":"Scenario: Initial management"},{"id":"7739e2da-6e22-5b95-abe7-00ca46c97e2a","slug":"frozen-shoulder","fullItemName":"Scenario: Frozen shoulder"},{"id":"88078af1-173f-5220-b0c3-6da60ed0cf18","slug":"rotator-cuff-disorders","fullItemName":"Scenario: Rotator cuff disorders"},{"id":"aca76c90-e7a0-537a-b46f-fbd5d920e0fa","slug":"instability-disorders","fullItemName":"Scenario: Instability disorders"},{"id":"fe5c1cf9-4ad6-5c9c-ba40-42eb29c477ce","slug":"acromioclavicular-joint-disorders","fullItemName":"Scenario: Acromioclavicular joint disorders"},{"id":"8f9c3b31-c5c6-50f1-901e-ecda6f15f081","slug":"glenohumeral-joint-osteoarthritis","fullItemName":"Scenario: Glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis"}]},{"id":"6b4311fd-c31c-5202-9353-7f69bbb0fdd3","fullItemName":"Supporting evidence","slug":"supporting-evidence","subChapters":[]},{"id":"2dd80c16-7c8b-5082-ae92-7d14723f6f76","fullItemName":"How this topic was developed","slug":"how-this-topic-was-developed","subChapters":[{"id":"cafa5c39-297f-584d-80e9-0cf8b866c069","slug":"search-strategy","fullItemName":"Search strategy"},{"id":"23b10c97-0bc0-5cc7-ac93-b2fee014cfa5","slug":"stakeholder-engagement","fullItemName":"Stakeholder engagement"},{"id":"2c4aebd1-7cf0-5e48-a220-a29bcf4a4f16","slug":"evidence-exclusion-criteria","fullItemName":"Evidence exclusion criteria"},{"id":"93115b14-e0e9-5d53-bdfe-32a967136d45","slug":"organizational-behavioural-financial-barriers","fullItemName":"Organizational, behavioural and financial barriers"},{"id":"611427f6-9e87-53f5-9942-8941e8a0ce59","slug":"declarations-of-interest","fullItemName":"Declarations of interest"}]},{"id":"e7b07c40-f5b8-5609-94fa-001eef61e88e","fullItemName":"References","slug":"references","subChapters":[]}]},"parentChapter":{"id":"92da69f0-be63-56ba-a5dc-5bc9e7215722","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?"},"subChapters":[{"id":"618fe9a1-6a04-5a41-bdd7-bdd24675c0c2","slug":"previous-changes","fullItemName":"Previous changes","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 3408ce1a-655f-4093-b19a-82a6c871d859 --><h3>Previous changes</h3><!-- end field 3408ce1a-655f-4093-b19a-82a6c871d859 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 9082c2b3-f0ce-488b-b4ce-31314568bab1 --><!-- begin field 717e4bb8-1f57-4112-97c3-df9affbd9451 --><p><strong>April 2015 </strong>— minor update.
