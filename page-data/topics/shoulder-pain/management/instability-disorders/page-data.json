It advises:  <ul><li>The person should be referred immediately to an Emergency department for clinical assessment, radiological investigations and reduction. X-rays (two views) are required to confirm the diagnosis of dislocation, the direction of this and to check for greater tuberosity fracture. Thorough neurological and circulatory examinations should be performed before and after the shoulder is relocated. Adequate analgesia (with or without sedation) should be given. Relocation should only be performed by a clinician with adequate expertise. X-rays should be taken to check the shoulder has been correctly relocated, and whether any greater tuberosity fracture is in a satisfactory position.  </li><li>Further investigations (such as ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging with arthrography, MRA) may be performed, depending on the age of the person; how likely it is they will need surgery; the number of previous dislocations and whether there are signs of associated injuries.</li><li>People aged over 40 should have further imaging (such as ultrasound or MRA) to check rotator cuff integrity. This age group has an increased risk of rotator cuff tears, and early surgical repair may be required. </li></ul></li><li>The recommendations regarding the management of a person following reduction of a shoulder dislocation are based on a BESS/BOA guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Brownson, P, 2015</a>].<ul><li>Follow up should usually be through the fracture clinic in secondary care. </li><li>Immobilisation for more than a week does not reduce the likelihood of having another dislocation. The person should mobilise the shoulder as soon as the pain allows. Early referral to physiotherapy may help with this. Physiotherapy aims to maintain the relocated shoulder joint so that the structures can heal properly and the joint and surrounding muscles can provide stability to the shoulder [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Thangarajah, 2015</a>]. </li><li>The decision to perform surgery following first time dislocation is based on the risk of further dislocations (for example age and sex); the likelihood of complications such as post-traumatic osteoarthritis; occupation and sporting activities. </li><li>If a rotator cuff tear is suspected following dislocation, the person should be referred urgently to a shoulder surgeon. Expert opinion in a systematic review advises rotator cuff tear should be suspected in people who have persistent pain and weakness 2-3 weeks after dislocation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Gombera, M.M., 2014</a>]. </li></ul></li><li>The BESS/BOA guideline proposes that following uncomplicated primary anterior dislocation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Brownson, P, 2015</a>]:<ul><li>People aged under 25 should be seen by a shoulder specialist before 6 weeks, and further imaging and arthroscopic anatomic repair considered. Young men have an especially high risk of recurrent dislocation. The evidence suggests arthroscopic repair is beneficial, especially if the person plays contact sports or has an occupation that involves overhead activities.  </li><li>People aged 25-40 should be reviewed at 3-6 months.  If there are symptoms, further imaging and repair should be considered. </li></ul></li></ul><h5>Referral</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to refer people with recurrent traumatic instability to orthopaedics is based on a BESS/BOA guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Brownson, P, 2015</a>]. It recommends that in most cases, surgery will be needed. It also recommends referral to a shoulder surgeon if physiotherapy is not successful following dislocation. A New Zealand guideline also recommends people with recurrent dislocation should be referred to an orthopaedic specialist to evaluate the need for surgical stabilisation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">NZGG, 2004</a>]. </li><li>The recommendations to refer people with symptoms that are impacting on their job or leisure activities and people with shoulder dislocation and seizures to a shoulder surgeon is based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Thangarajah, 2015</a>]. Dislocation and instability can occur following a seizure. Management can be difficult because the shoulder structures can be damaged after the person has had a surgical repair. The person should be managed by a multidisciplinary team, which should also include a neurologist and physiotherapist. </li><li>The recommendation to refer people with suspected muscle patterning instability to physiotherapy is based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Thangarajah, 2015</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to refer people with suspected atraumatic instability to physiotherapy, and to orthopaedics if this is not beneficial, is based on the <em>Oxford University hospitals guidelines for the diagnosis of common shoulder problems in primary care</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Oxford Shoulder Clinic, 2010</a>]. </li></ul><!-- end field be065618-b3f1-4ad6-9ac1-d5a5ba3bb9c4 --><!-- end item c0281377-577f-4d95-b027-846cdd107982 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
