Regular dosing is more effective than 'as required use'. For further information see the CKS topic <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/analgesia-mild-to-moderate-pain/\">Analgesia - mild-to-moderate pain</a>. </li><li>If paracetamol is ineffective, consider an oral NSAID (for example, ibuprofen) or codeine.

A small proportion of people with frozen shoulder are referred to orthopaedics. Management options in secondary care include manipulation of the shoulder joint under general anaesthetic and capsular release [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, 2016</a>]. </li><li>The management options are based on the BESS/BOA guideline for the management of frozen shoulder [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, A., 2015</a>].</li><li>There is a lack of evidence for the efficacy of conservative and surgical treatments for frozen shoulder [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, A., 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, 2016</a>]. A step-up approach in terms of treatment invasiveness should be considered. Management should depend on the degree of symptoms and functional impairment, and involve shared-decision making [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2016b</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, 2016</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Analgesia</h5><ul><li>BESS/BOA recommend analgesia for the pain of frozen shoulder.<ul><li>Pain relief is particularly important in the initial painful stage [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Dias et al, 2005</a>] and may be useful in helping compliance with physical therapy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Moskowitz and Blaine, 2005</a>].</li><li>NSAIDs have been shown to reduce pain in people with acute capsulitis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, A., 2015</a>]. Expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2016b</a>] states that prescribing NSAIDs early in the disease course may also reduce the disease severity.The effectiveness of paracetamol and codeine is not known [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, A., 2015</a>]. However, CKS advises that the choice of analgesia should be based on clinical judgement, taking into account the severity of the person's symptoms and comorbidities. <ul><li>For more information on the adverse effect profile and contraindications to prescribing NSAIDs, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/nsaids-prescribing-issues/\">NSAIDs - prescribing issues</a>.</li></ul></li><li>CKS has not recommended the use of stronger opioids in primary care as long-term treatment should be undertaken with caution because of the potential for dependence [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Iannotti and Kwon, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Moskowitz and Blaine, 2005</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Physiotherapy</h5><ul><li>Physiotherapy has been shown to have some benefit in the management of frozen shoulder [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, 2016</a>]. This benefit is seen in the short-to-medium term [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, A., 2015</a>]. </li><li>The recommendation to start physiotherapy as early as possible is based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2016b</a>].</li><li>The length of physiotherapy treatment is as recommended by BESS/BOA.</li><li>It is unclear which mode of physiotherapy is best for people with frozen shoulder as there is insufficient evidence [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, A., 2015</a>]. For people who have already had an intra-articular corticosteroid injection or physiotherapy, short-wave diathermy plus stretching and high grade mobilization techniques may be beneficial. </li><li>Physiotherapists provide advice and education, which people with frozen shoulder find very important. A qualitative study of patients perceptions and priorities when living with primary frozen shoulder [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Jones, 2013</a>]. </li><li>A supervised exercise programme has been found to give a faster improvement in range of movement than a simple home programme of gentle exercise [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">NZGG, 2004</a>].</li><li>CKS recommends ensuring adequate analgesia is provided so that the person is able to tolerate the movements involved. </li></ul><h5>Intra-articular corticosteroid injection</h5><ul><li>Intra-articular steroid injection has been shown to have some benefit in the management of frozen shoulder [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, A., 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, 2016</a>]. A single injection has been shown to have a short term improvement in pain, function and range of movement compared with placebo [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Maund, 2012</a>], and possibly compared with manual therapy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Page, 2014</a>], in people who have had frozen shoulder for up to one year [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, 2016</a>]. Physiotherapy following steroid injection may be more effective than physiotherapy on its own [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, 2016</a>]. </li><li>The BESS/BOA guideline recommends intra-articular corticosteroid injection as a treatment option for frozen shoulder [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, A., 2015</a>]. This advises that clinicians follow a step-up approach in terms of treatment invasiveness, and also take into account the severity of symptoms and impact these are having on the person. Expert opinion in a review article recommends considering a steroid injection for people who still have pain despite starting physiotherapy and a trial of NSAIDS (if there are no contraindications) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2016b</a>]. It also recommends that a steroid injection could be offered before starting physiotherapy so as to allow early intensive physiotherapy. Expert opinion in another review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, 2016</a>] suggests that physiotherapy in the pain-predominant phase is likely to include an intra-articular steroid injection, and a New Zealand guideline also recommends considering an intra-articular steroid injection in the painful phase of frozen shoulder[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">NZGG, 2004</a>].</li><li>Current evidence does not allow definite conclusions to be made as to the clinical situations for which steroid injection (with or without physiotherapy) is most likely to be an effective treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, A., 2015</a>]. The BESS/BOA guideline advises to refer to orthopaedics if primary care management is ineffective[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, A., 2015</a>]. It does not comment on whether or not injection should be repeated if it has been beneficial. There is some evidence that repeated injections can cause tendon damage [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Dean, 2014</a>].</li><li>Corticosteroid injection is not recommended in the stiffness predominant phase, as the inflammatory stage is over [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Dias et al, 2005</a>]. </li><li>Intra-articular steroid injection may be technically difficult [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">NZGG, 2004</a>], therefore should only be performed in primary care if the expertise is available. </li><li><strong>Choice of corticosteroid and use of lidocaine:</strong><ul><li>CKS found no guidelines informing the choice of corticosteroid. A number of corticosteroid preparations are listed in the British National Formulary [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">BNF 73, 2017</a>], but feedback from expert reviewers suggested that triamcinolone or methylprednisolone are the most commonly used. Expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2016b</a>] suggests using triamcinolone acetonide.</li><li>Feedback from expert reviewers also suggested that local anaesthetic is commonly used in conjunction with a corticosteroid. Reasons given for this included that local anaesthetic can give immediate pain relief, can help confirm the diagnosis, and may decrease the risk of steroid atrophy by diluting the corticosteroid. Expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2016b</a>] suggests using triamcinolone acetonide administered with a local anaesthetic.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Adverse effects: </strong>CKS advises discussion of adverse effects when considering corticosteroid injections. These include infection (rare if sterile technique used), tendon rupture, 'post-injection flare of pain' and hyperglycaemia in people with diabetes [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">NZGG, 2004</a>]  [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">DTB, 1995</a>]. Advice for the person to rest for 24 hours following the injection, and seek medical advice if there is severe pain, especially if associated with fever, is recommended by the Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin review. </li><li>A New Zealand guideline advises monitoring blood glucose in people with diabetes after corticosteroid injection as this may be elevated for 24–48 hours [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">NZGG, 2004</a>].</li><li>Feedback from expert reviewers suggests that it may be preferable to defer steroid injections until diabetes is well controlled and that the risk of infection should be carefully considered in a person with diabetes. </li></ul><h5>Referral</h5><ul><li>The recommendations for when to refer someone with frozen shoulder to orthopaedics are based on the BESS/BOA guideline for the diagnosis and management of frozen shoulder [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, A., 2015</a>].</li></ul><h5>Treatments not recommended</h5><ul><li>Oral corticosteroids are not recommended by BESS/BOA for the management of frozen shoulder in primary care [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, A., 2015</a>]. There is evidence they may reduce pain early in the disease, but only in the short term [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2016b</a>]. Intra-articular steroid injection has been shown to be more effective. Therefore this CKS guideline does not recommend the prescription of oral corticosteroids for frozen shoulder. </li></ul><!-- end field a22fe57e-9663-4268-97da-ecd036bbf457 --><!-- end item 3dfec664-3213-4447-afac-bcbf0dbf47b3 -->","subChapters":[]}]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
