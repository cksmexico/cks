The update on assessment, treatment and referral of the painful shoulder advises the importance of pain control in allowing the person to return to normal activities as early as possible [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Artus, 2014</a>]. Restarting normal activities and returning to work early in the course of shoulder pain help reduce the chance of restricted function in the long-term. There is evidence that physiotherapy and home exercises provide some improvement for people with shoulder pain in the short term [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Buchbinder et al, 2003</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Green et al, 2003</a>]. The optimum timing of referral for physiotherapy is not clear [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Artus, 2014</a>]. There is no definite evidence on how soon people with shoulder pain should be reviewed. The recommendations for timing of review are based on suggestions from this review article. </li></ul><h5>Intermediate care</h5><ul><li>This aims to reduce referrals to hospital while ensuring that people are directed towards the most appropriate services and clinicians working at the interface between primary and secondary care.
