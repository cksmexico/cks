Evidence for the efficacy of conservative and surgical treatments is limited. Therefore the BESS/BOA guideline recommends shared decision-making in the person's management, and that the clinician considers the severity of symptoms and the impact that these are having on the person [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Kulkarni, R, 2015</a>]. Management options for subacromial shoulder pain are based on this guideline and a Royal College of Surgeons commissioning guide [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Royal College of Surgeons, 2014</a>]. Shared decision making and goal setting are also recommended by an Australian guideline for the management of rotator cuff syndrome in the workplace [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">University of New South Wales, 2013</a>].</li><li>Non-surgical treatments for rotator cuff disorders are often used together, rather than alone [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">University of New South Wales, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Diercks, R., 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Kulkarni, R, 2015</a>].</li></ul><h5>Rest</h5><ul><li>A Dutch guideline recommends rest in the acute phase, and then to gradually increase activity [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Diercks, R., 2014</a>]. An Australian guideline for the management of rotator cuff syndrome in the workplace advises workers should restart their usual activities as soon as possible, within the limits of pain. This is important for avoiding future disability and improving function [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">University of New South Wales, 2013</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Advice</h5><ul><li>New Zealand, Dutch and UK guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">NZGG, 2004</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Diercks, R., 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Kulkarni, R, 2015</a>] and articles on the management of shoulder pain in primary care [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Hazleman, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Mitchell, 2008</a>] recommend self-help advice and a discussion of physical contributory factors and analgesia. </li><li>A Dutch guideline recommends activity modifications for occupations that involve repetitive movements of the arm, prolonged use of the arms and hand held vibration tools [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Diercks, R., 2014</a>]. Reduction of precipitating movements (e.g. overhead activities) is advised, as this helps the person to avoid the painful arc between 60 and 120 degrees [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Burbank et al, 2008</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Analgesia</h5><ul><li>Oral NSAIDs may reduce pain in the short term for people with acute tendonitis or subacromial bursitis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Kulkarni, R, 2015</a>]. A Dutch guideline recommends using NSAIDs only if necessary during the acute phase, and for a maximum of 2 weeks [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Diercks, R., 2014</a>]. A New Zealand guideline recommends caution with NSAIDS in view of side effects, and recommends that paracetamol may give adequate pain relief [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">NZGG, 2004</a>]. A systematic review found there was low to moderate grade evidence that NSAIDS reduced pain in people with rotator cuff tendinopathy, and moderate evidence that NSAIDS were as effective as a steroid injection for pain in the short term [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Boudreault, J., 2014</a>]. It also found that there is insufficient evidence regarding the use of NSAIDS in the moderate to long term.  </li><li>It is not known whether topical NSAIDS, paracetamol or opioids  are beneficial for shoulder pain [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Kulkarni, R, 2015</a>]. As the evidence for the efficacy of conservative treatments for subacromial shoulder pain as a result of rotator cuff disorders, and the benefits of one over another, is limited, CKS advises that the choice of analgesia should be based on clinical judgement, taking into account the severity of the person's symptoms and comorbidities. </li><li>For more information on the adverse effect profile and contraindications to prescribing NSAIDs, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/nsaids-prescribing-issues/\">NSAIDs - prescribing issues</a>.</li><li>CKS has not recommended the use of stronger opioids in primary care as long-term treatment should be undertaken with caution because of the potential for dependence [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Iannotti and Kwon, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Moskowitz and Blaine, 2005</a>].</li></ul><h5>Physiotherapy/exercise</h5><ul><li>Australian, Dutch and UK guidelines recommend physiotherapy for subacromial shoulder pain [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">University of New South Wales, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Diercks, R., 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Kulkarni, R, 2015</a>]. Evidence suggests physiotherapy may be beneficial for pain and improving function in people with mixed shoulder disorders. The types of treatment are as recommended by a UK guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Royal College of Surgeons, 2014</a>]. The level and intensity of exercises are as recommended by a Dutch guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Diercks, R., 2014</a>].</li><li>A recent Cochrane review of manual therapy and exercise for rotator cuff disease found that only one of the 60 relevant trials included manual therapy and exercise which was consistent with current practice [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Page, 2016</a>]. This showed manual therapy and exercise improved function slightly more than placebo did at 22 weeks, and that there was little difference in pain. There is also some low quality evidence that there was little difference in outcome when manual therapy and exercise were compared with corticosteroid injection. </li></ul><h5>Corticosteroid injections</h5><ul><li>UK guidelines recommend that subacromial corticosteroid injection can be used in the management of subacromial shoulder pain [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Royal College of Surgeons, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Kulkarni, R, 2015</a>]. They report that due to limited evidence, it is not known whether this is effective. The guidelines state corticosteroid injections can be considered along with rest, exercise, physiotherapy and analgesia in the person's management, and that management should involve shared decision-making. A Dutch guideline recommends a corticosteroid injection can be used in the first 8 weeks for severe pain, along with other conservative management options, such as physiotherapy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Diercks, R., 2014</a>]. An Australian guideline advises subacromial corticosteroid injection for injured workers with persistent pain or make little progress, following the start of an active non-surgical treatment programme [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">University of New South Wales, 2013</a>]. A recent meta-analysis found corticosteroid injection was no more effective than placebo injection at reducing pain at the 3 month follow up, and gave transient pain relief in a small number of people with rotator cuff tendinosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Mohamadi A., 2016</a>]. </li><li>An article on the management of shoulder pain in primary care suggests that steroid injections should always be used in conjunction with analgesia and mobilizing physiotherapy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Hazleman, 2005</a>]. </li><li>A review suggests if a person has seen little improvement following initial activity modification, analgesia and physiotherapy, or if the person has significantly reduced function due to pain at the start, a corticosteroid injection may provide pain relief to allow a greater range of shoulder movement and tolerance of physiotherapy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Burbank et al, 2008</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Choice of corticosteroid and use of lidocaine</h5><ul><li>CKS found no guidelines informing the choice of corticosteroid. A number of corticosteroid preparations are listed in the British National Formulary [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">BNF 73, 2017</a>], but feedback from expert reviewers suggested that triamcinolone or methylprednisolone are the most commonly used. </li><li>Feedback from expert reviewers also suggested that local anaesthetic is commonly used in conjunction with a corticosteroid. Reasons given for this included that local anaesthetic can give immediate pain relief, can help confirm the diagnosis, and may decrease the risk of steroid atrophy by diluting the corticosteroid. An Australian guideline also advises the use of local anaesthetic for pain relief and to confirm that the needle had been placed accurately [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">University of New South Wales, 2013</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Number of injections</h5><ul><li>The BESS/BOA and Royal College of Surgeons guidelines advise not to give more than two corticosteroid injections, and that normally only one injection should be given [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Royal College of Surgeons, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Kulkarni, R, 2015</a>].  Evidence suggests that repeated frequent injections could cause damage to tendons [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Dean, 2014</a>].</li></ul><h5>Adverse effects</h5><ul><li>CKS advises discussion of adverse effects when considering subacromial corticosteroid injections. These include infection (rare if sterile technique used), tendon rupture, infections, 'post-injection flare of pain', skin atrophy and hyperglycaemia in people with diabetes [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">DTB, 1995</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">NZGG, 2004</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">University of New South Wales, 2013</a>]. Feedback from an expert reviewer suggests other adverse effects including local tissue atrophy, flushing, and menstrual disorders in women. </li><li>A New Zealand guideline advises monitoring blood glucose in people with diabetes after corticosteroid injection, as this may be elevated for 24–48 hours [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">NZGG, 2004</a>].</li><li>Feedback from expert reviewers suggests that it may be preferable to defer steroid injections until diabetes is well controlled, and that the risk of infection should be carefully considered in a person with diabetes. </li><li>Advice for the person to rest for 24 hours following the injection, and seek medical advice if there is severe pain, especially if associated with fever, is recommended by a Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin review [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">DTB, 1995</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Intermediate care</h5><ul><li>This aims to reduce referrals to hospital while ensuring that people are directed towards the most appropriate services and clinicians working at the interface between primary and secondary care. They provide rapid assessment, diagnosis and treatment of people with a variety of musculoskeletal problems.
