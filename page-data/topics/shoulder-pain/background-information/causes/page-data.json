The person may give a history of the shoulder feeling that it moves partly or completely 'out of joint' and may be concerned their shoulder may dislocate during certain activities or sports. There may be other non-specific symptoms such as shoulder ache or intermittent clicking. If the instability is longstanding, there may be hand or arm weakness, tingling or numbness from proximal nerve traction [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Brun, 2012a</a>]. Few tests of shoulder instability have been shown to be useful in practice [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Thangarajah, 2015</a>].

There is another peak in women aged over 80. Typically the person presents with significant pain following a fall onto an outstretched hand.

These injuries are more commonly seen in older people [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Paxton, 2014</a>].</li><li>Posterior shoulder dislocation makes up 2-4% of all shoulder dislocations. The diagnosis is often missed at first presentation. This may be because the health care professional or person do not feel the injury was sufficient to dislocate the shoulder; or because examination findings are more subtle than seen in anterior dislocation; or because only one X-ray view of the shoulder has been performed. Early diagnosis is important as there is often an associated fracture of the humeral head, which if undetected, can lead to osteoarthritis or avascular necrosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Jacobs, 2015</a>]. Posterior dislocation can be caused by indirect trauma, with the arm flexed at the shoulder in adduction and internal rotation.
