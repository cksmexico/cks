Assess flexion, extension, abduction, adduction and internal and external rotation.</li><li>Look for the painful arc of abduction, if this is possible within the limits of discomfort (pain between 70–120 degrees of active abduction), and if present, check if there is pain on abduction with the thumb down, worse against resistance. </li><li>Perform the cross-arm test.

X-rays are not routinely needed, unless to exclude arthritis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">NZGG, 2004</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, 2016</a>]. The BESS/BOA guideline recommends performing X-rays to confirm the diagnosis of glenohumeral osteoarthritis, and exclude other diagnoses such as avascular necrosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Rangan, A., 2015</a>]. </li><li>The BESS/BOA guideline for the management of subacromial shoulder pain advises considering X-rays if the person is not improving with conservative treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Kulkarni, R, 2015</a>]. </li><li>The BESS/BOA guideline recommends that diagnostic ultrasound is performed in secondary care, rather than in primary care [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Kulkarni, R, 2015</a>]. A normal ultrasound of the rotator cuff does not exclude serious causes of shoulder pain, such as malignancy. The accuracy of ultrasound in diagnosis is dependent on the clinician performing the examination. Partial tears are a common report finding, however, these can be asymptomatic or a false positive examination finding. Therefore if a tear is found on ultrasound, it does not always correlate with the person's symptoms or mean surgery will definitely be needed. The BESS/BOA guideline recommends ultrasound findings should be interpreted by orthopaedic surgeons and considered along with the person's symptoms and previous management. A review also recommends that ultrasound and MRI are generally secondary care investigations [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/shoulder-pain/references/\">Artus, 2014</a>]. </li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 2293a313-ecb0-4093-9858-a74c00b60237 --><!-- end item a5986de5-dda2-43a4-b78c-a74c00b60100 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
