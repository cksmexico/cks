This approach is supported by the BSPGHAN publication, the ESsCD publication, and US best practice guidelines.</li><li>The NICE guideline notes, however, the low sensitivity and specificity of serology testing as markers of dietary adherence and histological recovery, as coeliac serology is not an accurate biomarker for response to a gluten-free diet. It concludes that serology testing alone should not be used to determine adherence to a gluten-free diet. Similarly, the BSG guidelines state there is some evidence that low coeliac antibody titres do not accurately predict mucosal recovery, and serum antibodies have poor sensitivity for persistent villous atrophy, especially 1 year or more after diagnosis and starting a gluten-free diet.</li><li>The ESsCD publication notes that a weakly positive antibody titre may become negative within weeks of strict adherence to a gluten-free diet, and after 6–12 months of a strict diet, 80% of people will have negative serology. By 5 years, more than 90% will have negative serology, however, negative serology at follow up does not predict recovery of villous atrophy. It suggests that persistently positive serology 1 year after starting a gluten-free diet indicates ongoing gluten ingestion.</li><li>The NASPGHAN publication states that eventual normalization of antibody titres on repeat serological testing 1–2 years following the start of a gluten-free diet is widely used as an indicator of dietary adherence and mucosal recovery in children. Expert opinion in a review article also notes that coeliac serology usually normalizes within 6–12 months, and although it correlates poorly with mucosal recovery, it can be used as a proxy measure of dietary adherence [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/coeliac-disease/references/\">Thomas, 2018</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to assess for iron deficiency and/or anaemia is extrapolated from the ESsCD publication.</li><li>The information on the possible significance of thrombocytosis is based on expert opinion in a review article [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/coeliac-disease/references/\">Caio, 2019</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to screen for autoimmune thyroid and liver disease is extrapolated from the BSPGHAN publication, the ESsCD publication, the NASPGHAN publication, and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/coeliac-disease/references/\">Thomas, 2018</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/coeliac-disease/references/\">Caio, 2019</a>].</li><li>The recommendation to assess for other micronutrient deficiencies is based on the ESsCD publication, which notes that a gluten-free diet is typically low in folate, and folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation may be needed, particularly for slow responders. In addition, vitamin D absorption may be decreased due to fat malabsorption.

It recognized the lack of strong evidence to support this and limited access to specialist dietitians in primary care, therefore, it advised to consider dietitian referral if there was difficulty adhering to or assessing adherence to a gluten-free diet at review.</li><li>The BSG guidelines also note the key importance of dietetic input and regular follow up to ensure adherence to a gluten-free diet.</li><li>This approach is supported by the ESsCD publication, which recommends referral for suspected dietary non-adherence.</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article notes that evaluation by a dietitian may be a highly effective method to assess dietary adherence, as this does not correlate well with patients’ self-reported adherence or coeliac serology results [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/coeliac-disease/references/\">Cichewicz, 2019</a>].</li></ul></li><li>The recommendation to refer if there are symptoms of non-responsive disease is based on the NICE clinical guideline, which notes the most common cause of persisting symptoms is gluten ingestion [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/coeliac-disease/references/\">NICE, 2015b</a>].

Follow-up duodenal biopsy may be needed to rule out refractory disease or malignancy, and additional specialist investigations may be arranged, such as small bowel imaging, faecal fat analysis, and pancreas imaging to exclude alternative or additional diagnoses.</li><li>The AGA clinical practice update recommends that people with persistent or relapsing symptoms, without other obvious explanations, should undergo endoscopic biopsies to determine healing even if there is negative coeliac serology.</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article recommends gastroenterology referral if there is weight loss, severe micronutrient deficiency, or other symptoms suggestive of malabsorption, despite a gluten-free diet.
