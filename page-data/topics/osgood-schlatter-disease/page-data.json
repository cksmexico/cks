Symptoms persist into adulthood in approximately 10% of people and may lead to chronic pain, reduced ability to participate in sports, and decreased lower body strength.</li></ul></li><li>On examination there may be tenderness over the tibial tuberosity that is provoked by knee extension against resistance, and swelling or bony enlargement of the tibial tuberosity.</li><li>A diagnosis of Osgood-Schlatter disease can be made on the basis of clinical features alone if there are no features of other causes of knee pain. An alternative diagnosis should be suspected if knee pain:<ul><li>Starts suddenly after trauma to the knee.</li><li>Is associated with systemic symptoms, including fever or general malaise.</li><li>Is associated with bone pain or joint pain at other sites.</li><li>Persists at night or after rest.</li><li>Is associated with an abnormal examination of the hip or knee joint.</li></ul></li><li>Routine knee X-ray is not recommended to confirm the diagnosis.</li><li>Management strategies include:<ul><li>Offering analgesia such as paracetamol and/or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), use of protective knee pads to relieve pain on kneeling, and the intermittent application of ice packs over the tibial tuberosity.</li><li>Giving advice about exercise modification and muscle stretching exercises.</li></ul></li><li>For people whose knee pain does not improve or worsens despite appropriate management:<ul><li>The cause of knee pain should be reassessed and where there is diagnostic uncertainty, referral to a paediatrician or orthopaedic surgeon should be made.</li><li>Referral to a physiotherapist should be considered.</li><li>People whose symptoms persist into adulthood should be referred for specialist assessment to an orthopaedic surgeon if symptoms are significantly affecting their functioning.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 9d805d45-93cd-45d8-8926-c6079e4614e8 --><!-- end item 0005ac27-95f9-4810-afaf-b89abd7f4baf -->","topic":{"id":"1092b5e1-870c-5149-b881-c3c8fb461728","topicId":"c436fe4c-7c41-495b-9029-55813b90df30","topicName":"Osgood-Schlatter disease","slug":"osgood-schlatter-disease","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"244a41fb-ca99-5243-8b58-798e66fa459b","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"bf8c0094-6043-5c2f-983d-22d23d51d78b","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"f58e854c-fca2-5714-8338-964b2aa45e68","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"b1f3e68e-9050-51e9-b723-70c31f105ac0","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"801a043c-65f8-5820-a837-2d2c39e05a2c","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"6179d425-452d-5d4d-a57c-11e6229f6e4e","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"33f2b244-2fb6-5a57-b78a-bf983734b225","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"08291bef-ffd0-531a-8552-c296c943ea69","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"8611fc75-b1cb-5194-9eab-5b1ca58de742","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"35c4d173-e474-57c9-9a16-17ba8dfd0702","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"cf625b33-b7cc-5f02-aa2d-626609674f49","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
