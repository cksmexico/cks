The most common pregnancy-related causes of itch are:<ul><li>Obstetric cholestasis (also known as 'intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy') — which does not present with a rash.</li><li>Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy, atopic eruption of pregnancy, and pemphigoid gestationis — all of which present with a rash.</li></ul></li><li>Itch occurs in about one in five pregnant women.</li><li>Obstetric cholestasis is the main cause of itch without a rash in pregnancy.<ul><li>The itch (often severe) usually starts abruptly in the third trimester, is often more noticeable on the soles and palms but can occur anywhere on the body, and may be worse at night.</li><li>Obstetric cholestasis generally poses no risk to the pregnant woman. Although it is associated with an increased risk of stillbirth, for most women this appears to be only slightly raised above background rates with specialist management. Symptoms in the woman usually resolve spontaneously after delivery.</li><li>Any woman with suspected obstetric cholestasis should be referred to obstetrics for same-day investigation.</li></ul></li><li>Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy usually occurs in the third trimester. It usually only affects the first pregnancy, and is more likely in women with a multiple pregnancy.<ul><li>The rash is intensely itchy, and consists of pruritic urticarial papules that coalesce into plaques. Typically, it starts on the abdomen, but the umbilicus is usually spared. It may later develop into widespread non-urticated erythema, with eczematous lesions and vesicles.</li><li>It poses no serious risk to the woman or baby; symptoms last 4–6 weeks on average, and usually resolve immediately following delivery.</li><li>Symptomatic treatment includes emollients, moderately potent topical corticosteroids, and sedating antihistamines.</li></ul></li><li>Atopic eruption of pregnancy commonly presents in the first trimester. It is more likely in women with a personal or family history of atopic eczema.<ul><li>The rash is itchy and consists of eczematous, papular lesions.</li><li>Although it poses no serious risk to the woman, the child may be at increased risk of developing atopic eczema.</li><li>Symptomatic treatment includes emollients, moderately potent topical corticosteroids, and sedating antihistamines.</li></ul></li><li>Pemphigoid gestationis is very rare.<ul><li>An intense itch often precedes the rash, which initially presents with erythematous urticarial papules and plaques on the abdomen (and nearly always the umbilicus), but may spread to cover the entire body and progress to form tense blisters.</li><li>The woman is likely to have exacerbations and remissions throughout pregnancy. It is associated with preterm birth and of the infant being small for gestational age. Pemphigoid gestationis spontaneously regresses after delivery. There is an approximately 10% chance of mild and transient skin lesions in the neonate.</li><li>Referral should be made to obstetrics for additional antenatal surveillance, and dermatology for treatment with topical or systemic corticosteroids.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 2c160378-b6da-412a-ac2a-b00061d8f25c --><!-- end item 66cd6785-9547-4549-9ac2-f29c354d1788
