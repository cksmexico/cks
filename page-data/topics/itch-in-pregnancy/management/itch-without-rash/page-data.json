Otherwise, unexplained abnormalities in transaminases, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and/or bile acids are considered sufficient to support the diagnosis.</li><li>Further tests may be required to exclude differential diagnoses that can cause abnormal LFT results, including pre-eclampsia and fatty liver of pregnancy, and illnesses not specific to pregnancy including hepatitis A, B, and C, Epstein-Barr and cytomegalovirus, and primary biliary cirrhosis.</li><li>Although cardiotocography is likely to be carried out in an initial assessment of fetal wellbeing, it does not predict future fetal wellbeing.</li><li>Ursodeoxycholic acid may be prescribed in secondary care as a treatment for obstetric cholestasis. The UK Teratology Information Service (UKTIS) states that there are no apparent adverse fetal or neonatal effects associated with its use in late pregnancy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-in-pregnancy/references/\">UKTIS, 2020b</a>].<ul><li>Note: since the publication of the 2011 RCOG guideline <em>Obstetric cholestasis</em>, the large multicentre randomised controlled PITCHES trial found that use of ursodeoxycholic acid to treat obstetric cholestasis (n=305 exposed versus n=300 placebo) did not improve maternal bile acid concentrations, itch, or perinatal outcomes [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-in-pregnancy/references/\">Chappell, 2019</a>]. Based on these newer data, specialist guidance from the charity ICP Support states that use of ursodeoxycholic acid should be considered carefully [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-in-pregnancy/references/\">ICP Support, 2020</a>].  Local prescribing protocols within obstetric practice may, therefore, have changed to accomodate this updated information.</li></ul></li><li>Sedating antihistamines may offer relief from itch at night via their sedative effects. The UKTIS states that the sedating antihistamines for which there is the most pregnancy safety data are chlorphenamine and promethazine [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-in-pregnancy/references/\">UKTIS, 2019a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-in-pregnancy/references/\">UKTIS, 2019b</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-in-pregnancy/references/\">UKTIS, 2020a</a>]. </li><li>Vitamin K supplementation reduces the risk of vitamin K deficiency (and associated maternal and fetal/neonatal haemorrhage) caused by reduced enterohepatic recirculation of bile acids and resultant malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins.</li><li>Elective early delivery from 37 weeks' gestation may be considered on a case-by-case basis, as at this stage of pregnancy the risks to the fetus/neonate of early delivery may be considered to be outweighed by the uncertain risk of stillbirth if the pregnancy continues.<ul><li>Research carried out in 2019 suggested that bile acid concentrations may be taken into account when the need for iatrogenic delivery is being considered. A meta-analysis that included 5557 pregnancies complicated by obstetric cholestasis found that:<ul><li>Women with serum bile acid concentrations of at least 100 micromol/L exhibited a statistically significant 30-fold increased risk of stillbirth compared with those with serum bile acid concentrations of less than 40 micromol/L.</li><li>Women with serum bile acid concentrations of 40–99 micromol/L exhibited a statistically non-significant 2.4-fold increased risk of stillbirth compared with those with serum bile acid concentrations of less than 40 micromol/L.</li><li>The authors stated that the majority of women with obstetric cholestasis have serum bile acid concentrations of less than 100 micromol/L and can probably be reassured that the risk of stillbirth is similar to that of pregnant women in the general population, provided repeat bile acid testing is carried out until delivery.</li><li>Expert advice provided by the charity ICP Support has suggested that bile acid concentrations could be considered when deciding the timing of iatrogenic delivery in women with obstetric cholestasis, but has also highlighted that there is no in-depth study of women who progress beyond 38 weeks gestation, and the effects of obstetric cholestasis on maternal wellbeing should also be considered [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-in-pregnancy/references/\">ICP Support, 2020</a>].</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h5>Follow up</h5><ul><li>Recommendations on follow up are largely based on the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guideline <em>Obstetric cholestasis </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-in-pregnancy/references/\">RCOG, 2011</a>]. It is normal for LFT results to increase for the first 10 days postnatally (a physiological response), so avoid testing during this time period.</li><li>Abnormal LFT results usually peak at about 8 weeks following an episode of obstetric cholestasis (although rarely they may be abnormal for longer).
