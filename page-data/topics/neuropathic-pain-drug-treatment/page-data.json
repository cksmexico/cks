In many cases, it is not possible to completely cure the underlying disease or lesion or to reverse the neurological changes. Consequently, neuropathic pain is usually persistent in these cases.</li><li>A person with neuropathic pain (except trigeminal neuralgia) should be offered a choice of amitriptyline, duloxetine, gabapentin, or pregabalin.<ul><li>The dosage should be titrated according to response and tolerability.</li><li>The person should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse before prescribing gabapentin or pregabalin and observed for development of signs of abuse and dependence.</li></ul></li><li>Capsaicin 0.075% cream may be considered for people with localized neuropathic pain who wish to avoid, or cannot tolerate, oral treatments.</li><li>When developing a treatment plan the person's concerns and expectations should be discussed, including: <ul><li>The severity of pain, and its impact on lifestyle, daily activities (including sleep disturbance), and participation.</li><li>The underlying cause of the pain and whether the condition has deteriorated.</li><li>Why a particular pharmacological treatment is being offered.</li><li>The benefits and possible adverse effects of pharmacological treatments, taking into account any physical or psychological problems, and concurrent medicines.</li><li>The importance of dosage titrations and the titration process, providing the person with individualized information and advice.</li><li>Coping strategies for pain and possible adverse effects of treatment.</li><li>Non-pharmacological treatments, for example, physical and psychological therapies (which may be offered through a rehabilitation service) and surgery (which may be offered through specialist services).</li></ul></li><li>An early clinical review should be arranged to assess the progress made with dose titration and the tolerability and effectiveness of the chosen treatment.</li><li>If the treatment is not effective or is not tolerated one of the other three remaining drug options should be offered (for example if on amitriptyline, switch to duloxetine, gabapentin, or pregabalin). If the treatment is still not effective or is not tolerated, switching to one of the other treatments should be considered until a suitable treatment is found, or all four drugs have been tried. <ul><li>Clinical judgement should be used to decide whether to titrate the dose more slowly upwards instead of switching (especially if adverse effects improve with time following each dose increase).</li><li>When withdrawing or switching treatment the withdrawal regimen should be tapered to take account of dosage and any discontinuation symptoms.</li></ul></li><li>Referral (to specialist pain services or a relevant clinical specialty) should be considered at any stage (including at initial presentation and at regular clinical reviews) if:<ul><li>Pain is severe.</li><li>Pain significantly limits participation in daily activities.</li><li>The underlying health condition that is causing neuropathic pain has deteriorated.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 9fa1e9d6-f0a3-4539-ac34-877d4f0ecf6e --><!-- end item 08a7d0f6-02a3-4246-956b-762d4cd722dd -->","topic":{"id":"b1f9c908-6cb6-5afd-a737-0a621c6232d0","topicId":"35e3d915-8243-4418-a7dd-6590d8ca5c85","topicName":"Neuropathic pain -
