The pharmacological management of neuropathic pain in adults in non-specialist settings </em>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">NICE, 2019a</a>]. </p><h5>Offering amitriptyline, duloxetine, gabapentin, or pregabalin</h5><ul><li>NICE found consistent evidence showing that compared with placebo, amitriptyline, duloxetine, gabapentin, and pregabalin are effective at reducing neuropathic pain and are safe and cost-effective.<ul><li>A NICE surveillance report [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">NICE, 2019b</a>] concluded that the evidence for gabapentin and pregabalin in treating sciatica is insufficient, and topic experts were concerned about the use of these drugs for this condition. </li><li>Note: it is expected that the NICE guidance [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">NICE, 2019a</a>] will be updated and focus on whether gabapentin and pregabalin are suitable treatments for sciatica.</li></ul></li><li>The NICE guideline development group (GDG) was unable to recommend one drug as clearly superior to the others because of the variations between the included studies that led to considerable uncertainty about the relative efficacy of the different drugs. The NICE GDG, therefore, advises that the choice of treatment should be made on an individual basis, taking into account factors such as the underlying cause of pain, comorbidities, vulnerability to adverse effects, and personal preference [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">NICE, 2019a</a>]. </li><li>A Cochrane systematic review of 37 studies (n = 5914) that assessed the analgesic efficacy of gabapentin in chronic neuropathic pain in adults concluded that gabapentin at doses of 1800 mg to 3600 mg daily can provide good levels of pain relief to some people with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and peripheral diabetic neuropathy, although evidence for other types of neuropathic pain was very limited [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">Wiffen, 2017</a>]. </li><li>A Cochrane systematic review of 45 studies (n = 11,906) that assessed the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of pregabalin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults found evidence of efficacy for pregabalin in PHN, painful diabetic neuralgia, and mixed or unclassified post-traumatic neuropathic pain, absence of efficacy in HIV neuropathy and inadequate evidence of efficacy in central neuropathic pain. It concluded that some people will derive substantial benefit with pregabalin; more will have moderate benefit, but many will have no benefit or will discontinue treatment [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">Derry, 2019</a>]. </li></ul><h5>Titrating drug treatments</h5><ul><li>Owing to the risk of adverse effects associated with these drugs, the manufacturers of gabapentin, duloxetine, and pregabalin recommend starting with a low dose and titrating up to the minimum effective dose [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">ABPI, 2020a</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">ABPI, 2020b</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">ABPI, 2020c</a>]. </li><li>Titration of treatment is recommended when tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are used in the management of depression, to reduce the risk of adverse effects [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">Taylor, 2018</a>]. CKS considers it prudent to use a similar approach when starting a TCA that is being used to manage neuropathic pain.</li></ul><h5>Prescribing gabapentin or pregabalin</h5><ul><li>Gabapentin and pregabalin were reclassified as Schedule 3 controlled drugs in 2019 owing to the risk of abuse and dependence, and are subject to the regulations that apply to that class of drugs [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">MHRA, 2019</a>]. <ul><li>The Department of Health and Social Care has issued strong recommendations that the maximum quantity of Schedule 3 drugs prescribed should not exceed 30 days [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">NHS England, 2019</a>].  </li></ul></li><li>NICE recommends that before prescribing gabapentin or pregabalin people should be carefully evaluated for a history of drug abuse and observed for the development of signs of abuse and dependence [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">NICE, 2019a</a>].  </li><li>The MHRA advises that clinicians should [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">MHRA, 2019</a>]: <ul><li>Evaluate patients carefully for a history of drug abuse and dependence before prescribing pregabalin and gabapentin.</li><li>Observe patients on pregabalin and gabapentin for possible signs of abuse and dependence, for example, drug-seeking behaviour, dose-escalation, and development of tolerance.</li><li>Ensure patients are aware of the risk of potentially fatal interactions with other medicines that cause central nervous system depression, particularly opioid medicines, and with alcohol.</li><li>Report suspected adverse drug reactions to pregabalin and gabapentin on a Yellow Card, including cases of abuse and dependence.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Combination treatment</h5><ul><li>Owing to the lack of evidence for the effectiveness of combining treatments, the NICE GDG does not currently recommend any combination treatments for neuropathic pain [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">NICE, 2019a</a>]. <ul><li>However, the GDG noted that combination treatment may be more practical and more effective than switching to a new treatment and may reduce adverse effects of the individual drugs owing to the combination of lower doses.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Early follow up</h5><ul><li>In the expert opinion of the NICE GDG, an early clinical review is important to assess the progress made with titration and the effectiveness and tolerability of the treatment. This allows any necessary treatment adjustments to be made promptly in order to ensure optimal pain control [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">NICE, 2019a</a>]. </li><li>CKS recommends using clinical judgement to decide how soon to follow up a person with neuropathic pain because the urgency of a follow up will depend on several factors, including the cause of neuropathic pain, severity of pain, treatment prescribed, and the complexity of the titration process.</li></ul><h5>Referral</h5><ul><li>NICE recommends considering referral (to specialist pain services or a condition-specific service) at any stage (including at initial presentation and at regular clinical reviews) if pain is severe, pain significantly limits daily activities and quality of life, or any underlying health condition has deteriorated, because [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">NICE, 2019a</a>]: <ul><li>Specialist pain services provide comprehensive assessment and multimodal management of all types of pain, including neuropathic pain.</li><li>A condition-specific service (for example oncology, neurology, or diabetology) will provide treatment for the underlying health condition that is causing neuropathic pain.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Considering tramadol whilst awaiting referral</h5><ul><li>The NICE GDG identified evidence from five small studies (n = 374) showing that tramadol is effective at reducing neuropathic pain compared with placebo. However, because of the small sample size in the included studies, the short study periods (up to 4 weeks), and the higher rates of withdrawals due to adverse effects associated with tramadol treatment, the GDG concluded that tramadol should only be considered as a rescue medication when people are awaiting referral to specialist pain services after initial treatment has failed [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">NICE, 2019a</a>].</li><li>NICE does not give a recommended duration of treatment with tramadol but states that it should be considered for short-term use only. CKS recommends that tramadol should be prescribed cautiously because of the potential for addiction.</li></ul><h5>Treatments not recommended in primary care</h5><ul><li>The following drugs are not recommended by NICE for the treatment of neuropathic pain in primary care owing to a lack of consistent evidence for their effectiveness, evidence of inferiority compared with placebo or other treatments, and/or evidence of a higher risk of adverse effects compared with other drugs [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">NICE, 2019a</a>]:<ul><li>Cannabis sativa extract.</li><li>Capsaicin patch.<ul><li>However, SIGN recommends that topical capsaicin patches (8%) should be considered in the treatment of patients with peripheral neuropathic pain when first-line pharmacological therapies have been ineffective or are not tolerated [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">SIGN, 2019</a>]. </li><li>A Cochrane systematic review of eight studies (n =  2488) found moderate-quality evidence that high-concentration (8%) capsaicin patches can give moderate pain relief, or better, to a minority of people with PHN, and very low-quality evidence that it benefits those with HIV neuropathy and peripheral diabetic neuropathy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">Derry, 2017</a>].  </li></ul></li><li>Imipramine.</li><li>Lacosamide.</li><li>Lamotrigine.</li><li>Levetiracetam.</li><li>Morphine.</li><li>Nortriptyline.</li><li>Oxcarbazepine.</li><li>Sodium valproate.</li><li>Topiramate.</li><li>Tramadol (long-term use).</li><li>Venlafaxine.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Lidocaine patches</h5><ul><li>Lidocaine patches are licensed for use in neuropathic pain associated with PHN [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">ABPI, 2018</a>]. However, they are neither recommended as a treatment option by NICE nor are they not listed as a treatment that should not be used [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">NICE, 2019a</a>].</li><li>There is a lack of evidence to support the use of lidocaine patches in neuropathic pain [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">NICE, 2019a</a>].<ul><li>NICE identified one small crossover study (n = 28) on topical lidocaine, which showed no effect on pain reduction. </li></ul></li><li>A Cochrane systematic review of 12 studies (n = 508) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">Derry, 2014</a>] found no evidence from good quality randomized controlled trials to support the use of topical lidocaine to treat neuropathic pain, although individual studies indicated that it was effective for relief of pain.  </li><li>In a position statement, <em>Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters for localised neuropathic pain</em>, the British Pain Society (BPS) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">BPS, 2018</a>] states that the marketing authorization was granted for PHN alone as it was the only type of peripheral neuropathic pain studied in the registration trials, and that since then there has been considerable experience from pain specialists prescribing lidocaine 5% medicated plasters in other types of peripheral localized neuropathic pain and that current international guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">Finnerup, 2015</a>] suggest that lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are an established second-line treatment for peripheral neuropathic pain.<ul><li>The organization endorses the NICE guideline statement \"Continue existing treatments for people whose neuropathic pain is already effectively managed, taking into account the need for regular clinical reviews\", and<em> </em>states that while NHS England recommends that lidocaine 5% medicated plasters should not routinely be prescribed in primary care, it suggests that if a person is referred to a specialist pain service and their expert advice is to use lidocaine 5% medicated plasters then treatment should continue to be funded in primary care. It goes on to say that people who have already been prescribed lidocaine 5% medicated plasters should be reviewed to assess efficacy, and where there is evidence of substantial benefit people should not be disadvantaged by prescribing being discontinued.</li></ul></li><li>SIGN recommends that topical lidocaine should be considered for treatment of patients with PHN if first-line pharmacological therapies have been ineffective [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">SIGN, 2019</a>]. </li></ul><!-- end field b0e81eed-b12d-4331-af2b-40a894217412 --><!-- end item 7382b846-6868-4155-b5da-5b88aae7b6e1 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"747c62d6-6e38-54c7-bb19-beecf8f2d188","slug":"follow-up","fullItemName":"Follow up","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field fdf88905-b997-4114-8d63-55b9bfd3d9d9 --><h3>How should I follow up a person being treated for neuropathic pain?</h3><!-- end field fdf88905-b997-4114-8d63-55b9bfd3d9d9 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 69654567-2f88-4ec7-8d8b-7149c25e86b5 --><!-- begin field b47678b9-9254-44ae-abef-b0fa2d51a754 --><ul><li><strong>Carry out an early review after starting or changing treatment.

However, because of the small sample size in the included studies, the short study periods (up to 4 weeks), and the higher rates of withdrawals owing to adverse effects associated with tramadol treatment, the GDG concluded that tramadol should only be considered as a rescue medication when people are awaiting referral to specialist pain services after initial treatment has failed [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/neuropathic-pain-drug-treatment/references/\">NICE, 2019a</a>]. </li><li>NICE does not give a recommended duration of treatment with tramadol but states that it should be considered for short-term use only.
