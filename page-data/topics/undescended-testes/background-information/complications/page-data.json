Undescended testes that remain in the abdomen, inguinal canal, or groin at a higher temperature may result in germ cell damage, which affects their transformation into stem cells for subsequent spermatogenesis and may result in reduced fertility rates [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/undescended-testes/references/\">Hutson, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/undescended-testes/references/\">Yeap, 2019</a>]. This effect is greater if both testes are undescended, and multiple factors may be involved, including germ cell loss, impaired germ cell maturation, and testicular fibrosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/undescended-testes/references/\">Radmayr, 2016</a>].</li><li>The fertility rate (number of offspring born per mating pair) and paternity rate (percentage of men who successfully achieve conception) varies with the location and cause of undescended testis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/undescended-testes/references/\">Yeap, 2019</a>].<ul><li>In men with unilateral undescended testis, 83% have a normal sperm count, and the paternity rate is up to 89% compared with 94% in the general population.</li><li>In men with bilateral undescended testes despite surgery, the infertility rate may be up to 56%, which is six times that of the general population, and the paternity rate may be 62%.</li><li>In men with inguinal testes the paternity rate is 90%, and men with intra-abdominal testes have a paternity rate of 83.3%.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Testicular cancer</strong><ul><li>A meta-analysis of nine case-control studies and three cohort studies found that testicular cancer is three times more common in men with a history of undescended testes compared with controls, however, significant heterogeneity was noted between the included studies [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/undescended-testes/references/\">Lip et al, 2013</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article notes that the risk of testicular cancer is four to five times higher in men with a history of undescended testes than in the general population [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/undescended-testes/references/\">Yeap, 2019</a>].<ul><li>The risk is higher in boys with bilateral undescended testes than in those with unilateral undescended testis.</li><li>The risk is highest in those with intra-abdominal testes.</li><li>In particular, there is an increased risk of testicular seminomas (germ cell tumours) in young men with a history of congenital undescended testes.</li><li>Overall, the risk of developing testicular cancer in men with a history of undescended testes is around 2–3%.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Testicular torsion</strong><ul><li>The American Urological Association guidelines note that undescended testes are more likely to undergo torsion than scrotal testes [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/undescended-testes/references/\">Kolon, 2014</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article notes that men with undescended testes are more likely to experience testicular torsion compared with the general population, and this risk may be associated with the duration of undescended testes [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/undescended-testes/references/\">Abaci, 2013</a>].</li></ul></li><li><strong>Inguinal hernia</strong><ul><li>Expert opinion in a review article notes that an associated inguinal hernia may occur in some boys with undescended testes [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/undescended-testes/references/\">Radmayr, 2016</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field ddffed22-89b6-4815-950e-383aa2e2eba1 --><!-- end item 30b408a9-a17e-4892-91f1-640f0cd2e7a5 -->","topic":{"id":"10d1da26-55d5-5f47-9586-db750662ebbf","topicId":"a2bd1fe7-d3ef-4758-8cbf-9e743ec8cc79","topicName":"Undescended testes","slug":"undescended-testes","lastRevised":"Last revised in February 2020","chapters":[{"id":"7862c248-9fec-5b78-abf5-99dbb1b8d8cf","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"d36763d7-a93c-59c8-bd4a-585e74cf284a","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"c546f384-4b22-5201-b019-43f060e0c6b3","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"5c44f728-bb6d-590f-b736-a5b630b89d14","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"7398388d-7e07-5f74-a3a6-d3b121f13a14","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"1358ac2f-34e1-520a-958b-8ee27a1009fc","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"2491ccd5-dd46-56e0-9d0d-23d33dc55c4f","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"b991039c-22b8-5e77-8f53-c52aedb6ed1c","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"da45700a-e9e0-54ae-aed3-b737d86321ec","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"624ec781-2bfc-579e-9482-69ec46ac6424","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"c7e7337c-a060-54d9-adcc-fd73b35a2a30","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
