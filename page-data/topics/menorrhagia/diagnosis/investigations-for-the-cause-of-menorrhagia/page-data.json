National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline <em>Heavy menstrual bleeding: assessment and management</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/menorrhagia/references/\">NICE, 2018</a>]. NICE based these recommendations on the available evidence for diagnostic accuracy. For full details of the evidence and the NICE guideline development committee's discussion, see <a data-hyperlink-id=\"d322d052-18f3-44c8-a192-a9ac01525c69\" href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng88/evidence/a-diagnostic-test-accuracy-pdf-4782293101\" target=\"_top\">NICE evidence review A: diagnostic test accuracy in investigation for women presenting with heavy menstrual bleeding</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>For women with suspected submucosal fibroids, polyps, or endometrial pathology:</strong><ul><li>Outpatient hysteroscopy is recommended because:<ul><li>Evidence identified by NICE showed that it is more accurate (higher sensitivity and specificity) in identifying uterine cavity abnormalities or endometrial pathology than pelvic ultrasound.</li><li>It is safe and has a low risk of complications.</li><li>It is acceptable to women if done according to best practice guidelines.</li><li>Women can have submucosal fibroids and polyps removed during the procedure, and targeted biopsy if needed.</li><li>It is cost-effective as part of a diagnosis and treatment strategy.</li></ul></li><li>The NICE guideline development committee agreed that:<ul><li>For women who decline outpatient hysteroscopy, hysteroscopy under general or regional anaesthetic should be offered because the benefits of accurate identification outweigh the risks of anaesthesia.</li><li>For women who decline hysteroscopy under general or regional anaesthetic, pelvic ultrasound can be considered provided that they understand and accept that it is less accurate in detecting uterine cavity abnormalities and endometrial pathology.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>For women with a large fibroid or several fibroids:</strong><ul><li>The NICE guideline development committee recommends pelvic ultrasound (transvaginal or transabdominal) instead of hysteroscopy because:<ul><li>Hysteroscopy is not able to detect abnormalities outside the uterine cavity, such as subserous or intramural fibroids, or adenomyosis.</li><li>It is likely to be particularly cost-effective in this context.</li></ul></li><li>The committee agreed that if abdominal or vaginal examination is difficult to perform or inconclusive (for example because the woman is obese), pelvic ultrasound would be helpful to identify any abnormalities that might have otherwise been suggested by examination.</li></ul></li><li><strong>For women with suspected adenomyosis:</strong><ul><li>Evidence identified by NICE showed that transvaginal ultrasound is more accurate than transabdominal ultrasound or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)<strong> </strong>for detecting adenomyosis. Although transvaginal ultrasound is more intrusive than the other investigations, the committee's experience suggests that many women find it acceptable. It is also widely available in secondary care, and sometimes in primary care.</li><li>For women in whom transvaginal ultrasound is unacceptable or unsuitable, such as women who have not been sexually active or women with female genital mutilation, the committee agreed that transabdominal ultrasound or MRI can be considered, provided that the women understand and accept that they are less accurate for detecting adenomyosis.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Impact on practice</h4><ul><li>The NICE guideline development committee noted that these new recommendations may impact current practice.<ul><li>Hysteroscopy, in preference to pelvic ultrasound, for women with menorrhagia who are suspected of having submucosal fibroids, polyps, or endometrial pathology will have a resource impact on service organization and training.<ul><li>Ultrasound is available through direct booking in primary care, whereas hysteroscopy is not. Therefore, changes to services will be needed to allow direct access booking into one-stop hysteroscopy services and ideally to increase delivery in community-based clinics.</li><li>To ensure that outpatient hysteroscopy is acceptable to women, it is essential that the procedure is done according to best practice guidelines, including techniques and equipment to minimize discomfort and pain in women; adequately sized, equipped, and staffed facilities; staff with necessary training, skills, and expertise; and the need for audit and benchmarking of outcomes.</li></ul></li><li>Transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasound are already widely available in secondary care and sometimes in primary care. However, clinicians might need additional training and experience in interpreting transvaginal ultrasound scans to identify signs of adenomyosis.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 554ff84f-a589-495d-b4f4-252f65a74d0b --><!-- end item bae8a731-bdf5-4078-9539-d6edccc411ec -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
