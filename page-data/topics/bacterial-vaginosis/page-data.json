The vagina loses its normal acidity, and its pH increases to greater than 4.5.</li><li>Factors that increase the risk of developing BV include:<ul><li>Being sexually active — BV is not a sexually transmitted infection (STI), but being sexually active or having concurrent STIs increases the risk of developing BV.</li><li>The use of douches, deodorant, and vaginal washes; menstruation; and presence of semen in the vagina.</li><li>Copper intrauterine device.</li><li>Smoking.</li></ul></li><li>Factors that reduce the risk of developing BV include:<ul><li>The use of hormonal contraception.</li><li>Consistent condom use.</li><li>Circumcised partner.</li></ul></li><li>BV is the most common cause of abnormal vaginal discharge in women of child-bearing age, but may also be encountered in perimenopausal women.</li><li>Women with BV are at increased risk of acquiring STIs, including HIV. BV is also associated with several obstetric and gynecologic complications, including late miscarriage, pre-term labour, pre-term birth, pre-term premature rupture of membranes, low birthweight, and postpartum endometritis.</li><li>Approximately 50% of women with BV are asymptomatic. When symptoms are present, BV is characterized by a fishy-smelling vaginal discharge. It is not usually associated with soreness, itching, or irritation. </li><li>Examination may reveal a thin, white, homogeneous discharge coating the walls of the vagina and vestibule.</li><li>In women with characteristic symptoms of BV, examination and further tests may be omitted and empirical treatment started if all the following apply:<ul><li>The woman is at low risk of an STI.</li><li>The woman does not have symptoms of other conditions.</li><li>Symptoms have not developed pre or post a gynaecological procedure.</li><li>The woman is not postnatal or post miscarriage.</li><li>The woman is not pre or post termination of pregnancy.</li><li>This is a first episode of suspected BV, or if recurrent, a previous episode of recognizably similar symptoms was previously diagnosed to be BV following examination.</li><li>The woman is not pregnant. </li></ul></li><li>Non-pregnant women with asymptomatic BV do not usually require treatment. For symptomatic women:<ul><li>Oral metronidazole is the treatment of choice.</li><li>Intravaginal metronidazole gel or intravaginal clindamycin cream are alternative choices.</li><li>Oral clindamycin and oral tinidazole are alternatives but are less preferred.</li></ul></li><li>Routine screening for BV should not be offered to pregnant women. However, if a pregnant woman is incidentally found to have asymptomatic BV, the woman's obstetrician should be consulted as to whether treatment is appropriate. For symptomatic pregnant women:<ul><li>Oral metronidazole is the treatment of choice.</li><li>Intravaginal metronidazole gel or intravaginal clindamycin cream are alternative choices.</li><li>Oral clindamycin may be considered but is less preferred.</li></ul></li><li>All women with BV should be advised to avoid exposure to contributing factors, where possible.</li><li>If symptoms persist or recur after initial treatment:<ul><li>Adherence with initial treatment should be checked.</li><li>The diagnosis of BV should be reconsidered.</li><li>Continued exposure to contributing factors should be checked.</li><li>Adequate management of the current episode should be ensured. </li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 555b7721-d90c-419d-91e7-4d47737fe666 --><!-- end item
