essential when managing a woman with vaginal discharge because [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bacterial-vaginosis/references/\">Lazaro,

transmitted infections (STIs) may be missed if a sensitive sexual history is not taken. </li></ul></li></ul><h4>Examination and investigations</h4><ul><li>Expert opinion in the RCGP/BASHH guideline is that examination is not always needed in women with uncomplicated vaginal discharge. However [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bacterial-vaginosis/references/\">Lazaro, 2013</a>]:<ul><li>The prescriber should take a thorough history and not simply rely on the woman’s self-diagnosis.</li><li>Women with recurrent symptoms or those who fail to improve should be examined and investigated.</li><li>Certain conditions should prompt an appropriate examination and investigations first-line.</li></ul></li><li>PHE recommends that women of reproductive age with vaginal discharge should have a high vaginal swab taken for culture if [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/bacterial-vaginosis/references/\">PHE, 2013</a>]:<ul><li>They are postnatal or post miscarriage.</li><li>They have vaginitis without discharge.</li><li>They are pre or post gynaecological surgery.</li><li>They are pre or post termination of pregnancy.</li><li>Symptoms are not characteristic of BV.</li><li>Within 3 weeks of intrauterine contraceptive insertion.</li><li>The condition is recurrent (4 cases a year or more).</li><li>A previous treatment failed.</li></ul></li><li>CKS found no guidelines specifically regarding examination and investigation in pregnant women. However, making an accurate diagnosis and excluding other causes for symptoms seem prudent, given the potential adverse outcomes of BV in pregnancy and that the recommended treatment is with antibiotics.<ul><li>Previous expert reviewers of this CKS topic agreed that examination and testing should always be done in pregnant women with BV because the symptoms and clinical signs of BV are less reliable in pregnancy and because of the altered risk-to-benefit ratio.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 07c0b9ee-903c-44eb-a127-8513e142b4a2 --><!-- end item b96ffb00-d5ef-40ee-b9d7-c1b9ec83adeb -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
