that combined oral contraceptive treatment (which will mask diagnosis by suppressing hyperandrogenemia) is not unnecessarily delayed [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">Rosenfield, 2015</a>].</li></ul><h4>Diagnosing PCOS in adults</h4><ul><li>This recommendation is based on the <em>Revised 2003 consensus on

class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group, 2004</a>].<ul><li>The Rotterdam criteria are endorsed in several national and international guidelines, including the<em> </em>Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) guideline <em>Long-term Consequences of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">RCOG, 2014</a>], <em>The polycystic ovary syndrome: a

class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">Azziz et al, 2009</a>].<ul><li>Only a minority of this task force considered that PCOS could exist without hyperandrogenism and suggested that PCOS should be defined by two criteria: the presence of hyperandrogenism (biochemical or clinical) and ovarian dysfunction (oligo- or anovulation or polycystic ovaries).</li><li>However, the Rotterdam consensus definition provides a helpful framework, and too exclusive a definition would leave many women with PCOS who are at the milder end of the spectrum without a diagnosis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">Balen et al, 2009</a>].</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>The RCOG points out that the diagnosis of PCOS can only be made when other aetiologies for irregular cycles, such as thyroid dysfunction, acromegaly or hyperprolactinaemia, have been excluded if there is clinical suspicion, and that women with non-Caucasian ethnicity might need different criteria to diagnose PCOS [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">RCOG, 2014</a>].</li></ul><h4>Diagnosing PCOS in adolescents</h4><ul><li>There is no consensus on the clinical criteria to reach the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents.</li><li>These recommendations are based largely on the <em>International evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome 2018 </em>published by the International PCOS Network [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">International PCOS Network, 2018</a>] and <em>The Diagnosis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome during Adolescence, </em>which represents the consensus of paediatric endocrine and adolescent medicine experts representing paediatric subspecialty societies [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">Witchel, 2015</a>].  <ul><li>The International PCOS Network recommends tighter criteria requiring both hyperandrogenism and irregular cycles, with ultrasound not indicated, in the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents, due to overlap with normal reproductive physiology.</li><li>Expert opinion in the consensus guideline is that the diagnostic criteria for PCOS in adolescence is challenging, primarily because the diagnostic pathological features used in adult women, for example, acne, irregular menses, and polycystic ovary morphology, may be normal pubertal physiological events [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">Witchel, 2015</a>].</li><li>Both guidelines recommend that girls who have features of PCOS but do not meet the diagnostic criteria should be considered to be 'at risk' for PCOS. To avoid misdiagnosing physiological pubertal changes as PCOS, deferred diagnostic labelling accompanied by reassessment at or before full reproductive maturity (8 years post-menarche) is recommended [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">Witchel, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">International PCOS Network, 2018</a>].</li></ul></li><li>Although obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperinsulinemia are common findings in adolescents with hyperandrogenism, experts advise that these features should not be used to diagnose PCOS among adolescent girls, as they are not always present [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">Rosenfield, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">Witchel, 2015</a>].</li></ul><h4>Ethnic variations in PCOS</h4><ul><li>The RCOG highlights that women with non-Caucasian ethnicity might need different criteria to diagnose PCOS [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">RCOG, 2014</a>] due to ethnic variations.</li><li>Ethnic variations in PCOS include [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">International PCOS Network, 2018</a>]:<ul><li>Relatively mild phenotypes in Caucasians.</li><li>Higher body mass index (BMI) in Caucasians, especially North America and Australia.</li><li>More severe hirsutism in Middle Eastern, Hispanic, and Mediterranean women.</li><li>Increased central adiposity, insulin resistance, diabetes, metabolic risks, and acanthosis nigricans in South East Asians and Indigenous Australians.</li><li>Lower BMI and milder hirsutism in East Asians.</li><li>Higher BMI and metabolic features in Africans.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 58974962-44c0-4674-a953-b182a2b789a9 --><!-- end item 78e0b79b-28ee-460b-aedd-0f33abd50d0b -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
