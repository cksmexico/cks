This is independent of obesity, but is further exacerbated by excess weight [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">International PCOS Network, 2018</a>].</li><li>About 20–40% of obese women with PCOS have glucose intolerance or type 2 diabetes by the end of their fourth decade [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">BMJ, 2018</a>].</li><li>Earlier onset hyperglycaemia and rapid progression to type 2 diabetes is also reported in PCOS [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">RCOG, 2014</a>].</li></ul></li><li><strong>Cardiovascular disease (CVD)</strong><ul><li>There is some evidence that women with PCOS have more risk factors for CVD (in particular, central obesity, hypertriglyceridaemia, decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and hypertension) than women of the same age without PCOS [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">Wild et al, 2010</a>]. </li><li>Limited evidence from a small subgroup analysis suggests that postmenopausal women with clinical features of PCOS may be at increased risk of cardiovascular events and death [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">Shaw et al, 2008</a>].</li><li>CVD risk factors beyond standard recognized risks (identified as 'novel risk factors') and early onset cardiovascular dysfunction (including endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, plaques, and coronary artery calcification) have been noted in women with PCOS and are related to insulin resistance and obesity [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">RCOG, 2014</a>].</li><li>High androgen levels and low sex hormone binding globulin levels have also been linked to increased CVD risk in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women with PCOS [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">RCOG, 2014</a>].</li><li>Type 2 diabetes is a major CVD risk factor, and insulin resistance has been shown to worsen CVD risk in PCOS [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">RCOG, 2014</a>]. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Infertility</strong><ul><li>PCOS is the single most common cause of infertility in young women [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">Rosenfield, 2015</a>].</li><li>It is the underlying cause in 75% of women who have infertility due to anovulation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">Balen, 2010</a>].</li></ul></li><li><strong>Pregnancy complications</strong><ul><li>Women with PCOS have a clinically significant increased risk of pregnancy complications compared with women without PCOS [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">Palomba, 2015</a>].</li><li>Regardless of age, the prevalence of gestational diabetes is significantly increased in PCOS.

They are also at a higher risk of developing psychological difficulties (such as depression and/or anxiety), eating disorders, and sexual and relationship dysfunction [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">RCOG, 2014</a>].</li><li>There is a likely increased prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety and depressive symptoms in adolescents with PCOS [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">International PCOS Network, 2018</a>].</li><li>The cause of depressive and anxiety symptoms in PCOS are not fully elucidated but are thought to include symptoms such as acne, hirsutism, infertility, and obesity. The chronic, complex, and frustrating nature of the condition is also thought to contribute to depressive and anxiety symptoms in PCOS [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">International PCOS Network, 2018</a>].</li></ul></li><li><strong>Obstructive sleep apnoea</strong><ul><li>The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea is increased in obese women with PCOS [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">RCOG, 2014</a>].</li><li>Limited evidence suggests that obstructive sleep apnoea is more common in obese PCOS women (both in adolescents and during reproductive years) compared with the general population [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">Conway, 2014</a>].</li><li>BMI, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance are risk factors for the development of sleep disorders in PCOS, and androgen excess may be associated with the presence of obstructive sleep apnoea in women with PCOS [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polycystic-ovary-syndrome/references/\">Conway, 2014</a>].<br> </li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 88212b3a-ef40-4a5d-9b0d-e6ab29193479 --><!-- end item 29216dc3-a88c-4cc3-adfc-15d88ad1581c -->","topic":{"id":"daaf23b6-59bf-5fa9-96d9-6d98f028d2bd","topicId":"90f70ae3-1caf-4e74-8397-cf2655cfb10c","topicName":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","slug":"polycystic-ovary-syndrome","lastRevised":"Last revised in September 2018","chapters":[{"id":"6f41b5a4-2e7e-5469-91c8-15331570cb8c","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"5ad66803-f217-58c6-ad92-d9db6491cb26","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"132cf0f7-983a-59b8-aa99-10f350089b7c","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"d45a2f22-c9b6-5ee0-afb6-8ae3d0397d9f","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"e3852569-27c3-5e63-ab2f-2b92dcfe5262","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"f1fe2489-77fe-5403-977f-d3603e5bae1e","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"048d9ada-61af-59a9-971e-42aed733010a","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"845cd360-b1c4-50ee-a60f-5ec2ce05b2b8","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"6bed55f9-2ee7-578e-8770-b9a5e2053955","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"0afb7a34-d84c-5ad9-bcc3-0dc5345cd2b8","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"f7587b9f-e03a-5ba0-b6c5-173412097eb9","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
