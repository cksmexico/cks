The clinical features may include hyperandrogenism (with the clinical manifestations of oligomenorrhoea, hirsutism, and acne), ovulation disorders, and polycystic ovarian morphology.</li><li>It is one of the most common endocrine disorders affecting women of reproductive age.</li><li>The cause of PCOS is unknown. It is likely to be multifactorial, with both genetic and environmental factors playing a part.</li><li>Complications include:<ul><li>Metabolic disorders, such as impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes.</li><li>Cardiovascular disease.</li><li>Infertility.</li><li>Pregnancy complications, such as pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes.</li><li>Endometrial cancer.</li><li>Psychological disorders, such as anxiety and depression.</li><li>Obstructive sleep apnoea.</li></ul></li><li>To help diagnose PCOS:<ul><li>Free androgen index should be calculated to assess the amount of physiologically active testosterone present. </li><li>Luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels should be measured to rule out other causes of oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea (such as premature ovarian failure, hypothyroidism, and hyperprolactinaemia).</li><li>Referral for ultrasound scan is required in adult women (unless the diagnosis of PCOS is obvious on clinical and biochemical ground). Ultrasound scan should not be used for the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents due to the high incidence of multi-follicular ovaries in this life stage.</li></ul></li><li>In adults, PCOS should be diagnosed if two out of three of the following criteria are present, provided other causes of menstrual disturbance and hyperandrogenism have been excluded:<ul><li>Clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism.</li><li>Oligo-anovulation or anovulation.</li><li>Polycystic ovaries, defined as the presence of 12 or more follicles (measuring 2–9 mm in diameter) in one or both ovaries and/or increased ovarian volume (more than 10 cm<sup>3</sup>).</li></ul></li><li>When diagnosing PCOS in adolescents, tighter criteria requiring both hyperandrogenism and irregular menstrual cycles is recommended due to the overlap with normal pubertal reproductive physiology. </li><li>Management of PCOS includes:<ul><li>Advising on a healthy lifestyle and measures to reduce cardiovascular risk. Where appropriate, weight loss should be advised.</li><li>Offering screening for impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes.</li><li>Offering screening for cardiovascular risk factors.</li><li>Managing the clinical features of PCOS, including oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea, acne, hirsutism, and infertility.</li><li>Managing complications of PCOS, including sleep apnoea and psychological disorders.</li><li>Referring women with PCOS who are pregnant or considering pregnancy to be screened for gestational diabetes, and considering whether any changes to drug treatment(s) should be made (for example, metformin is not recommended in pregnancy).</li><li>Providing sources of additional information and support.</li></ul></li><li>Adolescents who have features of PCOS but do not meet the diagnostic criteria should be considered to be at 'increased risk' of PCOS and reassessed at or before full reproductive maturity (8 years post-menarche). This includes those with PCOS features before combined oral contraceptive pill commencement, those with persisting features, and those with significant weight gain in adolescence.</li></ul><!-- end field 3f1b5cb8-f945-45e1-9c01-32dfeb0694ab --><!-- end item 391970ff-7b4d-4615-8d43-82b95eaea243 -->","topic":{"id":"daaf23b6-59bf-5fa9-96d9-6d98f028d2bd","topicId":"90f70ae3-1caf-4e74-8397-cf2655cfb10c","topicName":"Polycystic ovary syndrome","slug":"polycystic-ovary-syndrome","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"6f41b5a4-2e7e-5469-91c8-15331570cb8c","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"5ad66803-f217-58c6-ad92-d9db6491cb26","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"132cf0f7-983a-59b8-aa99-10f350089b7c","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"d45a2f22-c9b6-5ee0-afb6-8ae3d0397d9f","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"e3852569-27c3-5e63-ab2f-2b92dcfe5262","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"f1fe2489-77fe-5403-977f-d3603e5bae1e","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"048d9ada-61af-59a9-971e-42aed733010a","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"845cd360-b1c4-50ee-a60f-5ec2ce05b2b8","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"6bed55f9-2ee7-578e-8770-b9a5e2053955","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"0afb7a34-d84c-5ad9-bcc3-0dc5345cd2b8","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"f7587b9f-e03a-5ba0-b6c5-173412097eb9","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
