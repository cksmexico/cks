Symptoms are typically worse in the evenings, and are often associated with sleep disturbance.</li><li>The underlying pathophysiology of RLS is not fully understood, although it is likely that there is dysfunction of the dopaminergic system.</li><li>RLS is frequently idiopathic but may be secondary to an underlying condition (most commonly pregnancy, iron deficiency, or stage 5 chronic kidney disease), or the use of certain drugs (for example, some antidepressants, some antipsychotics, and lithium).</li><li>In idiopathic RLS the severity and frequency of symptoms typically increase over time.</li><li>For a diagnosis of RLS to be made, the following criteria must all be present:<ul><li>An urge to move the legs, usually accompanied by, or felt to be caused by, unpleasant sensations.</li><li>Symptoms begin or worsen during periods of rest or inactivity such as lying down or sitting.</li><li>Symptoms are partially or totally relieved by movement, such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues.</li><li>Symptoms during rest or inactivity only occur, or are worse, in the evening or night.</li><li>The above features are not primarily caused by another medical or behavioural condition (for example, leg cramps or habitual foot tapping).</li></ul></li><li>Differential diagnoses of RLS include: nocturnal leg cramps, peripheral neuropathy, akathisia, and intermittent claudication.</li><li>There are no specific investigations to confirm the diagnosis of idiopathic RLS. The following investigations may help identify an underlying cause:<ul><li>Serum ferritin (to identify iron deficiency).</li><li>Other investigations (such as renal function, full blood count, thyroid function, blood glucose, vitamin B12) as guided by the history and examination.</li></ul></li><li>Any underlying cause or exacerbating factors of RLS should be addressed, as symptoms may resolve if the underlying condition is treated.</li><li>Self-help advice that may ease symptoms of RLS include measures to:<ul><li>Prevent an attack, such as good sleep hygiene, reducing caffeine and alcohol consumption, stopping smoking, and taking moderate regular exercise.</li><li>Relieve an attack, such as walking and stretching, application of heat with heat pads or a hot bath, relaxation exercises, mental distraction at times of rest, and massaging affected limbs.</li></ul></li><li>For people with mild symptoms, explanation, reassurance, and self-help measures may be sufficient.</li><li>For people with moderate to severe symptoms, drug treatment is an option with either a non-ergot dopamine agonist (pramipexole, ropinirole, or rotigotine), or an alpha-2-delta ligand (pregabalin or gabapentin — both off-label indications).<ul><li>A weak opioid (such as codeine) is an alternative for people with painful symptoms.</li><li>A short or intermittent course of a hypnotic drug (such as a Z-drug) may be considered for people with significant sleep disturbance due to RLS.</li></ul></li><li>Referral to a neurologist or sleep specialist may be required if there is doubt about the diagnosis, or if treatment is unsuccessful.</li></ul><!-- end field 088cb86c-5e43-436f-85e5-115553c0d4d6 --><!-- end item f29ce708-4f4e-43f9-84d2-b0ad8cc92572
