Therefore, the clinical diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia can be informed by other clinical signs or symptoms such as:<ul><li>Temperature above 38°C.</li><li>Respiratory rate above 20 breaths per minute.</li><li>Heart rate above 100 beats per minute.</li><li>New confusion.</li></ul></li><li>Assessing shortness of breath is important but may be difficult by remote consultation. Tools such as the Medical Research Council's dyspnoea scale can provide a measure of how breathless a person has become.</li></ul><div><strong>Assessing severity</strong></div><ul><li>In making an assessment use the following symptoms and signs to help identify people with more severe illness to help make decisions about hospital admission:<ul><li>Severe shortness of breath at rest or difficulty breathing.</li><li>Coughing up blood.</li><li>Blue lips or face.</li><li>Feeling cold and clammy with pale or mottled skin.</li><li>Collapse or fainting (syncope).</li><li>New confusion.</li><li>Becoming difficult to rouse.</li><li>Little or no urine output.</li><li>Use of assessment tools.</li></ul></li><li>Although National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends using the CRB65 tool, it has not been validated in people with COVID‑19. It also requires blood pressure measurement, which may be difficult or inappropriate during the COVID‑19 pandemic and risks cross-contamination.</li><li>Where pulse oximetry is available use oxygen saturation levels below 92% (below 88% in people with COPD) on room air at rest to identify seriously ill people.</li><li>While the ROTH tool has been suggested as an alternative where pulse oximetry is not available, its use has not been validated in people with COVID‑19 and there are concerns that it may underestimate illness severity (see the CEBM's rapid review of the use of the Roth score in remote assessment).</li><li>Use of the NEWS2 tool in the community for predicting the risk of clinical deterioration may be useful. However, a face-to-face consultation should not be arranged solely to calculate a NEWS2 score.</li></ul><div><strong>Differentiating viral COVID-19 pneumonia from bacterial pneumonia</strong></div><ul><li>It is difficult to determine whether pneumonia has a COVID‑19 viral cause or a bacterial cause (either primary or secondary to COVID‑19) in primary care, particularly during remote consultations. However, as COVID‑19 becomes more prevalent in the community, people presenting with pneumonia symptoms are more likely to have a COVID‑19 viral pneumonia than a community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.</li><li>COVID‑19 viral pneumonia may be more likely if the person:<ul><li>Presents with a history of typical COVID‑19 symptoms for about a week.</li><li>Has severe muscle pain (myalgia).</li><li>Has loss of sense of smell (anosmia).</li><li>Is breathless but has no pleuritic pain.</li><li>Has a history of exposure to known or suspected COVID‑19, such as a household or workplace contact.</li></ul></li><li>A bacterial cause of pneumonia may be more likely if the person:<ul><li>Becomes rapidly unwell after only a few days of symptoms.</li><li>Does not have a history of typical COVID‑19 symptoms.</li><li>Has pleuritic pain.</li><li>Has purulent sputum.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Deciding about hospital admission</h4><ul><li>Be aware that older people, or those with comorbidities, frailty, impaired immunity, or a reduced ability to cough and clear secretions, are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 related pneumonia. Because this can lead to respiratory failure and death, hospital admission would have been the usual recommendation for these people before the COVID‑19 pandemic.</li><li>When making decisions about hospital admission, take into account:<ul><li>The severity of the pneumonia, including symptoms and signs of more severe illness.</li><li>The benefits, risks, and disadvantages of hospital admission.</li><li>The care that can be offered in hospital compared with at home.</li><li>The person's wishes and care plans.</li><li>Service delivery issues and local NHS resources during the COVID‑19 pandemic.</li></ul></li><li>Explain that:<ul><li>The benefits of hospital admission include improved diagnostic tests (chest X-ray, microbiological tests, and blood tests) and respiratory support.</li><li>The risks and disadvantages of hospital admission include spreading or catching COVID‑19 and loss of contact with families.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Managing breathlessness</h4><ul><li>Be aware that severe breathlessness often causes anxiety, which can then increase breathlessness further. See the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/breathlessness/\">Breathlessness</a> for further information.</li></ul><div><strong>Antibiotic treatment</strong></div><ul><li>As COVID‑19 pneumonia is caused by a virus, antibiotics are ineffective.</li><li>NICE advises that antibiotics should not be offered as a treatment for, or prevention of pneumonia if:<ul><li>COVID‑19 is likely to be the cause <em>and</em></li><li>Symptoms are mild.</li></ul></li><li>Offer an oral antibiotic for treatment of pneumonia in people who can or wish to be treated in the community if:<ul><li>The likely cause is bacterial <em>or</em></li><li>It is unclear whether the cause is bacterial or viral and symptoms are more concerning <em>or</em></li><li>They are at high risk of complications because, for example, they are older or frail, or have a pre-existing comorbidity such as immunosuppression or significant heart or lung disease (for example bronchiectasis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) or have a history of severe illness following previous lung infection.</li></ul></li><li>When starting antibiotic treatment, the first-choice oral antibiotic is:<ul><li>Doxycycline 200 mg on the first day, then 100 mg once a day for 5 days in total (not in pregnancy).</li><li>Alternative: amoxicillin 500 mg 3 times a day for 5 days.</li></ul></li><li>Do not routinely use dual antibiotics.</li><li>For choice of antibiotics in penicillin allergy, pregnancy and more severe disease, or if atypical pathogens are likely, see the section on managing community-acquired pneumonia.</li><li>Start antibiotic treatment as soon as possible, taking into account any different methods needed to deliver medicines to people during the COVID‑19 pandemic.</li></ul><div><strong>Oral corticosteroids</strong></div><ul><li>Do not routinely offer a corticosteroid unless the person has other conditions for which these are indicated, such as asthma or COPD.</li></ul><h4>Safety netting and review</h4><ul><li>Advise people to seek medical help without delay if their symptoms do not improve as expected or worsen rapidly or significantly, whether they are taking an antibiotic or not.</li><li>During this reassessment, reconsider whether the person has symptoms and signs of more severe illness and whether there would be a benefit from admission to hospital.</li></ul><!-- end field f4153519-c50d-4175-988e-aba500eca265 --><!-- end item 2a12605b-d150-4606-9627-aba500eca20a

people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and in the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic, National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has made the following recommendations.</p><h4>Modifications to usual care</h4><ul><li>NICE advises that clinicians should consider whether to modify usual care to reduce patient exposure to COVID‑19 and make best use of resources while ensuring that appropriate services are still made available for people. This could include, taking into account their preferences and clinical circumstances for care and treatment, discussing the risks and benefits of these decisions, whilst involving all relevant members of the multidisciplinary team in the decision and recording the reasoning behind each decision.</li></ul><h4>Medicines</h4><ul><li>NICE advises that people should continue taking their medicines (including ACE inhibitors [angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor], angiotensin receptor blockers, immunosuppressants, and diuretics) as normal, unless advised to stop by their healthcare professional. This includes people who have symptoms of COVID‑19.</li><li>For people with CKD and suspected or confirmed COVID‑19, review the use of medicines, taking into account whether any have the potential to adversely affect renal function.</li><li>Prescribe usual quantities of medicines to meet the person's clinical needs.</li></ul><h4>Monitoring CKD</h4><ul><li>NICE advises that renal function should be reassessed in people with CKD who have recovered from COVID‑19. The urgency of reassessment should be based on the person’s premorbid eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate), comorbidities, and their clinical circumstances.</li><li>For people who are stable on treatment, assess whether it is safe to reduce the frequency of routine blood and urine tests during the COVID‑19 pandemic. Take into account any comorbidities and whether their CKD is progressive.</li><li>Encourage self-monitoring and self-management (including blood pressure monitoring) for people who are able to do this. NICE advise that where possible, these people should be offered access to their medical data (including diagnosis, comorbidities, test results, treatments, and correspondence).</li><li>Ensure that people who are self-monitoring or self-managing know when they should seek help and who to contact.</li></ul><h4>Referrals to renal services</h4><ul><li>To minimize risk from COVID‑19, NICE advises that clinicians should delay referral if the clinical need is not urgent, for example, if the person has mild-to-moderate proteinuria and a stable eGFR (including people with suspected inherited kidney disease).</li><li>Continue to refer people for urgent outpatient appointments if there is a clinical need, for example, if the person has accelerated progression of CKD, which is defined as:<ul><li>A sustained decrease in GFR (glomerular filtration rate) of 25% or more and a change in GFR category within 12 months or a sustained decrease in GFR of 15 ml per minute per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> per year.</li><li>Nephrotic syndrome or very severe proteinuria (urinary albumin to creatinine ratio more than 300 mg per mmol).</li><li>A new diagnosis of GFR category G5 (GFR less than 15 ml per minute per 1.73m<sup>2</sup>).</li></ul></li><li>Clinicians should contact their local renal specialist team if there is uncertainty about the need for an urgent outpatient referral.</li></ul><h4>Renal ultrasound</h4><ul><li>To minimize risk from COVID‑19, NICE advises delaying referral for renal ultrasound if the result is unlikely to change management immediately, for example, if the person has:<ul><li>A family history of polycystic kidney disease and needs renal ultrasound to exclude this disease.</li><li>A GFR less than 30 ml per minute per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> (GFR category G4 or G5) that has been stable for at least 6 months.</li><li>Been identified by a nephrologist as having a possible need for a non‑urgent renal biopsy.</li></ul></li><li>Continue to refer people for renal ultrasound if the result might immediately change management, for example, if the person has:<ul><li>Accelerated progression of
