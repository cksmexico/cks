defined as signs and symptoms of infection from 4–12 weeks.</li><li><strong>Post-COVID-19 syndrome</strong> is defined as signs and symptoms of infection consistent with COVID-19 lasting longer than 12 weeks.</li><li><strong>Long COVID</strong> is defined as signs and symptoms persisting after the first 4 weeks, so encompasses both ongoing symptomatic and post-COVID-19 syndrome.</li></ul><h4>Symptoms</h4><ul><li>Symptoms after acute COVID-19 are variable and wide ranging.

A shared decision-making approach should be used to inform follow up and review, particularly if symptoms of COVID-19 persist beyond 4 weeks of the initial presentation. </li></ul><h4>Urgent referral</h4><ul><li>Refer people with ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 or suspected post-COVID-19 syndrome urgently if they have signs or symptoms that could be caused by an acute or life‑threatening complication, including:<ul><li>Severe hypoxaemia or oxygen desaturation on exercise.</li><li>Signs of severe lung disease.</li><li>Cardiac chest pain.</li><li>Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (in children).</li><li>Severe psychiatric symptoms or at risk of self-harm or suicide.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Other specialist referral</h4><ul><li>For people who do not need urgent referral consider referral to the appropriate local services for people who:<ul><li>Have anxiety, depression, or more complex psychological needs (or complex physical and mental health presentations).</li><li>May benefit from a multidisciplinary assessment service.</li><li>May benefit from specialist care for specific complications.</li></ul></li><li>Note that you should not exclude referrals for further specialist input based on the absence of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. </li></ul><h4>Management and self-management</h4><ul><li class=\"MsoNormal\">Give advice and information on self-management to people with ongoing symptomatic COVID‑19 or post‑COVID‑19 syndrome including:<ul><li class=\"MsoNormal\">Ways to self-manage their symptoms, such as setting realistic goals.</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\">Who to contact if they are worried about their symptoms or need support with self‑management.</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\">Sources of advice and support, including support groups and social prescribing.</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\">Signposting support from other services, including advice on social care, housing, and employment, and financial support.</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\">Information about new or continuing symptoms of COVID-19.</li></ul></li><li class=\"MsoNormal\">Explain to people there is no evidence for over-the-counter vitamins or supplements for the treatment of new or ongoing symptoms of COVID‑19.</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\">Support people in discussions with their employer, school, or college about returning to work or education, for example by having a phased return. </li></ul><h4>Follow up</h4><ul><li class=\"MsoNormal\">Agree with the person how often follow up is needed, and which healthcare professionals should be involved. </li><li class=\"MsoNormal\">Tailor follow up to people's symptoms and discuss any changes, including new or worsening symptoms and the effects of these on the person's life and wellbeing.</li><li class=\"MsoNormal\">Consider supported self-monitoring at home, for example heart rate, blood pressure, and pulse oximetry, if this is appropriate as part of the person's assessment.
