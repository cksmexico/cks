--><h4>General advice</h4><ul><li>When managing a person who is in the palliative or terminal phase of their illness with COVID‑19 like symptoms, take into account:<ul><li>That not all people with these symptoms will have COVID‑19.</li><li>The person's underlying health conditions, severity of the acute illness, and if they are taking multiple medicines.</li><li>That older people with comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, have a higher risk of deteriorating and may need additional monitoring or more intensive management, including hospital admission, if this is appropriate to their phase of illness.</li><li>That patients with severe symptoms of COVID‑19 may deteriorate rapidly and need further assessment if this is appropriate to their phase of illness.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Symptom control</h4><p>There are separate CKS topics on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-cough/\">Palliative care - cough</a>, <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/palliative-care-dyspnoea/\">Palliative care - dyspnoea</a>, and <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/delirium/\">Delirium</a>, please see these topics for more information.</p><ul><li>Fever<ul><li>Be aware that, on average, the fever associated with COVID-19 is most common 5 days after exposure to the virus.</li><li>If you suspect that the person has COVID-19 advise them to drink fluids regularly to avoid dehydration (no more than 2 litres per day).</li><li>Do not use antipyretics with the sole aim of reducing body temperature.</li><li>Advise people to take paracetamol if they have fever and other symptoms that antipyretics would help treat. </li><li>Tell them to continue only while the fever and the other symptoms are present. </li><li>National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) suggests that until there is more evidence, paracetamol is preferred to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for people with COVID‑19. </li></ul></li></ul><h4>Anticipatory prescribing</h4><ul><li>When prescribing and supplying anticipatory medicines at the end of life:<ul><li>Take into account potential waste, medicines shortages, and lack of administration equipment by prescribing smaller quantities or by prescribing a different medicine, formulation or route of administration when appropriate.</li><li>If there are fewer health and care staff you may need to prescribe subcutaneous, rectal or long-acting formulations, and carers or family members may need to administer them.</li><li>Consider different routes for administering medicines if the patient is unable to take or tolerate oral medicines, such as sublingual or rectal routes, or subcutaneous injections.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 2b4a4f1f-cbac-4114-9e8f-aba500eaa875 --><!-- end item 942e2ca7-0e67-4108-a8c4-aba500eaa875
