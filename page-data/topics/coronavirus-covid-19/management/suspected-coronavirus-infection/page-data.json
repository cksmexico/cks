Individuals with mild symptoms (fever and/or continuous cough) are advised to stay at home. </li></ul><h4>Symptomatic people</h4><p>People with symptoms of COVID-19 should self-isolate and arrange for a swab test by booking it <a href=\"https://self-referral.test-for-coronavirus.service.gov.uk/antigen/condition\" data-hyperlink-id=\"083b27f7-4247-486a-b2ac-ac6700b656f4\">online</a>, or if this is not possible, call the following telephone numbers:</p><ul><li>119 in England, Wales or Northern Ireland.</li><li>0300 303 2713 in Scotland.</li></ul><p>If people are unable to self-care, have severe symptoms, or are immunosuppressed the advice is to contact NHS 111 online for telephone assessment. Public Health England (PHE) has advised that the following criteria should be applied to the decision to admit a person to hospital:</p><ul><li>A hospital practitioner has decided that admission to hospital is required with an expectation that the patient will need to stay at least 1 night <strong><em>and</em></strong></li><li>Have either clinical or radiological evidence of pneumonia <em><strong>or</strong></em></li><li>Acute respiratory distress syndrome <em><strong>or</strong></em></li><li>Influenza-like illness (fever ≥37.8°C and at least one of the following respiratory symptoms, which must be of acute onset: persistent cough [with or without sputum], hoarseness, nasal discharge or congestion, shortness of breath, sore throat, wheezing, sneezing).</li></ul><h4>Isolation advice</h4><p>PHE recommends that if people have symptoms of coronavirus, they need to stay at home and self-isolate for 10 days after symptoms started. </p><p>People can stop self-isolating after 10 days:</p><ul><li>If they do not have any symptoms.</li><li>If they only have a cough or changes to sense of smell or taste, as these can last for weeks after the infection. </li></ul><p>People should continue to self-isolate after 10 days if they have and of the following symptoms:</p><ul><li>A high temperature, or feel hot and shivery.</li><li>A runny nose or sneezing.</li><li>Nausea or vomiting.</li><li>Diarrhoea.</li></ul><p>If a person lives with someone who has symptoms or has tested positive, the advice is to self-isolate for 14 days (this is because it can take 14 days for symptoms to appear).</p><ul><li>The 14 days start from:<ul><li>When the first person in the home started to have symptoms.</li><li>The day they were tested if they have not had symptoms — if they get symptoms after they were tested, self-isolate for a further 14 days from when the symptoms started.</li></ul></li><li>If the person is completely asymptomatic, they can stop self-isolating after 14 days.</li></ul><p>If a person develops symptoms while self-isolating they should book a test and keep self-isolating for the remainder of the 14 days.</p><ul><li>If the test is positive they should self-isolate for 10 days from when the symptoms started — this may mean they self-isolate for longer than 14 days.</li></ul><h4>For people who may have been in contact with someone with coronavirus infection</h4><ul><li>People who have been told to self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace or the NHS COVID-19 app should self-isolate for 14 days from the day they were last in contact with the person who tested positive for coronavirus.</li></ul><!-- end field 75bddf11-8492-4379-a521-ab8700c423a1 --><!-- end item 7c9cab93-8817-416e-8fca-ab8700c423a1
