a history</h4><ul><li>CKS recommends taking a detailed history to assess the condition and to exclude differential diagnoses, such as bacterial vaginosis and sexually transmitted infections

href=\"/topics/candida-female-genital/references/\">BASHH, 2007b</a>], the CDC guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\"

</h4><ul><li>Expert opinion in the joint guidelines is that routine examination is not required in women whose history suggests acute, uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis<br>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-female-genital/references/\">FSRH, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\"

bacterial vaginosis (as clinically indicated) without examination, provided the risk of STI is low and there are no symptoms indicative of upper urinary tract infection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-female-genital/references/\">Fahami, 2013</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in the BASHH <em>Guidelines on the management of vulvovaginal candidiasis</em> is that vulvovaginal candidiasis is often diagnosed on the basis of clinical features alone [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-female-genital/references/\">BASHH, 2007b</a>], and the CDC guideline states that a diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis is suggested clinically by the presence of symptoms (external dysuria and vulvar pruritus, pain, swelling, and redness) and signs (vulvar oedema, fissures, excoriations, and thick curdy vaginal discharge) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-female-genital/references/\">CDC, 2015</a>].</li><li>The signs of vulvovaginal candidiasis are based on expert opinion in the  BASHH <em>Guidelines on the management of vulvovaginal candidiasis</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-female-genital/references/\">BASHH, 2007b</a>], the CDC guideline [<a

2013</a>].</li></ul><h4>Investigations not routinely recommended</h4><ul><li>A syndromic approach (treatment without tests) for women with uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis is suggested in the joint guidelines [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-female-genital/references/\">FSRH, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-female-genital/references/\">RCGP, 2013</a>].</li><li>Guidelines differ in their recommendations for point-of-care and laboratory tests for women with suspected vulvovaginal candidiasis: The joint FSRH and BASHH guideline does not recommend routinely investigating vaginal secretions (pH, fungal microscopy, culture), neither does it suggest always examining a woman if the history suggests uncomplicated candidal vulvovaginitis. However, if an examination is done, it recommends a vaginal pH test using narrow-range pH paper, as the result can be used to assess the likelihood of <em>Candida</em> infection [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-female-genital/references/\">FSRH, 2012</a>].  <ul><li>The BASHH guidelines <em>Sexually transmitted infections: UK national screening and testing guideline</em> and <em>National guideline on the management of vulvovaginal candidiasis</em> recommend fungal microscopy and culture in symptomatic women whenever possible, stating that treatment on the basis of symptoms alone leads to over-treatment in a large number of women [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-female-genital/references/\">BASHH, 2006a</a>].</li><li>The CDC recommends [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-female-genital/references/\">CDC, 2015</a>]:<ul><li>For women with suspected uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis, testing vaginal pH and doing fungal microscopy and culture of vaginal secretions. However, if <em>Candida</em> cultures cannot be performed in these women, empirical treatment can be considered. </li><li>For women with suspected complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis, vaginal cultures to confirm clinical diagnosis and identify unusual species.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>CKS has based these recommendations largely on the joint FSRH and BASHH guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-female-genital/references/\">FSRH, 2012</a>], which clearly distinguishes different clinical scenarios and reflects current practice in primary healthcare. <ul><li>CKS does not recommend routine fungal microscopy and culture in women with features typical of acute, uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis because this is not practical in primary care and there is no evidence of clinical benefit.</li><li>The recommendation to exclude diabetes in pre-pubertal girls and postmenopausal women is based on expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-female-genital/references/\">Nwokolo and Boag, 2000</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-female-genital/references/\">Sobel, 2003</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-female-genital/references/\">Hayes and Creighton, 2007</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-female-genital/references/\">Sobel, 2007</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-female-genital/references/\">Fischer, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/candida-female-genital/references/\">Fischer and Bradford, 2016</a>], which suggests that pre-pubertal girls and postmenopausal women rarely have vulvovaginal candidiasis without an underlying predisposing factor (such as diabetes).</li><li>The other recommended investigations are largely based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field bf8149f2-29eb-49c8-9dec-133573b0ba2d --><!-- end item 17959017-11cf-43b7-b513-b21eae54b8c4 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
