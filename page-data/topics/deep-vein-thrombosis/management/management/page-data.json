href=\"/topics/deep-vein-thrombosis/references/\">NICE, 2020</a>]:<ul><li>Interim therapeutic anticoagulation should be offered if ultrasound scan results cannot be obtained within 4 hours in people in whom deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is suspected with a <em>likely</em> Wells score, and in people with an <em>unlikely</em> Wells score if D-dimer test results cannot be obtained within 4 hours, or

treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/deep-vein-thrombosis/references/\">Streiff, 2016</a>] also suggests rivaroxaban or apixaban are suitable for the acute and short-term treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in appropriate people and this approach is supported by a primary care guideline [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/deep-vein-thrombosis/references/\">NHS Oxfordshire CCG, 2019</a>], and a primary care protocol for management of people with suspected DVT [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/deep-vein-thrombosis/references/\">Derbyshire JAPC, 2019</a>].<ul><li>Apixaban and rivaroxaban are convenient for initiation of treatment as the quick onset of action negates the need for parenteral therapy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/deep-vein-thrombosis/references/\">OUH, 2019</a>].</li><li>Dabigatran and edoxaban are also options to treat DVT, however, treatment should only be started following initial use of parenteral anticoagulation for at least 5 days [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/deep-vein-thrombosis/references/\">Joint Formulary Committee, 2019</a>]. </li><li><strong>Note:</strong> the use of apixaban or rivaroxaban in people with suspected DVT is off-label.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Referral of pregnant and postpartum women <strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/deep-vein-thrombosis/references/\">RCOG, 2015</a>]</strong></h5><ul><li>Pregnant or postpartum women with symptoms and/or signs of VTE should have objective testing performed expeditiously and should be treated with LMWH until the diagnosis is excluded by objective testing unless treatment is strongly contraindicated. It is not possible to accurately assess the risk of DVT in primary care based on the usual methods of assessment because:<ul><li>There is no evidence to support the use of pre-test probability assessment in the management of acute VTE in pregnancy. </li><li>D-dimer testing should not be performed in the investigation of acute VTE in pregnancy. </li></ul></li></ul><h5>The Wells score [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/deep-vein-thrombosis/references/\">NICE, 2020</a>]</h5><ul><li>Although there are several versions of the Wells score available, NICE recommends the two-level DVT Wells score as it is more relevant, up to date, and consistent with their latest understanding of VTE risks.</li></ul><h5>D-dimer test <strong>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/deep-vein-thrombosis/references/\">NICE, 2020</a>]</strong></h5><ul><li>The formation of thrombus is normally followed by an immediate fibrinolytic response, resulting in generation of plasmin that causes the release of fibrin degradation products (predominantly containing D-dimer) into the circulation. A negative D-dimer assay, therefore, implies that thrombosis is not occurring and thus has a role in excluding a diagnosis of DVT (along with clinical scores and imaging). Although a positive D-dimer result can indicate thrombosis, other possible causes of a raised D-dimer include liver disease, inflammation, malignancy, pregnancy, trauma, and recent surgery.<ul><li>D-dimer tests have relatively high sensitivity but low specificity (false-positive results are common). Therefore, whilst a negative D-dimer may be useful in excluding DVT, a positive D-dimer is of no diagnostic value, but merely mandates further testing.</li><li>A negative D-dimer test is good enough to exclude the diagnosis of DVT in people with an <em>unlikely </em>pre-test clinical probability, but it is not good enough to exclude the diagnosis of DVT in those with a <em>likely </em>pre-test probability.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 37ac8d9b-0739-40c6-a653-1b63e6a1717f --><!-- end item 1647f238-3ad2-4d7b-bca1-41f44ef01a78 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"381b703f-7127-502b-b17a-073b9e9a6783","slug":"follow-up-for-dvt","fullItemName":"Follow up for DVT","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 25cd7abf-f91f-415a-87d9-311ba2c2b631 --><h3>How should I follow up a person with confirmed deep vein thrombosis?</h3><!-- end field 25cd7abf-f91f-415a-87d9-311ba2c2b631 -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item 62ce5e90-d9f1-4562-b83c-d4dbcb27f66b --><!-- begin field 2e15e401-e960-43b5-a3a9-6a736bb38ce0 --><ul><li>Provided there are no contraindications (such as pregnancy or cancer), people who have been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) will require maintenance treatment with an oral anticoagulant (warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban) following acute treatment. </li><li><strong>Ensure adequate monitoring.</strong><ul><li>Specialists will make clinical decisions such as the choice of anticoagulant and the duration of treatment.</li><li>Treatment is usually continued for at least 3 months, but duration may be longer depending on whether the DVT was <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/deep-vein-thrombosis/background-information/definition/\">unprovoked</a> (no obvious, transient risk factor identified) or <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/deep-vein-thrombosis/background-information/definition/\">provoked</a> (caused by an identifiable, transient, major risk factor). </li><li>For warfarin, the usual strategy is to aim for an international normalized ratio (INR) target of 2.5, keeping within the range of 2.0–3.0. </li><li>Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) do not require any coagulation monitoring or regular dose adjustments.</li><li>For more information, see the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/anticoagulation-oral/\">Anticoagulation – oral</a>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Ensure that people with unprovoked DVT are investigated for the possibility of an undiagnosed cancer </strong>if they are not already known to have cancer (see <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/deep-vein-thrombosis/management/management/#investigations-for-cancer-thrombophilia-testing\">Investigations for cancer</a> for more information). </li><li><strong>Ensure that people with unprovoked DVT have been offered thrombophilia testing, as appropriate </strong>(see <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/deep-vein-thrombosis/management/management/#investigations-for-cancer-thrombophilia-testing\">Thrombophilia testing</a> for more information). </li><li><strong>Do not offer elastic graduated compression stockings to prevent post-thrombotic syndrome or VTE recurrence after a proximal DVT.

thromboembolism recurrence after a proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is based on the NICE guideline <em>Venous thromboembolic diseases: diagnosis, management and thrombophilia testin</em><em>g</em> [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/deep-vein-thrombosis/references/\">NICE, 2020</a>], and the American College of Chest

compared with placebo stockings for preventing post-thrombotic syndrome after proximal DVT, found that compression stockings did not prevent post-thrombotic syndrome after a first proximal DVT, and concluded that compression stockings do not alter the natural history of development of post-thrombotic syndrome after DVT [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\"

internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/deep-vein-thrombosis/references/\">Kearon, 2016</a>] states that for people with acute or chronic symptoms, a trial of graduated compression stockings is often justified, and NICE advises that its recommendation does not cover the use of elastic stockings for the management of leg symptoms after DVT [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\"
