However, the authors concluded that overall, antihistamines used alone have no clinically significant effect on symptoms of the common cold such as nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea or sneezing [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/references/\">Sutter et al, 2015</a>].</li></ul><h5>Increased fluid intake</h5><ul><li>Despite being almost universally recommended, very little evidence supports increased fluid intake in the management of common cold. A Cochrane review concluded that there is currently no evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for or against the recommendation to increase fluids in acute respiratory infections [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/references/\">Guppy et al, 2011</a>].</li><li>It is important to maintain normal hydration as fluid loss is likely to be greater when fever and nasal discharge are present.

People should remain as active as they can without feeling significant discomfort [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/references/\">BMJ, 2016</a>].</li></ul><h5>Antipyretics and Analgesics</h5><ul><li>The recommendation that paracetamol or ibuprofen should be used to treat headache, muscle pain, or fever is based on anecdotal evidence and expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/references/\">Arroll, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/references/\">Allan, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/references/\">BMJ, 2016</a>], and it is consistent with NICE and ICSI [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/references/\">NICE, 2008</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/references/\">NICE, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/references/\">ICSI, 2013</a>].<ul><li>One systematic review of 4 randomized controlled trials (n = 758) found that paracetamol may help relieve nasal obstruction and rhinorrhoea, but does not appear to improve other cold symptoms in adults (including sore throat, malaise, sneezing, and cough) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/references/\">Li et al, 2013</a>]. </li><li>One systematic review (n = 1069) of children and adults from the USA, Japan, Belgium, and Denmark found that NSAIDs may improve headache, ear pain, and muscle and joint pain, but there is no clear evidence that NSAIDs are effective in improving cough and rhinorrhoea [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/references/\">Kim et al, 2013</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Preventing spread of infection</h5><ul><li>The recommendation on preventing spread of infection is based on expert opinion in the guideline published by the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement, which has extrapolated from the known mechanisms of transmission of viruses implicated in the cold [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/references/\">ICSI, 2013</a>]; and expert opinion in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) Best practice review <em>Common cold</em>, and in review articles on the management of the common cold [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/references/\">Turner and Hendley, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/references/\">Fashner et al, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/references/\">Allan, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/references/\">Passioti et al, 2014</a>].<ul><li>A major route of transmission of viruses involved in the common cold is direct bodily contact.

A Cochrane systematic review identified six randomized controlled trials (n = 394) and found that steam inhalation led to symptom relief in the common cold. However, the authors concluded that steam inhalation has not shown enough consistent benefit to make a clear recommendation for its use in treating the common cold, and they warned of the dangers of steam inhalation, in particular scalding in young children [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/references/\">Singh and Singh, 2013</a>].</li><li><strong>Vapour rubs. </strong>Evidence for their efficacy in the common cold is lacking, although parent surveys have rated vapour rub favourably when compared to petrolatum and no treatment for the symptomatic relief of their child's nocturnal cough, congestion, and sleep difficulty caused by upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/references/\">Paul et al, 2010</a>].</li><li><strong>Gargling with salt water </strong>has not been shown to be effective in any study, but there are anecdotal reports that it may soothe a sore throat, and it is unlikely to be harmful.</li><li><strong>Menthol lozenges </strong>have little effect on nasal congestion using objective measurements, but they may create the sensation of improved airflow and therefore create a subjective improvement [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/references/\">Eccles et al, 1990</a>].</li><li><strong>Saline nasal drops </strong>are thought to facilitate mucus drainage from the nose [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/references/\">MHRA, 2009</a>].  A Cochrane systematic review (search date: August 2014) identified five RCTs that randomized 544 children (three studies) and 205 adults (exclusively from two studies). One of the larger trials of children showed a significant reduction in nasal secretion and nasal breathing (obstruction) in the saline group. The authors concluded that nasal saline irrigation possibly has benefits for relieving the symptoms of acute URTIs, although the included trials were generally small with a risk of bias [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/references/\">King et al, 2015</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 6acc0535-d9e8-4782-9af0-9fcc40457c50 --><!-- end item d0b5ec2e-2834-43e6-b7ee-32170fa055d5 -->","subChapters":[]}]},{"id":"0afb1165-a3ae-5383-b034-c768e455f286","slug":"follow-up","fullItemName":"Follow-up","depth":3,"htmlHeader":"<!-- begin field 934d872a-3818-4d7b-a1dc-a21456e67e1c --><h3>When should I follow-up people with the common cold?</h3><!-- end field 934d872a-3818-4d7b-a1dc-a21456e67e1c -->","summary":null,"htmlStringContent":"<!-- begin item e59e2c8c-a8ee-4109-af82-e6e310f43120 --><!-- begin field bcbada71-5593-42ea-bf3f-a37ac593a265 --><ul><li><strong>Advise that a follow-up appointment is needed if:</strong><ul><li>Symptoms are worsening (for example after 3–5 days).</li><li>Symptoms are persisting (for example after 7–14 days).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Consider advising an earlier review for:</strong><ul><li>People with risk factors for<strong> </strong><a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/common-cold/background-information/complications/\">complications</a>.</li><li>Young children and babies — advise parents or carers to return if their child develops dehydration, laboured breathing, or prolonged fever.
