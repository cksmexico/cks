No known treatment improves the time course of infection.</li><li>Rhinovirus is the most common cause of the common cold.</li><li>The mechanism of transmission of the common cold is usually by either direct contact, or aerosol transmission. People can remain infectious (shedding the virus) for several weeks.</li><li>Adults experience an average of 2–3 colds a year. Young children attending primary school or preschool have an average of 5–8 colds a year.</li><li>The most common complications are sinusitis, lower respiratory tract infections, and acute otitis media.</li><li>The onset of symptoms after infection is sudden, reaching a peak at day 2–3, then decreasing in intensity. In adults and older children, symptoms tend to last about a week although cough can persist for up to 3 weeks. In younger children, symptoms typically last 10–14 days.</li><li>Smokers tend to have more severe respiratory symptoms (including cough), and the infection is more prolonged.</li><li>Diagnosis is based on the presentation of clinical features and the person should be examined to exclude a complication or alternative diagnosis.</li><li>Commonly symptoms or signs in adults and older children include:<ul><li>Sore or irritated throat.</li><li>Nasal irritation, congestion, nasal discharge (rhinorrhoea), and sneezing.

People should be advised that:<ul><li>Antibiotics and antihistamines are ineffective and may cause adverse effects.</li><li>Adequate fluids should be taken.</li><li>Healthy food is recommended.</li><li>Adequate rest is advised. Normal activity will not prolong illness.</li></ul></li><li>The person or carer should be advised to use paracetamol or ibuprofen if needed.

An earlier review should be considered for people with risk factors for complications.  </li></ul><!-- end field 1b11a7c6-5dae-4068-8477-f22452086b2d --><!-- end item ff763c99-30cf-4944-a3d7-bec1512c3334 -->","topic":{"id":"9b78695c-3c64-5770-bf35-1ee5cf2cb29f","topicId":"5aee85d5-d8d1-479b-bfa3-a30835b97d6e","topicName":"Common cold","slug":"common-cold","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"2d71e136-2d58-5131-b317-e17dfa10407a","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"68f3d785-7f34-53dc-8693-fac9f8cf0b83","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"80ffc4ec-68ee-5b3c-85de-9b0b2c0727cd","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"13da7724-388f-5083-87a4-d197fad621d3","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"f8e94edd-fbab-509e-a4a6-bcaeaee3a12e","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"845c4165-0e4b-54b7-ad0d-4a3f8ce0dba1","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"58640184-7105-5c0b-ba03-9ac3c8039df6","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"b7861ff1-501e-5737-93f3-92d5e0dd1b85","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"8de0aa85-b6cc-5f52-b748-4ffd3122e588","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"8c040833-f111-5821-a361-8c6e8971d947","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"0a34aff3-ba2e-5669-b5db-838f0f362dcf","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
