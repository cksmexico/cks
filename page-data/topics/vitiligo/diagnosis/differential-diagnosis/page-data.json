It is caused by defective manufacture of melanin.</li><li>Piebaldism — an autosomal dominant condition in which there is an absence of melanocytes in affected areas of the skin. It usually presents at birth with a white forelock of hair, anterior body midline depigmentation, and bilateral shin depigmentation. The patches remain unchanged throughout life.</li><li>Tuberous sclerosis — an inherited disease, characterized by ash-leaf shaped, depigmented macules on the trunk. It usually presents in early childhood, and other skin features include facial angiofibromas or periungual fibromas.</li><li>Incontentia pigmenti achromians of Ito (hypomelanosis of Ito) — characterized by depigmented whorls on the legs or trunk, usually in babies or small children. There may be associated disorders of the musculoskeletal system, eyes, teeth, and central nervous system.</li><li>Naevus anaemicus — a congenital disorder causing hypopigmented patches due to localized vasoconstriction.</li><li>Naevus depigmentosus — segmental hypopigmentation that is usually present at birth or in the first year of life, lesions may increase in size in proportion to the growth of the child.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Post-inflammatory</strong><ul><li>Chemical/occupational depigmentation — for example caused by phenolic/catecholic derivatives that are cytotoxic to melanocytes. Sources include adhesives, de-emulsifiers used in oil fields, deodorants, disinfectants, duplicating paper, formaldehyde resins, germicidal detergents, hair dyes, insecticides, latex gloves, motor oil additives, paints, photographic chemicals, plasticizers, printing ink, rubber antioxidants, soap antioxidants, synthetic oils, varnish, and lacquer resins.</li><li>Hypopigmentation following any inflammatory skin condition, including eczema, psoriasis, lichen planus, scleroderma or systemic sclerosis, lupus erythematosus, and syphilis. It can be distinguished from vitiligo by being hypopigmented rather than depigmented.</li><li>Morphoea — a localized thickening of the dermis due to excess collagen. It is most common in women aged 20–40 years.</li><li>Lichen sclerosis — characterized by itchy, white atrophic plaques in the perineum, which may mimic mucosal vitiligo.</li><li>Pityriasis alba — variously defined as either a form of eczema or a form of post-inflammatory hypopigmentation following mild eczema. It is relatively common in children with darker skin, in whom multiple, poorly defined, hypopigmented, non-scaly, round to oval patches with ill-defined borders are seen on the face, neck, and trunk. In people with paler skin, it may only be visible in the summer when the normal skin tans.</li><li>Post-traumatic leukoderma — may occur after deep burns or scars.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Infective</strong><ul><li>Progressive macular hypomelanosis — a common disorder in people of African or Afro-Caribbean origin characterized by ill-defined macules on the trunk, often confluent in and around the midline, and rarely extending to the proximal extremities, head, or neck.</li><li>Pityriasis versicolor (or tinea versicolor) — a superficial yeast infection that can cause loss of pigment, particularly in young adults with darker skin. It presents as small (less than 1 cm in diameter), round, pale hypopigmented or pink macules, which have a fine, dry surface scale. They are usually found on the neck, upper trunk and chest, abdomen, and proximal extremities. See the CKS topic on <a class=\"topic-reference external-reference\" href=\"/topics/pityriasis-versicolor/\">Pityriasis versicolor</a> for more information.</li><li>Tuberculoid leprosy — can cause hypopigmented patches (usually one to five patches) with a raised red-copper coloured border. The patches can be distinguished from vitiligo in having reduced sensation to touch, and there are usually other features such as enlarged cutaneous nerves.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Neoplastic</strong><ul><li>Melanoma-associated depigmentation — occasionally, a halo of depigmentation is seen around a malignant melanoma. It differs from that seen in a benign halo naevus by being irregular and asymmetrical.</li><li>Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides) — usually seen on the trunk and proximal extremities, especially the buttocks and pelvic girdle, and can present as scaly or non-scaly dry, hypopigmented round patches, with the skin having a typically 'wrinkled' appearance.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Other</strong><ul><li>Drug-induced depigmentation — for example due to corticosteroids, chloroquine, fluphenazine, physostigmine, and imiquimod.</li><li>Idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis — a common condition characterized by multiple, discrete, circumscribed, porcelain-white macules distributed symmetrically on the trunk, arms, and legs. Lesions tend to favour sun-exposed sites.</li><li>Halo naevus — a mole with a regular, symmetrical halo of depigmentation around it. It is caused by an immunological reaction against melanocytes and, eventually, the mole disappears. They are benign, common in children, and occur more often (compared with the general population) in people who also have vitiligo.</li><li>Sarcoidosis — hypopigmented macules may occur over granulomas in the dermis or subcutaneous tissue.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 33d18b01-547b-4856-8d20-f2accdc2091e --><!-- end item bb3b71de-ea09-4ce3-bf9b-5c56f2d603d5 -->","topic":{"id":"72501cc1-fbf6-5c3a-bfc1-1a2d865f7dff","topicId":"85a32b0f-cf7a-41c9-9dd8-caed21004663","topicName":"Vitiligo","slug":"vitiligo","lastRevised":"Last revised in April 2020","chapters":[{"id":"237f05d1-6751-5abf-98b0-af49db55e1b3","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"e51e2938-3e89-53a6-9251-b0376a90be4d","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"5c590af0-29e5-5be3-958d-02f67350d529","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"aee2331c-c78c-5c0d-ba9a-c974cfb039ae","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"8afc6e46-c250-5eb3-85a1-355d3e18ee65","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"78bbc5cd-9e73-55fb-b421-d718417be14a","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"1a4f8e76-7634-54ba-8849-3051a448dccc","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"65dbcf54-b53e-54e8-a2fe-a07b8aae49f2","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"ba868062-b333-5694-90cb-1b24ed0d9c11","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"1912341a-6cf7-5d2a-b20d-cb4f55308c36","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"05992da2-cc78-5880-8307-5a5f8e4cc4da","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
