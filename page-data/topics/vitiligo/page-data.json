It is classified into two subtypes of non-segmental vitiligo (or 'vitiligo' used as an umbrella term) and segmental vitiligo, according to its distribution and extent.<ul><li>Depigmented skin macules and patches can appear anywhere, but most commonly affect the fingers and wrists, axillae, groin and genitalia, and the skin around the eyes and mouth.</li></ul></li><li>Non-segmental vitiligo is the more common form. It has a non-dermatomal distribution, is usually generalized and symmetrical, and may be divided into:<ul><li>Generalized (bilateral, often symmetrical, depigmented macules or patches occurring in a random distribution over the entire body surface. It often affects areas that tend to experience pressure, friction, and/or trauma).</li><li>Focal (small, isolated, depigmented lesion without an obvious segmental distribution pattern).</li><li>Acrofacial (depigmented macules limited to the distal extremities and/or the face, particularly around the orifices).</li><li>Mucosal (located on the oral and/or genital mucosa).</li><li>Universal (complete or nearly complete depigmentation of the skin, usually preceded by generalized vitiligo).</li><li>Follicular (depigmented body hairs).</li><li>Mixed (where segmental and non-segmental forms co-exist).</li><li>Unclassified (isolated mucosal involvement and persistent focal vitiligo).</li></ul></li><li>Segmental vitiligo is less common, and typically has an earlier age of onset.<ul><li>It usually has a dermatomal distribution, affecting part or all of a single dermatome, and is typically unilateral and limited to one segment. More rarely, it may affect several segments or larger areas.</li></ul></li><li>The exact pathogenetic mechanism of vitiligo is unknown. Triggers may include stress, skin trauma (Koebner phenomenon), and exposure to chemicals.</li><li>Risk factors include a family history of vitiligo, and personal or family history of other autoimmune diseases, such as thyroid disease.</li><li>The prognosis depends on the person's age, disease subtype, distribution, activity, and extent. For most people, the likelihood of spontaneous repigmentation is low.</li><li>Assessment of a person with suspected vitiligo should include:<ul><li>Asking about extent, duration, and spread of lesions; the impact on quality of life; triggers and risk factors; and previous episodes and treatments.</li><li>Examining the skin lesions to determine the subtype of disease, assessing skin type, and estimating the body surface area affected.</li><li>Considering blood tests for co-morbid autoimmune disease, such as thyroid function tests and thyroid autoantibodies, if non-segmental disease is suspected.</li></ul></li><li>Management of a person with suspected vitiligo should include:<ul><li>Providing advice on sources of information and support.</li><li>Advising on sun protection.</li><li>Managing any psychosocial co-morbidities.</li><li>Offering short-term potent topical corticosteroid treatment to adults with non-facial localized, non-segmental disease if there are no contraindications.</li><li>Arranging regular review to assess treatment response and monitor for adverse effects.</li><li>Arranging further investigation or referral for associated autoimmune disease, if appropriate.</li><li>Arranging referral to a dermatologist for specialist management if the diagnosis is uncertain, or treatment in primary care is inappropriate or unsuccessful.</li><li>Offering referral to a skin camouflage service, if appropriate.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field f45af5b1-ec85-4312-8d66-603b812b98ed --><!-- end item e43925e6-ed19-473d-8117-e1fa9d037d9e -->","topic":{"id":"72501cc1-fbf6-5c3a-bfc1-1a2d865f7dff","topicId":"85a32b0f-cf7a-41c9-9dd8-caed21004663","topicName":"Vitiligo","slug":"vitiligo","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"237f05d1-6751-5abf-98b0-af49db55e1b3","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"e51e2938-3e89-53a6-9251-b0376a90be4d","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"5c590af0-29e5-5be3-958d-02f67350d529","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"aee2331c-c78c-5c0d-ba9a-c974cfb039ae","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"8afc6e46-c250-5eb3-85a1-355d3e18ee65","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"78bbc5cd-9e73-55fb-b421-d718417be14a","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"1a4f8e76-7634-54ba-8849-3051a448dccc","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"65dbcf54-b53e-54e8-a2fe-a07b8aae49f2","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"ba868062-b333-5694-90cb-1b24ed0d9c11","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"1912341a-6cf7-5d2a-b20d-cb4f55308c36","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"05992da2-cc78-5880-8307-5a5f8e4cc4da","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
