In addition, parents of children with vitiligo should be offered psychological counselling [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Gawkrodger, 2008</a>].</li><li>Expert opinion in a review article notes that psychotherapy including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and hypnosis has been described to improve quality of life, reduce anxiety, improve coping mechanisms, and possibly enhance repigmentation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Ezzedine, 2016</a>]. This approach is supported by expert opinion in additional review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Ezzedine, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Bergqvist, 2020</a>].</li></ul><h5>Offering the option of no treatment</h5><ul><li>The recommendation to offer no treatment if clinically appropriate is based on the BAD guideline publication, which notes that in children and adults with skin types I and II, the initial approach may be to use no active treatment other than camouflage cosmetics and sunscreens [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Gawkrodger, 2008</a>]. This approach is supported by the European Dermatology Forum consensus document [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Taieb, 2013</a>]. In addition, expert opinion in a review article states that the risks of treatment may outweigh benefits if there is localized disease in children with lightly pigmented skin [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Ezzedine, 2016</a>].</li></ul><h5>Prescribing a potent topical corticosteroid</h5><ul><li>CKS notes the lack of a consensus opinion in the literature as to the optimal duration and regimen of topical corticosteroid use for vitiligo.<ul><li>The BAD guideline publication states that topical corticosteroids are the usual first‐line treatment for people with vitiligo [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Gawkrodger, 2008</a>].<ul><li>It advises that in adults with recent-onset vitiligo, treatment with a potent or very potent topical corticosteroid should be considered for a trial period of no more than 2 months, owing to the risk of adverse effects with prolonged use.</li><li>Although there is evidence that very potent or potent topical corticosteroids can repigment vitiligo in adults, it notes the supporting studies have often been poorly conducted, and adverse effects are common if treatment lasts for more than a few weeks.</li></ul></li><li>The European Dermatology Forum consensus document similarly notes that topical corticosteroids are widely used as first-line treatment for limited forms of vitiligo owing to their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Taieb, 2013</a>].<ul><li>It recommends once-daily application of potent topical corticosteroids for people with limited, extra-facial involvement for a period of up to 3 months if used continuously. It also suggests the option of intermittent use (such as 15 days per month for 6 months).</li><li>It states that potent topical corticosteroids appear to be at least as effective as very potent preparations.</li></ul></li><li>A Cochrane systematic review of six small randomized controlled trials (randomized controlled trials, n = 363) reported repigmentation in more than 75% of people, which suggests that potent or very potent topical corticosteroids used for 2–9 months are effective in people with non-segmental vitiligo [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Whitton, 2015</a>].<ul><li>However, it found no randomized controlled trials that compared topical corticosteroids with placebo, and no studies included people with segmental vitiligo.</li><li>The authors concluded that owing to the heterogeneity in the design of trials and the small numbers of participants, no firm clinical recommendations could be made.</li></ul></li><li>Expert opinion in a review article recommends the use of topical corticosteroids once daily for 6–8 weeks followed by a treatment-free interval of several weeks. It notes that intermittent therapy (3 weeks on and 1 week off or a regimen of use for 5 days a week) has also been proposed [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Passeron, 2017</a>]. Similarly, an additional review article notes there are no studies evaluating the optimal duration of treatment with topical corticosteroids. Some authors suggest its application on a daily basis for 2–3 months, while others suggest an intermittent regimen (such as once-daily application for 15 days per month for 6 months) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Bergqvist, 2020</a>].</li><li>The information that topical corticosteroid treatment is off-label for the treatment of vitiligo is based on expert opinion in the British National Formulary (BNF) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Joint Formulary Committee, 2020</a>].</li><li>The recommendations on follow up in primary care have been extrapolated from the BAD guideline publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Gawkrodger, 2008</a>] and are pragmatic, based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice. They are also supported by the expert opinion of previous external reviewers of this CKS topic.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>Arranging referral to a dermatologist</h5><ul><li>The recommendations on when to arrange specialist referral are based on the BAD guideline publication [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Gawkrodger, 2008</a>], are extrapolated from the European Dermatology Forum consensus document [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Taieb, 2013</a>], and are based on expert opinion in review articles [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Gawkrodger, 2010</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Hill, 2017</a>]. They are also pragmatic based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li><li>The recommendation to consider seeking specialist advice on treatment options whilst awaiting specialist assessment is based on the fact that for some people who are unable to use or tolerate topical corticosteroids, alternative treatments such as topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus or pimecrolimus) may be more appropriate, which are more expensive but have a better adverse effect profile [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Gawkrodger, 2008</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Taieb, 2013</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Ezzedine, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Bergqvist, 2020</a>].
