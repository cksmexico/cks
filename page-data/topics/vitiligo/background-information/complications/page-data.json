Effects may be exacerbated by the chronic, unpredictable nature of the disease [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Taieb, 2013</a>].<ul><li>A meta-analysis of 29 studies of people affected by vitiligo (n = 2530) found the pooled prevalence for depression and anxiety using validated questionnaires was 0.29 and 0.33, respectively, and these were the two most commonly reported psychological outcomes. The prevalence rates were lower when diagnosed clinically by a psychiatrist. High heterogeneity was observed between studies, which may limit their generalizability to the wider population [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Osinubi, 2017</a>].</li><li>A meta-analysis of 13 hospital-based studies of people with vitiligo (n = 1799) compared with healthy controls or people with other skin conditions found reduced quality of life scores in people with vitiligo compared with healthy controls; however, the meta-analysis was limited by high heterogeneity because of methodological and clinical differences between the studies. It also notes that specific subgroups of people with vitiligo are more likely to have reduced quality of life, such as those with darker skin or from south Asia [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Morrison, 2017</a>].</li><li>A meta-analysis of 25 observational studies (n = 2708) of people with vitiligo found the pooled odds ratio of depression compared with controls was 5.05.

The evidence in the literature is, however, conflicting.<ul><li>A meta-analysis of four variable-quality observational studies of the risk of skin cancer in people with vitiligo compared with people without vitiligo found a significantly lower risk of NMSC (crude odds ratio [OR] was 0.29) in people with vitiligo (n = 11,447), and a non-significantly lower risk for melanoma (crude OR was 0.52) in people with vitiligo (n = 11,366). The authors noted, however, the small number of studies and high heterogeneity due to differences in methodology, for example [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/vitiligo/references/\">Ban, 2018</a>].</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 3162998c-f801-4375-81c8-43546428995f --><!-- end item 4816bd84-5397-4883-9da5-43e3d5522c1a -->","topic":{"id":"72501cc1-fbf6-5c3a-bfc1-1a2d865f7dff","topicId":"85a32b0f-cf7a-41c9-9dd8-caed21004663","topicName":"Vitiligo","slug":"vitiligo","lastRevised":"Last revised in April 2020","chapters":[{"id":"237f05d1-6751-5abf-98b0-af49db55e1b3","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"e51e2938-3e89-53a6-9251-b0376a90be4d","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"5c590af0-29e5-5be3-958d-02f67350d529","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"aee2331c-c78c-5c0d-ba9a-c974cfb039ae","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"8afc6e46-c250-5eb3-85a1-355d3e18ee65","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"78bbc5cd-9e73-55fb-b421-d718417be14a","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"1a4f8e76-7634-54ba-8849-3051a448dccc","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"65dbcf54-b53e-54e8-a2fe-a07b8aae49f2","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"ba868062-b333-5694-90cb-1b24ed0d9c11","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"1912341a-6cf7-5d2a-b20d-cb4f55308c36","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"05992da2-cc78-5880-8307-5a5f8e4cc4da","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP - Options for local implementation"},{"id":"30dc5858-bfd0-5918-b331-9067d9743f12","slug":"nice-quality-standards","fullItemName":"NICE quality standards"}]},{"id":"33d1fc44-e925-5b20-982d-7e60d75465ea","fullItemName":"Background information","slug":"background-information","subChapters":[{"id":"c23ed46f-6f85-51ef-9f34-aea63f9aea9e","slug":"definition","fullItemName":"Definition"},{"id":"cfca1785-6f25-546b-8fba-a9bb5ec8bc4f","slug":"prevalence","fullItemName":"Prevalence"},{"id":"1c68db6d-01f9-5407-b229-ad9ba72d53b1","slug":"causes","fullItemName":"Causes"},{"id":"def00a0c-fcf5-5066-b8b6-d4197121b345","slug":"risk-factors","fullItemName":"Risk factors"},{"id":"4b6c885f-0d2d-5b2c-abeb-495372e63081","slug":"complications","fullItemName":"Complications"},{"id":"63ac95a4-7b80-5aef-bf7b-cc1b8b812a1c","slug":"prognosis","fullItemName":"Prognosis"}]},{"id":"9b1dd44e-152a-5b47-8bbd-a07a6000032f","fullItemName":"Diagnosis","slug":"diagnosis","subChapters":[{"id":"465324e6-d6e2-5263-8c5d-9368e36b2d89","slug":"diagnosis","fullItemName":"Diagnosis"},{"id":"ebc547bc-2b3a-55f8-a703-fff4f5d4f309","slug":"assessment","fullItemName":"Assessment"},{"id":"dea3c9af-e347-5a61-8a6e-852afbca1f6b","slug":"differential-diagnosis","fullItemName":"Differential diagnosis"}]},{"id":"674a723c-f8af-5b44-b6fc-6d46ad281431","fullItemName":"Management","slug":"management","subChapters":[{"id":"d85da703-7350-5165-a4eb-3697e45db487","slug":"management","fullItemName":"Scenario: Management"}]},{"id":"8ddf3c8a-0168-521b-a940-e841ebe05935","fullItemName":"Supporting evidence","slug":"supporting-evidence","subChapters":[]},{"id":"0f441642-e226-5709-89d2-b4f6eeee7a85","fullItemName":"How this topic was developed","slug":"how-this-topic-was-developed","subChapters":[{"id":"d538aa6d-327c-503c-b574-69a24bbfd9f0","slug":"search-strategy","fullItemName":"Search strategy"},{"id":"c5bed09a-eccb-5abe-8ff1-63f178d8c28c","slug":"stakeholder-engagement","fullItemName":"Stakeholder engagement"},{"id":"f56b39ed-360e-5ae6-9103-c21bb5e9862d","slug":"evidence-exclusion-criteria","fullItemName":"Evidence exclusion criteria"},{"id":"ba61933a-4f62-5bb3-988b-9749f78e6265","slug":"organizational-behavioural-financial-barriers","fullItemName":"Organizational, behavioural and financial barriers"},{"id":"31c2bb80-d9f1-5095-b859-2ad42da47934","slug":"declarations-of-interest","fullItemName":"Declarations of interest"}]},{"id":"a43f071b-fb92-55e3-a42d-348c5fd48924","fullItemName":"References","slug":"references","subChapters":[]}]},"parentChapter":{"id":"33d1fc44-e925-5b20-982d-7e60d75465ea","slug":"background-information","fullItemName":"Background information"},"subChapters":[]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
