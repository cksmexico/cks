Severity of symptoms is usually based on clinical judgement after considering the woman's perception of symptom severity, the impact of symptoms on the woman's quality of life, and the presence or absence of distress or impaiment of socioeconomic function.<ul><li>All women with PMS should be offered lifestyle advice (including advice on diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, alcohol restriction, regular sleep, stress reduction, and complementary treatments and/or dietary supplements), a simple analgesic for pain (if required), and patient information on PMS.</li><li>Women with moderate PMS symptoms should also be considered for treatment with a new-generation combined oral contraceptive pill and, if appropriate, cognitive behavioural therapy.</li><li>Women with severe PMS symptoms should be offered management for moderate PMS and be considered for treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (off-label use).</li></ul></li><li>The woman should be reviewed after 2 months (or earlier if indicated) to assess the effectiveness of the treatment. <ul><li>If primary care management fails to control symptoms satisfactorily, referral to a clinic with a specific interest in PMS (or a general gynaecology clinic if this is not available) should be considered.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 222244a7-fc35-48ae-8c45-1bebe9e428c8 --><!-- end item aa582206-a32c-445f-a4f3-204b46b27ebc -->","topic":{"id":"668a4b93-2e2a-5933-b12a-a5f9a6837daa","topicId":"f6d48374-0ddd-481d-bd35-f505fee5c47c","topicName":"Premenstrual syndrome","slug":"premenstrual-syndrome","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"be47d0f4-3261-5657-aed1-da0bf6c8646b","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"8a1b7572-de88-506c-b0a1-1abc9c2b3400","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"6b9c9d21-76ac-5aeb-8eb1-6691f5ceeebf","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"35972086-c065-56c4-b666-e4587fdcf93f","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"1514e449-0c67-5287-89db-b28b88262141","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"77ec7d7d-940c-500d-a1ba-cfbab291e38e","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"7e8b32dc-1aa1-5788-97c8-df04afc2b0d7","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"4aaf0515-7ef4-50cd-ac12-5b17be6cd5e2","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"0acf2aa6-23e0-570b-b29e-dfdacdf474e8","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"3c135ec7-461a-543c-b44d-ee843697d5cd","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"d791fb42-e91f-59e0-8c0c-b0f37f0af9d8","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
