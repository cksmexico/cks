They fall into four subtypes:<ul><li><strong>Premenstrual exacerbation of an underlying disorder</strong> — symptoms of an underlying disorder (such as diabetes, depression, epilepsy, asthma, and migraine) significantly worsen premenstrually.</li><li><strong>Non-ovulatory PMDs</strong> — symptoms result (rarely) from ovarian activity other than ovulation. This condition is poorly understood due to lack of evidence, but it is thought that follicular activity of the ovary can cause symptoms.</li><li><strong>Progestogen-induced PMD</strong> — symptoms result from exogenous progesterone administration, for example hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or the combined oral contraceptive (COC) pill. Progestogen-only contraceptives may also cause symptoms but because they are noncyclical, these symptoms are not included within variant PMDs and are considered adverse effects (probably with similar mechanisms) of continuous progestogen therapy.</li><li><strong>PMDs with absent menstruation </strong>— symptoms arise from continued ovarian activity even though menstruation has been suppressed, for example after a hysterectomy or endometrial ablation, or in women using the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of PMS </strong>defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) as occurring when a woman suffers from at least five out of 11 distinct psychological premenstrual symptoms, one of which must include mood [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/premenstrual-syndrome/references/\">American Psychiatric Association, 2013</a>;
