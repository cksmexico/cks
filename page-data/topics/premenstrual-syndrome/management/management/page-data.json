Specific recommendations on what to advise are based on expert opinion in a practice bulletin from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/premenstrual-syndrome/references/\">ACOG, 2001</a>] and on what CKS considered to be good clinical practice. <ul><li>Most lifestyle changes have no strong evidence to support them but may benefit the overall health of women with PMS symptoms. </li></ul></li></ul><h5>Simple analgesics</h5><ul><li>CKS found no evidence on the efficacy of paracetamol and commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of PMS symptoms. They have been recommended for headache and general aches and pains associated with PMS in line with accepted clinical practice.</li></ul><h5>Complementary treatments and dietary supplements</h5><ul><li>Evidence identified by the RCOG showed [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/premenstrual-syndrome/references/\">BJOG, 2016</a>]:<ul><li>Benefit for calcium and vitamin D, <em>Vitex agnus-castus L</em>., and saffron.</li><li>Some benefit for exercise, reflexology, ginkgo biloba, evening primrose oil, acupuncture, lemon balm, curcumin, and wheat germ.</li><li>Mixed results for vitamin B6, magnesium, isoflavones, and St John’s Wort.</li><li>Unknown benefit for multivitamins.</li></ul></li><li>The RCOG advises that although there is limited evidence to support the use of complementary treatments, some women with PMS, especially those in whom hormonal therapy is contraindicated, may benefit from a holistic approach. However, interactions with conventional medicines should be considered [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/premenstrual-syndrome/references/\">BJOG, 2016</a>]. The RCOG warns that it is important to evaluate evidence carefully for PMS as there is a 36–43% placebo response [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/premenstrual-syndrome/references/\">BJOG, 2016</a>]. </li><li>Limited evidence from a subsequent Cochrane systematic review (search date: October 2017) suggests that acupuncture and acupressure may improve both physical and psychological symptoms of PMS when compared with a sham control. Due to the very low quality of the evidence, it was uncertain whether acupuncture reduces PMS symptoms compared with a no treatment control. No trials compared acupuncture or acupressure with current recommended treatments for PMS, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/premenstrual-syndrome/references/\">Armour, 2018</a>].</li></ul><h5>New-generation combined oral contraceptives (COCs)</h5><ul><li>Despite the overall lack of evidence, COCs are commonly prescribed for PMS because they suppress ovulation, which is thought to contribute to PMS [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/premenstrual-syndrome/references/\">Ismaili, 2016</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/premenstrual-syndrome/references/\">BJOG, 2016</a>].</li><li>The RCOG recommends the use of new-generation COCs because they produce fewer adverse effects and there is some evidence supporting their efficacy in the treatment of PMS [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/premenstrual-syndrome/references/\">BJOG, 2016</a>]. Second-generation COCs are considered to be less useful because the progestogens they contain (for example levonorgestrel or norethisterone) can reproduce PMS-type symptoms in some women [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/premenstrual-syndrome/references/\">BJOG, 2016</a>]. </li><li>There is more evidence to support the use of drospirenone-containing COCs (for example Yasmin<sup>®</sup>) than other preparations. <ul><li>Evidence from a Cochrane systematic review (search date: December 2011) showed that compared with placebo, drospirenone 3 mg plus ethinyl estradiol 20 micrograms is beneficial when used for up to three cycles in women with severe PMS [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/premenstrual-syndrome/references/\">Lopez et al, 2012</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/premenstrual-syndrome/references/\">BJOG, 2016</a>]. However, larger and longer trials of higher quality are needed to assess whether the COC works after three cycles, helps women with less severe symptoms, or is better than other oral contraceptives [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/premenstrual-syndrome/references/\">Lopez et al, 2012</a>].</li></ul></li><li>Expert opinion of previous reviewers of this CKS topic is that other COCs, particularly those containing norgestimate (for example Cilest<sup>®</sup>), gestodene (for example Femodene<sup>®</sup>), or desogestrel (for example Marvelon<sup>®</sup>), may also be effective, especially if they have been used before and have been found to be of benefit.</li><li>The RCOG recommends continuous rather than cyclical treatment based on evidence supporting the former regimen for the treatment of PMS.</li></ul><h5>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</h5><ul><li>The RCOG recommends CBT as a treatment option for women with severe PMS based on evidence of efficacy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/premenstrual-syndrome/references/\">BJOG, 2016</a>]. CKS also recommends CBT in women with moderate PMS if, based on clinical judgement, it is felt that psychological treatment may be useful.</li></ul><h5>SSRIs</h5><ul><li>The RCOG recommends luteal or continuous SSRIs as a first-line treatment option for women with severe PMS as there is increasing evidence that serotonin may be important in the pathogenesis of PMS [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/premenstrual-syndrome/references/\">BJOG, 2016</a>].<ul><li>A Cochrane systematic review (search date: February 2013) identified by the RCOG found evidence that fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, and citalopram are effective at reducing premenstrual symptoms compared with placebo. However, they are associated with dose-related adverse effects, such as nausea, asthenia or decreased energy, somnolence, fatigue or sedation, decreased libido, and sweating. The evidence also suggests that continuous and luteal-phase regimens are both effective, but uncertainty remains as to which is more effective [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/premenstrual-syndrome/references/\">Marjoribanks et al, 2013</a>].</li><li>The recommended doses of SSRIs are based on the most commonly used doses in clinical studies [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/premenstrual-syndrome/references/\">Marjoribanks et al, 2013</a>].
