The quality of itch is variable — it may be described as a burning, prickling, or crawling sensation.</li><li> The causes of itch are widespread, although the mechanism is not well understood. Dry skin, skin conditions such as eczema, underlying systemic disease, certain drugs, and psychological conditions can all cause itch.</li><li>Factors such as the nature of the itch; its location, onset, timing and duration; and relieving factors or associated symptoms; drug and dietary history; contact with others who may have itch; history of alcohol misuse, emotional stress and mental health problems can all help to determine whether there is an underlying cause.</li><li>If there is no sign of active skin disease and an underlying cause is not obvious, the following tests should be requested:</li><ul><li>Full blood count and blood film. </li><li>Liver function tests. </li><li>Renal function tests. </li><li>Serum iron and ferritin levels. </li><li>Thyroid function tests. </li><li>Fasting blood glucose.</li><li>ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), CRP (C-reactive protein), or plasma viscosity, depending on local availability.<br></li></ul><li>Self-care measures such as bathing less frequently, using cooler water, and reducing the amount of time spent in the bath; keeping cool, wearing clothing that does not irritate the skin (for example cotton or silk); and avoiding spicy foods, alcohol, and caffeine may help to alleviate symptoms.<br></li><li>An emollient may relieve itch associated with dry skin. If this does not provide adequate relief, an emollient with an active ingredient (for example menthol 0.5% or 1% in aqueous cream) or topical crotamiton may be helpful.<br></li><li>Any underlying cause should be managed appropriately. </li><li>If there is doubt about whether there is an underlying cause for the itch, or symptoms are not controlled with emollients or self-care strategies, refer the person to a dermatologist.</li><li>If the itch persists despite treatment with self-care measures and emollients, a 2-week trial of a sedating antihistamine (for example hydroxyzine or chlorphenamine at night) can be tried. </li><li>For people with a known cause of itch, drug treatment in the longer term may be helpful, but only on specialist advice. Options include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, gabapentin, mirtazapine, and tricyclic antidepressants.</li></ul><!-- end field ede0f374-8f9e-4085-8e84-9810313cc01e --><!-- end item f3b26c31-2dc4-4ed6-8a4c-b17707dfaa23 -->","topic":{"id":"98db983b-94d0-57fc-8f85-3c35dffdbc84","topicId":"3ff60e1b-3717-41cc-be12-1871b4284ba6","topicName":"Itch -
