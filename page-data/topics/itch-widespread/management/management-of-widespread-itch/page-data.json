They are usually used at a low concentration (for example 0.5&ndash;1%) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Davies, 2007</a>].</li></ul><p><strong>Topical crotamiton</strong></p><ul><li>CKS found no evidence on the use of topical crotamiton for widespread itch, although it is licensed for use in people with scabies and itchy skin conditions [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">ABPI Medicines Compendium, 2014a</a>].&nbsp;Most previous expert reviewers of this CKS topic considered a trial of its use for one or two weeks to be reasonable for widespread itch if other treatments have been unsuccessful. However, given the lack of evidence and its increased cost compared with emollients, it is recommended as a second-line treatment option by CKS.</li></ul><p><strong>Antihistamines</strong></p><ul><li>CKS identified no controlled trials that investigated the use of antihistamines for widespread itch caused by cholestasis, renal failure, or malignancy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Davis et al, 2003</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Greaves, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">O'Donoghue and Tharp, 2005</a>],&nbsp;or itch of unknown cause. Some experts suggest that unless the itch is caused by a histamine-induced process (for example mastocytosis), the efficacy of antihistamines is limited [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Summey and Yosipovitch, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Lynde et al, 2008</a>]. However, the expert opinion of previous external reviewers of this CKS topic was that a trial of treatment with a sedative antihistamine at night for 2&nbsp;weeks may offer symptomatic relief; it should be discontinued after this time if there is no effect.</li><li>Chlorphenamine and hydroxyzine are recommended as options on the basis of expert opinion in a review article which suggests that first-generation antihistamines are more sedating than second-generation antihistamines (for example cetirizine and loratadine) and may therefore be useful for night-time [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">O'Donoghue and Tharp, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Patel, 2010</a>].</li><li>Sedating oral antihistamines probably provide relief from nocturnal scratching by inducing sedation, helping to break the itch-scratch cycle (as occurs for other itchy conditions such as pruritus vulvae) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Weichert, 2004</a>].&nbsp;Therefore, they may have a beneficial effect in people with itch.</li><li>The suggested doses of chlorphenamine and hydroxyzine are consistent with those in the British National Formulary [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">BNF 70, 2015</a>]&nbsp;and the British National Formulary for Children [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">BNF for Children, 2015</a>].</li></ul><p><strong>Specialist drug treatment</strong></p><ul><li>Experts recommend additional drug treatment for widespread itch if there is a specific indication or other treatments (such as self care and emollients) have been used without success [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Lynde et al, 2008</a>]. However, because of the weak evidence on drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, gabapentin, pregabalin, mirtazapine, and tricyclic antidepressants, and the fact that none of them are licensed for the treatment of itch, CKS does not recommend their use except on specialist advice.</li></ul><p><strong>Treatments not recommended</strong></p><ul><li>A number of products are available that have been used to treat itch, but are not&nbsp;recommended by CKS for widespread itch when there is no identifiable underlying skin condition:<ul><li>Topical anaesthetic &mdash; not recommended because expert opinion recommends avoiding excessive application and using it for a maximum of 3&nbsp;days (because of the risk of systemic absorption) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">BNF 70, 2015</a>]. This is not a practical option for people with widespread itch. Topical anaesthetics are also associated with an increased risk of allergic sensitization [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Moses, 2003</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Lynde et al, 2008</a>].</li><li>Topical antihistamine &mdash; not effective for widespread itch and expert opinion suggests there may be adverse effects (including allergic sensitization) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Moses, 2003</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Hercogova, 2005</a>].</li><li>Topical capsaicin &mdash; not recommended by experts as it requires frequent application and may cause a burning sensation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Davies, 2007</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">ABPI Medicines Compendium, 2014b</a>]. These factors reduce its value for use over a large body surface area, as is required in widespread itch. A systematic review found no convincing evidence to support the use of capsaicin for treating itch [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Gooding et al, 2010</a>].</li><li>Topical corticosteroids &mdash; not recommended by experts for widespread itch because of their potential adverse effects, including skin atrophy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Moses, 2003</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Yosipovitch and Hundley, 2004</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Elmariah, 2011</a>].</li><li>Topical doxepin &mdash; used for itch associated with atopic dermatitis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Lynde et al, 2008</a>]. However, experts state that coverage should be limited to less than 10% of the body surface area because of the risk of sedation from percutaneous absorption [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Yosipovitch and Hundley, 2004</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Davies, 2007</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Elmariah, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">BNF 70, 2015</a>]; therefore, it is not suitable for widespread itch.</li><li>Oral corticosteroids &mdash; not recommended by CKS for the treatment of itch, unless there is an underlying condition for which they are indicated.

Most previous reviewers of this CKS topic consider a trial of its use for one or two weeks to be reasonable for widespread itch if other treatments have been unsatisfactory. However, given the lack of evidence and its increased cost compared with emollients, it is recommended as a second-line treatment option by CKS.</li></ul><p><strong>Referral</strong></p><ul><li>The recommendations are pragmatic and based on what CKS considers to be good clinical practice.</li></ul><p><strong>Antihistamines</strong></p><ul><li>CKS identified no controlled trials that investigated the use of antihistamines for widespread itch caused&nbsp;by cholestasis, renal failure, or malignancy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Davis et al, 2003</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Greaves, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">O'Donoghue and Tharp, 2005</a>], or itch of unknown cause. Some experts suggest that unless the itch is caused by a histamine-induced process (for example mastocytosis), the efficacy of antihistamines is limited [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Summey and Yosipovitch, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Lynde et al, 2008</a>]. However, the expert opinion of previous external reviewers of this CKS topic was that a trial of treatment with a sedative antihistamine at night for 2&nbsp;weeks may offer symptomatic relief; it should be discontinued after this time if there is no effect.</li><li>Chlorphenamine and hydroxyzine are recommended as options on the basis of expert opinion in a review article which suggests that first-generation antihistamines (for example chlorphenamine and hydroxyzine) are more sedating than second-generation antihistamines (for example cetirizine and loratadine) and may therefore be useful for night time [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">O'Donoghue and Tharp, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Patel, 2010</a>].</li><li>Sedating oral antihistamines probably provide relief from nocturnal scratching by inducing sedation, helping to break the itch-scratch cycle (as occurs for other itchy conditions such as pruritus vulvae) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Weichert, 2004</a>]. Therefore, they may have a beneficial effect in people with itch of unknown cause.</li></ul><p><strong>Additional drug treatment for widespread itch &nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>CKS identified only weak evidence on gabapentin and pregabalin for the treatment of widespread itch of uncertain or no underlying cause&nbsp;[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Yesudian and Wilson, 2005</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Ehrchen and Stander, 2008</a>].</li><li>Due to the low quality of this evidence and the fact that neither of these drugs are licensed for treatment of itch, CKS recommends they are not prescribed in primary care except on specialist advice.</li></ul><p><strong>Treatments not recommended</strong></p><ul><li>A number of products are available that have been used to treat itch, but are not&nbsp;recommended by CKS for widespread itch when there is no identifiable underlying skin condition:<ul><li>Topical anaesthetic &mdash; not recommended because expert opinion recommends avoiding excessive application and using it for a maximum of 3&nbsp;days (because of the risk of systemic absorption) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">BNF 70, 2015</a>]. This is not a practical option for people with widespread itch. Topical anaesthetics are also associated with an increased risk of allergic sensitization [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Moses, 2003</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Lynde et al, 2008</a>].</li><li>Topical antihistamine &mdash; not effective for widespread itch and expert opinion suggests there may be adverse effects (including allergic sensitization) [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Moses, 2003</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Hercogova, 2005</a>].</li><li>Topical capsaicin &mdash; not recommended by experts as it requires frequent application and may cause a burning sensation [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Davies, 2007</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">ABPI Medicines Compendium, 2014b</a>]. These factors reduce its value for use over a large body surface area, as is required in widespread itch.&nbsp;A systematic review found no convincing evidence to support the use of capsaicin for treating itch&nbsp;[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Gooding et al, 2010</a>].</li><li>Topical corticosteroids &mdash; not recommended by experts for widespread itch because of their potential adverse effects, including skin atrophy [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Moses, 2003</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Yosipovitch and Hundley, 2004</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Elmariah, 2011</a>].</li><li>Topical doxepin &mdash; used for itch associated with atopic dermatitis [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Lynde et al, 2008</a>]. However, experts state that coverage should be limited to less than 10% of the body surface area because of the risk of sedation from percutaneous absorption [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Yosipovitch and Hundley, 2004</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Davies, 2007</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">Elmariah, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/itch-widespread/references/\">BNF 70, 2015</a>]; therefore, it is not suitable for widespread itch.</li><li>Oral corticosteroids &mdash; not recommended by CKS for the treatment of itch, unless there is an underlying condition for which they are indicated.
