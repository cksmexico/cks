activities of daily living (ADLs).</li><ul><li>It affects more than one cognitive domain (for example memory, language, orientation, or judgement) and social behaviour (for example, emotional control or motivation).</li></ul><li>Early (or young) onset dementia is generally defined as dementia that develops before 65 years of age.</li><li>Mild cognitive impairment is cognitive impairment that does not fulfil the diagnostic criteria for dementia — for example, only one cognitive domain is affected, or ADLs are not significantly affected.</li><li>The most common subtypes of dementia include:</li><ul><li>Alzheimer's disease (50–75%) which often co-exists with vascular dementia.</li><li>Vascular dementia (up to 20%).</li><li>Dementia with Lewy bodies (10–15%).</li><li>Frontotemporal dementia (2%).</li></ul><li>Modification of specific risk factors (in particular, cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, diabetes and lack of physical activity) can delay or prevent the onset of dementia.</li><li>Early diagnosis of dementia is important for treatment of reversible causes and advance planning while a person still has mental capacity.</li><li>Dementia should be suspected if any of the following are reported by the person or their family/carer:</li><ul><li>Cognitive impairment leading to memory problems (such as difficulty learning new information), dysphasia and dyspraxia, disorientation to time and place and impairment of executive function (such as difficulty with planning and problem solving).</li><li>Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), such as delusions, hallucinations, agitation, emotional lability, depression, anxiety, apathy, social or sexual disinhibition, motor disturbance (for example wandering or repetitive activity), and sleep disruption.<br></li><li>Difficulties with ADLs, such as eating, personal hygiene, grooming and dressing, and making mistakes at work.</li></ul><li>Cognitive assessment (with a validated tool) should be performed in all people suspected of having dementia.</li><li>Routine investigations should be requested in order to exclude other conditions, such as depression, hypothyroidism and delirium.</li><li>All people with suspected dementia or mild cognitive impairment should be referred to a memory assessment service for specialist assessment and management.</li><ul><li>Admission or urgent referral (to psychiatry or neurology) may be required in certain situations.</li></ul><li>Management of dementia involves:</li><ul><li>Coordination between primary, secondary, and social care.</li><li>Provision of information on dementia such as, prognosis, treatment and sources of support (for the person and their family/carer).</li><li>Enabling people with dementia to give informed consent — mental capacity should be assumed until proven otherwise.</li><li>Advance care planning.</li><li>Assessment of, and appropriate intervention for, physical and mental health and functional disability.</li><li>Assessment of carer needs and appropriate management of any mental and physical health problems as they arise.</li><li>Drug treatment for cognitive symptoms of dementia — this is initiated by a specialist, but may be continued and monitored by a GP under a shared-care protocol.</li><li>Prevention and management of BPSD, as far as possible, with non-pharmacological interventions — uncontrolled pain and discomfort are common precipitants of BPSD.</li><li>Structured follow up.</li><li>Appropriate end-of-life care.</li></ul></ul><!-- end field 8cf4c13c-15f2-4cde-a881-321100e8cbf4 --><!-- end item 2fadc1a1-5aeb-4c18-9321-27f2142659b1
