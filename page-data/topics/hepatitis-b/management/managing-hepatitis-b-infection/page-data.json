The EMA review confirmed the well-known risks of neurological effects such as short-term extrapyramidal adverse effects. This risk is higher in children, although tardive dyskinesia was reported more often in the elderly, and the risk is increased at high doses or with long-term treatment. The EMA states that the risks outweighed the benefits of metoclopramide in conditions requiring long-term treatment. There have also been very rare cases of serious cardiovascular adverse effects, particularly after injection of the drug.</li></ul></li><li>The recommendations to try simple measures and to consider offering chlorphenamine to treat itch are based on the opinion of previous expert reviewers of this CKS topic.

However, the evidence is based on old, small, case-control studies and is considered to be weak.
