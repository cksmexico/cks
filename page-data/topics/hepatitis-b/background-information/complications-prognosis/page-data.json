If present, however, it can progress rapidly to life-threatening liver failure with coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and cerebral oedema.</li><li>The mortality of acute hepatitis B is less than 1%.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Chronic HBV infection </strong>(persistence of HBsAg in the circulation for more than 6 months) occurs in:<ul><li>Up to 15% of infants born to hepatitis B–positive mothers, if they are not immunized from birth.</li><li>Between 10% and 20% of children infected in later childhood.</li><li>Approximately 4% of healthy adults who acquire hepatitis B infection. However, rates of chronicity are higher in adults who are immunocompromised, have HIV infection, or chronic renal failure.</li></ul></li><li><strong>There is a risk of extrahepatic manifestations </strong>such as glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, and polyarteritis with both acute and chronic infection.</li><li><strong>It is possible to have chronic HBV infection but not chronic hepatitis</strong>. Liver inflammation and fibrosis in chronic HBV is caused by the immune response. </li><li><strong>Chronic infection involves five distinct phases, with different prognoses. Each phase depends on the interplay between HBV replication and the person's immune response. </strong>Phases are characterised by factors including the presence or absence of serum <a class=\"topic-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-b/background-information/complications-prognosis/\">antibodies and antigens</a> (particularly to hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg]), HBV DNA levels, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values (as a marker of liver necroinflammation) as follows:<ul><li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> HBeAg-positive chronic HBV infection (also known as the 'immune tolerant' phase) —  suggested by positive serum HBeAg, very high levels of HBV DNA and normal ALT. Usually occurs during the initial 15-30 years of infection. The person is likely to be very infectious. No treatment is generally required. However, 1.7% to 4.5% of children and adolescents infected at birth have cirrhosis at liver biopsy, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can occur.</li><li><strong>Phase 2: </strong>HBeAg-positive chronic HBV infection (also known as the 'immune clearance' phase)  — suggested by positive serum HBeAg, high levels of HBV DNA, and elevated ALT. May occur after several years of the first phase but may be more common/reached more quickly in people infected during adulthood. Progressive liver fibrosis and significant necroinflammation are often observed. During this phase, some people spontaneously seroconvert from HBeAg positive to negative, and develop antibodies to HBeAg (anti-HBe).</li><li><strong>Phase 3: </strong>HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection (also known as the ‘inactive carrier’ phase) — suggested by serum antibodies to HBeAg (anti-HBe), undetectable or low HBV DNA levels, and normal ALT. People remaining in this phase have low risk of progression to cirrhosis or HCC.</li><li><strong>Phase 4:</strong> HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (also known as the 'immune escape' phase) — represents reactivation of the hepatitis B virus. Suggested by lack of serum HBeAg, usually with detectable anti-HBe, and persistent or fluctuating moderate to high levels of HBV DNA, as well as fluctuating or persistently elevated ALT. People in this phase exhibit liver inflammation and progressive fibrosis, are at high risk of progression to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and rarely experience spontaneous disease remission.</li><li><strong>Phase 5:</strong> HBsAg-negative phase (also known as 'occult HBV infection') — characterised by serum negative HBsAg and positive antibodies to HBcAg (anti-HBc), with or without detectable antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs). People in this phase have normal ALT values and HBV DNA is usually undetectable. If HBsAg was lost before the onset of cirrhosis, this phase is associated with a minimal risk of cirrhosis, decompensation and HCC, and improved survival. However, if cirrhosis developed before HBsAg loss, the risk of HCC remains. Immunosuppression may lead to HBV reactivation in these people.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Without antiviral treatment, the 5-year cumulative incidence of cirrhosis in adults with chronic hepatitis B is 8% to 20%. </strong><ul><li>People with cirrhosis are at significant risk of decompensated liver disease if they remain untreated.</li><li>Five-year survival rates among people with untreated decompensated cirrhosis can be as low as 15%.</li><li>Alcohol consumption or co-infection with hepatitis C, hepatitis D, or HIV can lead to faster progression of liver damage, and increase the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer (HCC).</li><li>There is a 2–5% annual risk of developing HCC in people who progress to cirrhosis, and this is detected an average of 30 years after initial infection. Cancer is more likely to develop when there is active liver inflammation, virus replication and rapid cell turnover. The prognosis is poor unless it is diagnosed very early. Note: While cirrhosis appears to be the most significant risk factor for HCC, 30% to 50% of HBV-related HCC occurs in the absence of cirrhosis.</li></ul></li></ul><p>[<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-b/references/\">British Liver Trust, 2009</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-b/references/\">Koziel and Thio, 2010</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-b/references/\">Aspinall et al, 2011</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-b/references/\">Davison and Strasser, 2014</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-b/references/\">Sundaram and Kowdley, 2015</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-b/references/\">BASHH, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-b/references/\">British Liver Trust, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-b/references/\">EASL, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-b/references/\">NICE, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-b/references/\">PHE, 2017</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/hepatitis-b/references/\">BMJ Best Practice, 2018</a>]</p><!-- end field e9ffbbad-f994-43d7-b9e2-c36155468d42 --><!-- end item 684cdf16-7908-4ef4-bab2-6526fcbacd5a -->","topic":{"id":"f75dcfde-3cb4-5059-94df-19d53a6c28e9","topicId":"4fc86266-0752-4667-994f-7f6fc7e46056","topicName":"Hepatitis B","slug":"hepatitis-b","lastRevised":"Last revised in November 2019","chapters":[{"id":"986057cd-07a1-565e-9c7a-d3b3dc88368d","fullItemName":"Summary","slug":"summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"2331f5c5-fb51-54d1-b722-946b4f34a693","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","subChapters":[]},{"id":"653459fe-510a-5a1a-92dc-8197c598c85e","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","subChapters":[{"id":"12e8fb8c-9424-5f20-90e5-65e823f603c3","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"2299e2ba-3fb3-5f37-9c6b-63ec8dbbffd6","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"c14d3383-629b-5bd6-b6c0-318bbcf86fb2","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","subChapters":[{"id":"58e5cd67-9ca7-5bfe-b2b6-bf4372ac895f","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"a1abbdfd-238b-55b7-8de2-09fd4ff6065b","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"fc44420e-13ab-526e-a0c7-ef2f93cce77b","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"b59d4642-5914-585b-82b1-6f7989cef100","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"af246587-2615-513e-aafc-3ea762d8aab7","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
