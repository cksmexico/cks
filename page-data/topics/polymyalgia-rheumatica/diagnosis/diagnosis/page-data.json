Corticosteroids have not been evaluated in placebo-controlled clinical trials, and it is unlikely that these would ever take place because the effect of corticosteroids is so dramatic.</li><li>The BSR/BHPR and EULAR/ACR guidelines recommend the use of intramuscular methylprednisolone in milder cases of PMR [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polymyalgia-rheumatica/references/\">Dasgupta et al, 2009</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polymyalgia-rheumatica/references/\">Dasgupta, 2010</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polymyalgia-rheumatica/references/\">Dejaco, 2015</a>]. However, CKS does not recommend this because intramuscular methylprednisolone is not routinely used in primary care.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Excluding other conditions</strong><ul><li>Although a response to corticosteroids is considered by some to be the main defining feature of PMR, there were concerns from the BSR and BHPR that the anti-inflammatory properties of corticosteroids can mask symptoms of a number of other conditions, including cancer, infection, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and rotator cuff problems [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polymyalgia-rheumatica/references/\">Dasgupta et al, 2009</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polymyalgia-rheumatica/references/\">Dasgupta, 2010</a>]. Therefore, these should be excluded before corticosteroid treatment is commenced.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Recommended dose of corticosteroids</strong><ul><li>A consensus of 90% of the experts contributing to the BSR/BHPR guideline agreed that 15 mg of oral prednisolone daily is the most appropriate starting dose for a person with suspected PMR. This is supported by observational studies using doses between 10 mg and 20 mg. Doses of less than 10 mg were associated with a higher rate of relapse, and doses higher than 20 mg were associated with more adverse events [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polymyalgia-rheumatica/references/\">Dasgupta et al, 2009</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polymyalgia-rheumatica/references/\">Dasgupta, 2010</a>].</li></ul></li><li><strong>Making a working diagnosis of PMR</strong><ul><li>The definition of a response to corticosteroids (global improvement of 70% within a week and normalization of inflammatory markers within 4 weeks) was agreed by more than three quarters of the BSR/BHPR guideline consensus group [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polymyalgia-rheumatica/references/\">Dasgupta et al, 2009</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polymyalgia-rheumatica/references/\">Dasgupta, 2010</a>].</li><li>Early referral for people with a poor response to corticosteroids is based on the expert opinion of the authors of the BSR/BHPR guideline that a poor response to treatment may be indicative of a serious underlying condition being the cause of symptoms [<a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polymyalgia-rheumatica/references/\">Dasgupta et al, 2009</a>; <a class=\"bibliography-reference internal-reference\" href=\"/topics/polymyalgia-rheumatica/references/\">Dasgupta, 2010</a>].<br> </li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 8ae1582c-8693-4200-83c3-6e5c2fce5007 --><!-- end item b1f21bfe-bc6d-40a5-b13d-250df3dbc096 -->","subChapters":[]}]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3666801979"]}
