It is seldom diagnosed in people younger than 50 years of age. </li><li>Female gender — PMR is more common in women than men, with a lifetime risk of 2.4% for women and 1.7% for men. </li><li>Northern European ancestry — PMR is most common in people of Northern European ancestry.</li><li>Infection — cyclic fluctuations and peaks in incidence have been observed in the winter and associated mycoplasma, chlamydia pneumonia, and parvovirus B19 infections. </li></ul></li><li>PMR is the most common inflammatory rheumatic disease in older people and one of the most common indications for long-term corticosteroid treatment in the UK.</li><li>Complications include:<ul><li>Giant cell arteritis (GCA), which may occur abruptly and without warning early in the course of PMR.</li><li>Complications of long-term corticosteroid treatment.</li></ul></li><li>The prognosis of PMR is variable.<ul><li>The response to systemic corticosteroids is usually rapid and dramatic, with many symptoms resolving after a few days of treatment.</li><li>Treatment for 1–2 years is often required, and some people may need low-dose corticosteroids for several years.</li><li>Relapse is common, but responds to restarting or increasing the dose of systemic corticosteroids.</li></ul></li><li>PMR should be suspected in a person older than 50 years of age presenting with:<ul><li>Bilateral shoulder and/or pelvic girdle aching lasting more than 2 weeks.</li><li>Morning stiffness (for more than 45 minutes).</li><li>Evidence of an acute phase response.</li><li>Other more general symptoms, such as low-grade fever, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, or depression.</li></ul></li><li>A working diagnosis of PMR should be made from a combination of the following:<ul><li>Presence of core features of the condition.</li><li>Exclusion of differential diagnoses, such as rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia.</li><li>A positive response to oral corticosteroids within a week.</li><li>Normalization of inflammatory markers within 4 weeks.</li></ul></li><li>Referral to a rheumatologist should be made if there is doubt about the diagnosis, for example, because:<ul><li>There are atypical features of PMR, such as no evidence of an acute phase response and no clear alternative diagnosis.</li><li>There is a poor response to corticosteroids.</li></ul></li><li>Management of a person with a working diagnosis of PMR involves:<ul><li>Gradually reducing the dose of corticosteroids when symptoms are fully controlled, adjusting the size of each dose reduction and the duration at each dose to avoid relapses.</li><li>Assessing for, and managing, symptoms of relapse, GCA, and steroid-related adverse effects.</li><li>Assessing and managing the risk of osteoporosis.</li><li>Providing appropriate information and advice.</li></ul></li><li>Referral to a rheumatologist is recommended for people diagnosed with PMR if:<ul><li>It is not possible to reduce corticosteroids at reasonable intervals without causing relapse.</li><li>Corticosteroids are required for more than 2 years.</li></ul></li></ul><!-- end field 63eadb04-03d4-4e1c-b7ac-66dab84beac7 --><!-- end item 038a01d8-4c63-4c93-94fa-dc3ae47751d6 -->","topic":{"id":"ce8b01ca-f53a-55a3-8d34-3f1c4627fe6a","topicId":"ad21d80a-1ea5-4ead-b50d-c84a90f81dfd","topicName":"Polymyalgia rheumatica","slug":"polymyalgia-rheumatica","aliases":[],"chapters":[{"id":"1422f739-c18d-5e1e-a304-97c38c53326d","slug":"summary","fullItemName":"Summary","subChapters":[]},{"id":"16d2834f-dff7-5cdb-a7f4-58e78255d2d2","slug":"have-i-got-the-right-topic","fullItemName":"Have I got the right topic?","subChapters":[]},{"id":"e0b8f18b-6f9c-5652-83d0-dafbd8f023f1","slug":"how-up-to-date-is-this-topic","fullItemName":"How up-to-date is this topic?","subChapters":[{"id":"45868673-afab-57d2-a5d7-8e82c7a6a1d6","slug":"changes","fullItemName":"Changes"},{"id":"5b1ee373-bd86-5e9d-812b-4832f6246571","slug":"update","fullItemName":"Update"}]},{"id":"27cf37e3-9a75-54bf-b40c-a9a5d3ab8774","slug":"goals-outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Goals and outcome measures","subChapters":[{"id":"f98bc06e-32e0-5d1b-955b-704d835dadfc","slug":"goals","fullItemName":"Goals"},{"id":"de16a1ee-5b79-561d-aa33-007310d41806","slug":"outcome-measures","fullItemName":"Outcome measures"},{"id":"27fd23e5-8ea0-5fc4-a238-92290ecf2d96","slug":"audit-criteria","fullItemName":"Audit criteria"},{"id":"07ae7b26-b61c-5b1d-a11a-2e2f8831b2b4","slug":"qof-indicators","fullItemName":"QOF indicators"},{"id":"40fc7a60-984c-568d-bca4-9c74b0dd12ad","slug":"qipp-options-for-local-implementation","fullItemName":"QIPP -
